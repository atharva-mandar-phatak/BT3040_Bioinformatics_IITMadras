* POU-specific (POUs) domain signatures and profile *
*****************************************************

The POU  (pronounced 'pow') domain [1 to 7 ] is a highly charged 155-162-amino
acid region  of  sequence  similarity  which  has been identified in the three
mammalian transcription  factors Pit-1, Oct-1, and Oct-2 and in the product of
the nematode  gene  unc-86.  The POU domain is a bipartite DNA binding protein
module that  binds  selectively to the DNA octamer motif ATGCAAAT and a subset
of derivatives. It consists of two subdomains, a C-terminal homeodomain (POUh)
(see <PDOC00027>)  and  an  N-terminal  75-  to 82-residue POU-specific (POUs)
region separated  by  a short non-conserved linker. The POU-specific region or
'box' can  be  subdivided  further into two highly conserved regions, A and B,
separated by  a less highly conserved segment. The POUs domain is always found
in association with a POUh domain, and both are required for high affinity and
sequence-specific DNA binding.

The POUs  domain consists of four alpha helices packed to enclose an extensive
hydrophobic core  (see  <PDB:1POU>).  The  POUs domain contains an unusual HTH
structure, which  differs  from  the  canonical HTH motif in the length of the
first alpha helix and the turn. The region of hypervariability located between
subdomains A  and  B  lies within the sequence corresponding to the C-terminal
end of  helix  2  and  the linker between helices 2 and 3. In the model of the
POUs-DNA complex,  the  C-terminus  of  helix  2 and the turn of the HTH motif
project away from the DNA such that sequence variability in this region can be
accomodated without  adversely  affecting DNA binding [8].

Some proteins currently known to contain a POUs domain are listed below:

 - Oct-1  (or  OTF-1,  NF-A1)  (gene POU2F1), a transcription factor for small
   nuclear RNA and histone H2B genes.
 - Oct-2  (or  OTF-2,  NF-A2)  (gene  POU2F2),  a  transcription  factor  that
   specifically binds  to  the  immunoglobulin  promoters  octamer  motif  and
   activates these genes.
 - Oct-3  (or  Oct-4,  NF-A3)  (gene POU5F1), a transcription factor that also
   binds to the octamer motif.
 - Oct-6    (or   OTF-6, SCIP) (gene POU3F1), an octamer-binding transcription
   factor thought to be involved in early embryogenesis and neurogenesis.
 - Oct-7  (or  N-Oct 3, OTF-7, Brn-2) (gene POU3F2), a nervous-system specific
   octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Oct-11 (or OTF-11) (gene POU2F3), an octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Pit-1  (or  GHF-1)  (gene  POU1F1),  a transcription factor that  activates
   growth hormone and prolactin genes.
 - Brn-1 (or OTF-8) (gene POU3F3).
 - Brn-3A (or RDC-1) (gene POU4F1), a probable transcription factor  that  may
   play a role in neuronal tissue differentiation.
 - Brn-3B (gene POU4F2), a probable transcription factor  that may play a role
   in determining  or  maintaining  the identities of a small subset of visual
   system neurons.
 - Brn-3C (gene POU4F3).
 - Brn-4 (or OTF-9) (gene POU3F4), a probable transcription factor which exert
   its primary  action  widely  during  early neural development and in a very
   limited set of neurons in the mature brain.
 - Mpou  (or  Brn-5,  Emb)  (gene  POU6F1),  a transcription factor that binds
   preferentially to a variant of the octamer motif.
 - Skn, that activates cytokeratin 10 (k10) gene expression.
 - Sprm-1,  a  transcription  factor  that binds preferentially to the octamer
   motif and  that  may exert a regulatory function in meiotic events that are
   required for terminal differentiation of male germ cell.
 - Unc-86,  a  Caenorhabditis  elegans  transcription  factor involved in cell
   lineage and differentiation.
 - Cf1-a, a Drosophila neuron-specific  transcription factor necessary for the
   expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (dcc).
 - I-POU, a Drosophila protein that forms a stable heterodimeric  complex with
   Cf1-a and inhibits its action.
 - Drosophila protein nubbin/twain (PDM-1 or DPou-19).
 - Drosophila protein didymous (PDM-2 or DPou-28) that may play multiple roles
   during development.
 - Bombyx mori silk gland factor 3 (SGF-3).
 - Xenopus proteins Pou1, Pou2, and Pou3.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pou1, Pou2, Pou[C], ZP-12, ZP-23, ZP-47 and ZP-50.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-6.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-18.

We  have derived  two  signature patterns for the 'POU' domain.  The first one
spans positions 15 to 27 of the domain, the second positions 42 to 55. We have
also developed a profile which covers the entire POUs domain.
