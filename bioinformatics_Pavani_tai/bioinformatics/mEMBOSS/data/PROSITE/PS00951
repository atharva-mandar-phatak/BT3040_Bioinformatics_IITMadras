* ER lumen protein retaining receptor signatures *
**************************************************

Proteins that reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) contain a
C-terminal tetrapeptide (generally K-D-E-L or H-D-E-L) that serves as a signal
for their retrieval (retrograde transport) from subsequent compartments of the
secretory pathway.  The  signal  is  recognized by a receptor molecule that is
believed to cycle between the cis side  of the Golgi apparatus and the ER [1].
This protein  is known  as the  ER lumen protein retaining receptor or also as
the 'KDEL  receptor'.  It  has  been  characterized  in  a variety of species,
including  fungi (gene  ERD2), plants, Plasmodium,  Drosophila and mammals. In
mammals two highly related forms of the receptor are known.

Structurally, the   receptor is a protein of about 220 residues that seems  to
contain seven transmembrane regions [2].  The  N-terminal part (3 residues) is
oriented toward the  lumen  while  the C-terminal  tail (about 12 residues) is
cytoplasmic. There are three lumenal and three cytoplasmic loops.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for these receptors. The first pattern
corresponds to  the  C-terminal  half of the first cytoplasmic loop as well as
most of  the  second  transmembrane  domain. The second pattern is a perfectly
conserved decapeptide  that  corresponds  to  the  central  part  of the fifth
transmembrane domain.
