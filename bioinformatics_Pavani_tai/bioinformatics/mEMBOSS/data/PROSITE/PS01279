*********************************************************************

Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.77) (PCMT)
[1]  (which is also known as L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase)
is an   enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  transfer  of  a  methyl  group  from  S-
adenosylmethionine to  the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl
residues in  a  variety  of  peptides and proteins. The enzyme does not act on
normal L-aspartyl  residues  L-isoaspartyl  and D-aspartyl are the products of
the spontaneous  deamidation  and/or isomerization of normal L-aspartyl and L-
asparaginyl residues  in  proteins.  PCMT  plays  a  role in the repair and/or
degradation of  these damaged proteins; the enzymatic methyl esterification of
the abnormal  residues  can  lead  to  their  conversion  to normal L-aspartyl
residues.

PCMT is a well-conserved and widely  distributed cytosolic protein of about 24
Kd. As a signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in the central part
of this enzyme.

-Consensus pattern: [GSAED]-[DN]-G-x(2)-G-[FYWLV]-x(3)-[GSA]-[PTL]-[FY]-

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
