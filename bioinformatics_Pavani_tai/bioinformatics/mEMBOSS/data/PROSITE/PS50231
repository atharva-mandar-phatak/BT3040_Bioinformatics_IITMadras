* Lectin domain of ricin B chain profile *
******************************************

Primary structure  analysis has shown the presence of a similar domain in many
carbohydrate-recognition  proteins   like   plant   and  bacterial  AB-toxins,
glycosidases or  proteases  [1,2,3].  This domain, known as the ricin B lectin
domain, can  be  present  in  one  or  more  copies and has been shown in some
instance to bind simple sugars, such as galactose or lactose.

The ricin  B  lectin  domain  is composed of three homologous subdomains of 40
amino acids (alpha, beta and gamma) and a linker peptide of around 15 residues
(lambda). It  has  been  proposed that the ricin B lectin domain arose by gene
triplication from  a  primitive  40 residue galactoside-binding peptide [4,5].
The most  characteristic, though not completely conserved, sequence feature is
the presence of a Q-W pattern. Consequently, the ricin B lectin domain as also
been refered  as the (QxW)3 domain and the three homologous regions as the QxW
repeats [2,3].  A  disulfide bond is also conserved in some of the QxW repeats
[2].

The 3D structure  of  the  ricin B chain has shown  that the three QxW repeats
pack around  a pseudo threefold axis  that is stabilised  by the lambda linker
[4].  The ricin B lectin domain has no major segments of a helix or beta sheet
but  each of the QxW repeats contains an omega loop  [5].  An idealized omega-
loop is a compact,  contiguous  segment  of  polypeptide  that traces a 'loop-
shaped' path  in  three-dimensional  space;  the  main chain resembles a Greek
omega.

Some proteins containing a ricin B lectin domain are listed below [3]:

 - Ricin,  from  Ricinus  communis  (Castor bean). Ricin belongs to a group of
   plant  AB-toxins,  which  also  contains  agglutinin  and  abrin.  Ricin is
   composed of  a  sugar-binding  subunit (B chain) that attaches to galactose
   residues presented  by  cell  surface  glycoproteins  or  glycolipids and a
   subunit (chain  A)  with  enzymatic  activity  that attacks and inactivates
   ribosomes. The B chain contains two ricin B lectin domains [4].
 - Serine  protease  I  (RPI) (EC 3.4.21.-), from Rarobacter faecitabidus [6].
   RIP is  a  serine  protease  exhibiting  lytic activity toward living yeast
   cells. It  possess  a  ricin  B  lectin  domain that is involved in mannose
   binding in its C terminal part.
 - The   bacterial   AHH1/ASH4/HlyA/VVHA   family   of  hemolysins.  Bacterial
   hemolysins are  exotoxins  that  attack blood cell membranes and cause cell
   rupture by  mechanisms  not  clearly  defined.  Proteins  belonging to this
   family possess one ricin B lectin domain.
 - Glucan    endo-1,3-beta-glucanase    (EC    3.2.1.39),    from    Oerskovia
   xanthineolytica. This  yeast-lytic  protein has a C-terminal ricin B lectin
   domain which appears to target the catalytic domain to yeast cell wall.
 - Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase   A  (EC  3.2.1.8)  (gene  xlnA), from Streptomyces.
   The C-terminal  ricin  B    lectin  domain has been proposed to bind to the
   polymeric substrate  of  this  enzyme, but no carbohydrate binding data are
   available.
 - The  macrophage  mannose  receptor  (MRC1),  from mammals. MRC1 is a Type I
   membrane receptor  protein  that  is  expressed  at  the  surface of mature
   macrophages. It  binds  mannose-  and fucose-rich carbohydrate polymers and
   appears to   mediate  phagocytic  uptake  of  foreign  microorganisms.  Its
   extracellular region  contains  8  copies  of the C-type lectin domain (see
   <PDOC00537>) and  one  ricin  B  lectin  domain  to  which no sugar binding
   function has been ascribed so far [7].
 - The  AIM1  protein,  from  mammals.  AIM1  is  a member of the beta- gamma-
   crystallin superfamily  and contains a C-terminal ricin B lectin domain. In
   human, it is associated with the control of tumorigenicity.
 - Phospholipase A2 receptor, from mammals. This proteins contains 8 copies of
   the C-type lectin domain and one N-terminal  ricin  B  lectin  domain whose
   function is unknown.
 - UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide   N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase   (EC  2.4.1.41)
   (gene GALNT1).  This  protein  catalyzes  the  initial reaction in O-linked
   oligosaccharide biosynthesis,  the  transfer of an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
   residue to  a  serine  or  threonine  residue on the protein receptor. This
   protein binds  carbohydrate as a soluble substrate and contains one copy of
   the ricin B lectin domain.
 - The  33-kDa  hemagglutinin  component  of the botulinum neurotoxin complex.
   This protein  has  two copies of the ricin B lectin domain and agglutinates
   red blood cells.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This  profile  is directed against part of the lambda linker and all of
 the three QxW repeats.
