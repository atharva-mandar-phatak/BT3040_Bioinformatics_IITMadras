*********************************************
* APSES-type HTH DNA-binding domain profile *
*********************************************

The APSES  (ASM-1,  Phd1,  StuA,  EFG1,  and  Sok2)  domain is an ~110-residue
sequence-specific DNA-binding domain found in a family of fungal transcription
factors that  regulate development or cell cycle progression. The APSES domain
is found   associated   with   ankyrin   repeats   (see   <PDOC50088>)  and  a
heterodimerization domain [1,2].

The APSES  domain consists of a six-stranded beta-sheet segment folded against
two pairs  of  alpha-helices  in  the  topology of the winged helix-turn-helix
(HTH) family  of  proteins  (see  <PDB:1L3G>).  The alphaA/alphaB helical pair
corresponds to the HTH motif [3-5].

Some proteins known to contain an APSES domain are listed below:

 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  Mlu-1  box  binding protein (MBP1), a cell cycle
   transcription factor.
 - Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  cell  division cycle-related proteins res1/sct1
   and res2/pct1, which are homologous to MBP1.
 - Schizosaccharomyces pombe start control protein cdc10.
 - Emericella   nidulans   (Aspergillus   nidulans)  cell  pattern  formation-
   associated protein    stuA.    It    regulates    the   transformation   of
   undifferentiated hyphal elements into a complex multicellular structure.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor PHD1.
 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  protein  SOK2.  It represses the transition from
   unicellular growth to pseudohyphae.
 - Candida albicans enhanced filamentous growth protein (EFG1).
 - Neurospora  crassa ascospore maturation 1 protein (Asm-1). It has a role in
   spore maturation.

The profile we developed covers the entire APSES domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
