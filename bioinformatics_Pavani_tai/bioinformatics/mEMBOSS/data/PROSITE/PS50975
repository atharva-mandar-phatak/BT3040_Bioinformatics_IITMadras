* ATP-grasp domain profile *
****************************

The  ATP-grasp superfamily currently includes 17 groups of enzymes, catalyzing
ATP-dependent  ligation  of  a  carboxylate containing molecule to an amino or
thiol   group-containing   molecule  [1].  They  contribute  predominantly  to
macromolecular  synthesis. ATP-hydrolysis is used to activate a substrate. For
example, DD-ligase transfers phosphate from ATP to D-alanine on the first step
of  catalysis. On the second step the resulting acylphosphate is attacked by a
second  D-alanine  to  produce  a DD dipeptide following phosphate elimination
[2].

The  ATP-grasp  domain  contains  three conserved motifs, corresponding to the
phosphate  binding  loop  and  the  Mg(2+)  binding  site  [3].  The  fold  is
characterized by two alpha-beta subdomains that grasp the ATP molecule between
them  (see  <PDB:1IOW>).  Each subdomain provides a variable loop that forms a
part  of  the  active site, completed by region of other domains not conserved
between the various ATP-grasp enzymes[4].

Proteins known to contain an ATP-grasp domain are listed below:

 - Biotin carboxylase (EC 6.3.4.14).
 - Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.5.5).
 - Cyanophycin synthetase (EC 6.-.-.-).
 - D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.4).
 - Urea amidolyase (Urea carboxylase) (EC 6.3.4.6).
 - Glutathione synthetase  (EC 6.3.2.3).
 - Lysine biosynthesis protein.
 - Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.4).
 - MurC/ddl bifunctional enzyme (EC 6.3.2.8).
 - Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.3).
 - Phosphoribosylamine--glycine ligase (EC 6.3.4.13).
 - Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.21).
 - Pyruvate carboxylase 1 (EC 6.4.1.1).
 - CAD protein, includes carbamoyl-phosphate synthase activity.
 - Ribosomal protein S6 modification protein.
 - Succinyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.5).
 - Vancomycin/teicoplanin resistance protein (EC 6.3.2.-).
 - 5-(carboxyamino)imidazole ribonucleotide synthase (EC 6.3.4.18).
 - Inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase (EC 2.7.1.134).
 - Inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (EC 2.7.1.159).
