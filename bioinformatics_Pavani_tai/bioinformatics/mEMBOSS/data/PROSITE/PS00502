* Polygalacturonase active site *
*********************************

Polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15)  (PG)  (pectinase) [1,2] catalyzes  the random
hydrolysis  of 1,4-alpha-D-galactosiduronic  linkages  in  pectate  and  other
galacturonans. In fruit,  polygalacturonase  plays  an  important role in cell
wall metabolism during ripening. In plant bacterial pathogens  such as Erwinia
carotovora or   Pseudomonas   solanacearum   and   fungal  pathogens  such  as
Aspergillus niger, polygalacturonase  is  involved  in  maceration  and  soft-
rotting of plant tissue.

Exo-poly-alpha-D-galacturonosidase (EC 3.2.1.82) (exoPG) [3] hydrolyzes peptic
acid from the non-reducing end, releasing digalacturonate.

Prokaryotic, eukaryotic   PG  and  exoPG  share  a  few  regions  of  sequence
similarity. We selected the best conserved of these regions, which is centered
on a  conserved  histidine  most  probably involved in the catalytic mechanism
[4].

-Consensus pattern: [GSDENKRH]-x(2)-[VMFC]-x(2)-[GS]-H-G-[LIVMAG]-x(1,2)-
                    [LIVM]-G-S
                    [H may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family 28  in  the  classification of glycosyl
 hydrolases [5,E1].
