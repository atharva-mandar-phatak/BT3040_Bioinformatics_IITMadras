* VPS9 domain profile *
***********************

Rab  proteins  form  a family of signal-transducing GTPases that cycle between
active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms. The Rab5 GTPase is an essential
regulator of endocytosis and endosome biogenesis. Rab5 is activated by GDP-GTP
exchange  factors  (GEFs) that contain a VPS9 domain and generate the Rab5-GTP
complex  [1].  The  VPS9  domain  catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Rab5 or the
yeast  homolog  VPS21.  The domain has a length of ~140 residues and forms the
central  part of the yeast VPS9 (vacuolar protein sorting-associated) protein,
which  acts  as  a  GEF for VPS21. Some domains which can occur in combination
with  the  VPS9  domain  are  CUE (see <PDOC51140>), A20-type zinc finger (see
<PDOC51036>),  Ras-associating  (RA) (see <PDOC50200>), SH2 (see <PDOC50001>),
RCC1  (see  <PDOC00544>),  DH  (see <PDOC00605>), PH (see <PDOC50003>), rasGAP
(see <PDOC00438>), MORN and ankyrin repeat (see <PDOC50088>).

Structurally,  the VPS9 domain adopts a layered fold of six alpha helices (see
<PDB:1TXU>).  Conserved  residues  from  the  fourth and sixth helices and the
loops  N-terminal  to  these helices form the surface that interacts with Rab5
and Rab21 [2].

Some proteins known to contain a VPS9 domain:

 - Fungal   Vacuolar   Protein  Sorting-associated  protein  VPS9,  a  guanine
   nucleotide  exchange  factor  for the Rab-like GTPase VPS21. VPS9 is needed
   for the transport of proteins from biosynthetic and endocytic pathways into
   the  vacuole.
 - Mammalian  Rab5  GDP/GTP  exchange factor or Rabex-5 (Rababtin-5 associated
   exchange  factor for Rab5), catalyzes nucleotide exchange on RAB5A. Rabex-5
   promotes  endocytic membrane fusion and is involved in membrane trafficking
   of recycling endosomes.
 - Mammalian Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), 2 (RIN2) and 3 (RIN3).
 - Mammalian   alsin  or  Amyotrophic  Lateral  Sclerosis  protein  2  (ALS2).
   Different  juvenile-onset  forms of neurodegenerative diseases (ALS2, JPLS,
   IAHSP)  are caused by mutations in the ALS2 gene, which result in truncated
   alsin lacking the C-terminal part of the VPS9 domain.
 - Fruit fly protein sprint, which is a RIN homologue.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans RME-6 protein, which is conserved among metazoans.

The profile we developed covers the entire VPS9 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
