* Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A hypusine signature *
******************************************************

Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) (formerly known as eIF-4D) [1,2] is a
small protein whose precise role in the initiation of protein synthesis is not
known. It appears to promote the formation of the first peptide bond.   eIF-5A
seems to be the  only  eukaryotic  protein  to  contain  an  hypusine residue.
Hypusine is  derived  from  lysine  by  the  post-translational  addition of a
butylamino group (from spermidine) to the epsilon-amino group of lysine.   The
hypusine group is essential to the function of eIF-5A.

A hypusine-containing  protein  has  been  found  in  archaebacteria  such  as
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius or Methanococcus jannaschii; this protein is  highly
similar to eIF-5A and could play a similar role in protein biosynthesis.

The signature we developed for eIF-5A is centered around the hypusine residue.
