* Aux/IAA-ARF dimerization domain profile *
*******************************************

Auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) regulates diverse cellular and developmental
responses  in  plants, including cell division, expansion, differentiation and
patterning  of embryos. It acts on the expression of many genes whose products
probably carry out developmental responses [1].

Two  related  families  of  proteins,  Aux/IAA proteins and the Auxin Response
Factors  (ARF)  are  key  regulators  of auxin-modulated gene expression. Both
proteins  function  as  transcriptional regulators [2,3]. ARF proteins bind to
auxin-responsive  cis-acting promoter element (AuxREs) using an amino terminal
DNA  binding  domain.  ARF  can  act  either as a transcriptional activator or
repressor  depending  on the sequence of the middle region of the protein [4].
Aux/IAA  proteins  are  thought  to  regulate  transcription  by modifying ARF
activity.  Both  family  of proteins share a common C-terminal protein-protein
interaction  domain.  This  domain  has  been  shown to mediate both homo- and
heterodimerization  between  members  of  ARF  and  Aux/IAA  proteins. Aux/IAA
proteins may affect ARF function by dimerizing with them [5].

The profile we developed covers the whole dimerization domain.
