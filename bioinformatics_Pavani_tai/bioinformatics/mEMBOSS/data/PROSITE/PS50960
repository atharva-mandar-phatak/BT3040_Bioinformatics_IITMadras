* Psq-type HTH domain profile *
*******************************

The  psq-type  HTH  domain  is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  50  amino acids present in eukaryotic proteins of the Pipsqueak family.
This  family  is  named  after  the Drosophila pipsqueak protein, containing a
DNA-binding  domain  that  consists  of  four tandem repeats of the psq motif.
Proteins of the Pipsqueak family occur in vertebrates, insects, nematodes, and
fungi. Three subgroups of the family have been described: BTB, E93 and CENP-B.
Pipsqueak  and  the other proteins of the BTB group (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack,
Bric   a   brac)   contain  a  BTB  protein-protein  interaction  domain  (see
<PDOC50097>)  in  the N-terminal part, and the psq-type HTH domain(s) occur in
the  C-terminal part. Many BTB proteins are transcriptional regulators and the
psq-type  HTH domain of e.g. pipsqueak and bric a brac proteins binds DNA. The
Drosophila cell death regulating protein E93 and e.g. human orthologs form the
second  subgroup  and  can  contain the psq-type HTH at varying positions. The
human  centromere protein B (CENP-B) and the other members of the CENP-B group
contain  a  psq-type  DNA-binding  domain  in  the N-terminal part and often a
dimerization  domain  in the C-terminal part. The CENP-B group includes fungal
transposases  that, however, lack the N-terminal extremity of the psq-type HTH
domain [1].

The  NMR  and crystal structures of human CENP-B show that the N-terminal part
of the DNA binding domain is composed of three alpha-helices (see <PDB:1HLV>).
The   second   and   third   helices   connected   via  a  turn  comprise  the
helix-turn-helix  motif.  Helix  3 is termed the recognition helix as it binds
the DNA major groove, like in other HTHs. In CENP-B this domain is followed by
a CENPB-type HTH, which binds an adjacent DNA major groove (see <PDOC51253>).

Some proteins known to contain a psq-type HTH domain:

 - Drosophila  pipsqueak  protein,  a developmental regulator with pleiotropic
   functions   during   oogenesis,   embryonic  pattern  formation  and  adult
   development. The psq-type HTH domain binds to GAGA sequences [2,3].
 - Drosophila  bric  a  brac 1 and 2 proteins, required for the development of
   adult ovaries, legs, antennae and abdomen.
 - Mammalian   centromere  protein  B,  associated  with  the  centromere  and
   specifically binding a 17 bp sequence, the CENP-B box.

The profile we developed covers the entire psq-type HTH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The majority of fungal  transposases lacks too many N-terminal residues
 in the domain and is therefore not detected by the profile.
