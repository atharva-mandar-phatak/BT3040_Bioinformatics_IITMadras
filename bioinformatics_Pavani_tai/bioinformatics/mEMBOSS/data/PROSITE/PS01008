* DnaA protein signature *
**************************

The bacterial  dnaA  protein [1,2,3] plays an important role in initiating and
regulating chromosomal  replication.  DnaA is an ATP- and DNA-binding protein.
It binds specifically to 9 bp nucleotide repeats known as dnaA boxes which are
found in the chromosome origin of replication (oriC).

DnaA is  a  protein  of  about  50 Kd that contains two conserved regions: the
first is  located  in  the  N-terminal half and corresponds to the ATP-binding
domain, the  second is located in the C-terminal half and could be involved in
DNA-binding. We  used  the  most  conserved  part  of the putative DNA-binding
domain as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [IL]-[GA]-x(2)-[LIVMF]-[SGADENK]-x(0,1)-[KR]-x-H-[STPA]-

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
