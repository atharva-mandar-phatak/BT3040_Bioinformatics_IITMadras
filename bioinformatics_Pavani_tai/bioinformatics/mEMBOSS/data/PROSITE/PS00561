* CBM2 (carbohydrate-binding type-2) domain signature and profile *
*******************************************************************

The  microbial  degradation  of cellulose and xylans requires several types of
enzyme  such  as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases),  or  xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1]. Structurally, cellulases and
xylanases  generally  consist  of a catalytic domain and a conserved region of
~100  amino acid residues, the carbohydrate-binding module 2 (CBM2) [2,E1]. It
is  found  either  at  the  N-terminal or at the C-terminal extremity of these
enzymes.

CBM2  can be classified in 2 subfamilies according to substrate specificities:
CBM2a which binds cellulose and CBM2b which interacts specifically with xylan.
CBM2a  and  CBM2b also display significant differences at the residue level as
shown in the following schematic representation:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.
'W': surface-exposed tryptophan

Like  other  CBM  domains CBM2 is a beta-sheet domain containing a planar face
which  interacts  with its ligand via a hydrophobic strip of aromatic residues
(see  <PDB:1EXG>) [3]. In family 2a this hydrophobic surface consists of three
tryptophan  residues, which are all required for binding soluble and insoluble
forms  of  cellulose  [4]. In family 2b only 2 surface-exposed tryptophans are
conserved  and the first one is oriented differently. It is therefore not well
oriented to interact with cellulose but is ideal for binding xylan [5].

Enzymes known to contain such a domain are:

 - Endoglucanase (gene end1) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
 - Endoglucanases A (gene cenA) and B (cenB) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Exoglucanases A (gene cbhA) and B (cbhB) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Endoglucanase E-2 (gene celB) from Thermomonospora fusca.
 - Endoglucanase A (gene celA) from Microbispora bispora.
 - Endoglucanases A  (gene celA),  B (celB)  and  C  (celC)  from  Pseudomonas
   fluorescens.
 - Endoglucanase A (gene celA) from Streptomyces lividans.
 - Exocellobiohydrolase (gene cex) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Xylanases A (gene xynA) and B (xynB) from Pseudomonas fluorescens.
 - Arabinofuranosidase C   (EC 3.2.1.55)    (xylanase C)    (gene xynC)   from
   Pseudomonas fluorescens.
 - Chitinase 63 (EC 3.2.1.14) from Streptomyces plicatus.
 - Chitinase C from Streptomyces lividans.

To  recognize  the  CBM2a  domain we developed a pattern which is located in a
conserved  region  specific to CBM2a. We also developed a profile which covers
the whole CBM2 domain and recognizes both CBM2 subfamilies.
