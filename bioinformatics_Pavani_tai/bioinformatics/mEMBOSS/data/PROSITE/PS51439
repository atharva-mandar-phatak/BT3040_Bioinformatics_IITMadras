*************************
* MENTAL domain profile *
*************************

The following  proteins  share  a conserved region called the MENTAL (MLN64 N-
terminal) domain  composed  of  four  transmembrane  helices  with three short
intervening loops [1,2,3]:

 - Animal  MLN64 (metastatic lymph node 64), a late endosomal membrane protein
   containing a   carboxyl-terminal  cholesterol  binding  START  domain  (see
   <PDOC50848>). It   is   probably   involved  in  intracellular  cholesterol
   transport.
 - Mammalian  MENTHO  (MLN64  N-terminal  domain  homologue), a late endosomal
   protein containing  only  the  MENTAL  domain.  It  is probably involved in
   cellular cholesterol homoeostasis.

The ~170-amino  acid MENTAL domain mediates MLN64 and MENTHO homo- and hetero-
interactions, targets  both  proteins to late endosomes and binds cholesterol.
The MENTAL  domain might serve to maintain cholesterol at the membrane of late
endosomes prior  to  its  shuttle to cytoplasmic acceptor(s) through the START
domain.

The profile we developed covers the entire MENTAL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
