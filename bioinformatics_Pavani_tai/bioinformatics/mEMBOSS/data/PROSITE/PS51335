***********************
* ELMO domain profile *
***********************

Regulatory GTPases  in  the  Ras superfamily employ a cycle of alternating GTP
binding and  hydrolysis, controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and
GTPase-activating proteins  (GAPs),  as essential features of their actions in
cells. Within  the  Ras superfamily, the Arf family is composed of 30 members,
including 22  Arf-like  (Arl)  proteins.  The  ELMO  (for  EnguLfment and cell
MOtility) domain  has  been  proposed  to  be  a GAP domain for ARL2 and other
members of the Arf family [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire ELMO domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 2007 / First entry.
