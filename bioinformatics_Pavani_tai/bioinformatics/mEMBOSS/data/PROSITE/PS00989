* Clathrin adaptor complexes small chain signature *
****************************************************

Clathrin coated  vesicles (CCV) mediate intracellular membrane traffic such as
receptor mediated  endocytosis.  In addition to clathrin, the CCV are composed
of a number of other components including oligomeric complexes which are known
as adaptor  or  clathrin  assembly  proteins  (AP)  complexes [1]. The adaptor
complexes are  believed  to  interact  with  the cytoplasmic tails of membrane
proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. In mammals two type of
adaptor complexes  are  known: AP-1 which is associated with the Golgi complex
and AP-2  which is associated with the plasma membrane. Both AP-1 and AP-2 are
heterotetramers that  consist  of two large chains - the adaptins - (gamma and
beta' in  AP-1; alpha and beta in AP-2); a medium chain (AP47 in AP-1; AP50 in
AP-2) and a small chain (AP19 in AP-1; AP17 in AP-2).

The small  chains  of AP-1 and AP-2 are evolutionary related proteins of about
18 Kd.   Homologs  of AP17 and AP19 have also been found in yeast (genes APS1/
YAP19 and  APS2/YAP17)  [2,3,4].   AP17 and AP19 are also related to the zeta-
chain [5] of coatomer (zeta-cop),  a cytosolic protein complex that reversibly
associates with Golgi  membranes  to  form vesicles that  mediate biosynthetic
protein transport  from    the  endoplasmic reticulum, via the Golgi up to the
trans Golgi network.

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in the central section
of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMC]-[LIVM]-Y-[KR]-x(4)-L-Y-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 fungal zeta-cop.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
