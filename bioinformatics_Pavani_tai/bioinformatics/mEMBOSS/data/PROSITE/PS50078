***************************
* POLO box domain profile *
***************************

A  subgroup  of  serine/threonine  protein  kinases (see  <PDOC00100>) playing
multiple  role  during  cell  cycle,  especially  in  M  phase progression and
cytokinesis,  contain  a  duplicated domain in their C-terminal part, the POLO
box  [1].  It is  named  after its founding member encoded by the polo gene of
Drosophila [2]. This domain of around 70 amino acids has been found in species
ranging from yeast to mammals.

Point mutations in  the POLO box of the budding yeast CDC5 protein abolish the
ability of  overexpressed  CDC5  to  interact  with  the  spindle poles and to
organize cytokinetic structures [3].

Some of the proteins that contain a POLO box are listed below:

 - Mammalian  serine/threonine-protein  kinase  SNK.  May  play  a role in the
   division of   cell  types,  such  as  fibroblasts  and  could  function  in
   embryogenesis.
 - Mammmalian  serine/threonine-protein  kinase  PLK. PLK is required for cell
   division with a role during G1 or S phase.
 - Drosophila  protein kinase Polo. May play a role in regulating both nuclear
   and cytoplasmic aspects of the mitotic cycle.
 - Fission  yeast  serine/threonine-protein  kinase  PLO1.  Required to form a
   bipolar spindle,  the actin ring and septum.
 - Yeast cell cycle protein kinase CDC5/MSD2. Protein kinase required for cell
   cycle progression.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
