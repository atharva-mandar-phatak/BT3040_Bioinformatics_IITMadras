* IQ motif profile *
********************

The IQ motif  is  an  extremely  basic  unit  of  about 23 amino acids,  whose
conserved core usually fits the consensus A-x(3)-I-Q-x(2)-F-R-x(4)-K-K. The IQ
motif, which  can  be  present in one or more copies, serves as a binding site
for different  EF-hand proteins (see <PDOC00018>) including the  essential and
regulatory myosin light chains, calmodulin (CaM), and CaM-like proteins [1,2].
Many IQ motis are protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites [3,4].

Resolution  of the 3D structure of scallop myosin has shown that the IQ motif
forms a basic amphipathic helix [5].

Some proteins known to contain an IQ motif are listed below:

 - A number of conventional and unconventional myosins.
 - Neuromodulin  (GAP-43)  (see  <PDOC00344>). This protein is associated with
   nerve growth.    It  is a major component of the motile "growth cones" that
   form the tips of elongating axons.
 - Neurogranin  (NG/p17).  Acts  as  a  "third messenger" substrate of protein
   kinase C-mediated   molecular  cascades  during  synaptic  development  and
   remodeling.
 - Sperm surface protein Sp17.
 - Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1. IQGAP1 contains 4 IQ motifs.

The profile we developed covers the entire IQ motif.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
