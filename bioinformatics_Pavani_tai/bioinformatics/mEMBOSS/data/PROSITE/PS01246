* Uncharacterized protein family UPF0003 signature *
****************************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Escherichia coli protein aefA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yggB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjeP and HI0195.1, the  corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ynaI.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yhdY.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0415.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0639.
 - Archaeoglobus fulgidus hypothetical protein AF1546.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0170.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ1143.

The  size of these proteins range from 30 to 120 Kd. They all contain a number
of transmembrane  regions.  As  a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  the best
conserved region  which  is  located  in  and  just  after  the last potential
transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: G-[STIF]-V-x(2)-[LIVM]-x(6)-[LIVMF]-x(3)-[DQT]-x(3)-
                    [LIVH]-x-[LIV]-P-[NW]-x(2)-[LIVMF]-[LIVFSTA]-x(5)-[NV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
