* Dps protein family signatures *
*********************************

Escherichia coli protein dps [1] is a DNA-binding protein, synthesized  during
prolonged starvation,  that  seems  to  protect DNA from oxidative damage. Dps
binds DNA without any apparent sequence specificity. It  is a protein of about
19 Kd  that  associates  into a complex  of 12 subunits  forming  two  stacked
hexameric rings.

Proteins similar to dps have been found in other bacteria:

 - Bacillus subtilis protein mrgA.
 - Antigen TpF1/TyF1 from Treponema pallidum and pertenue.
 - Haemophilus ducreyi fine tangled pili major subunit (gene ftpA).
 - Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A (gene napA).
 - Listeria innocua non-heme iron-containing ferritin.
 - Synechococcus  PCC  7942  nutrient-stress induced DNA binding protein (gene
   dpsA).
 - A low-temperature induced protein from Anabaena variabilis.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1349.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1894.
 - A hypothetical protein  encoded  in  the 5' region of a  gene coding  for a
   bromoperoxidase, in plasmid pOP2621 of Streptomyces aureofaciens.

All these proteins  share  a conserved  region of  about 50 residues in  their
central region.  We  have  developed  two signature patterns derived from both
extremities of that region.

-Consensus pattern: H-[FW]-x-[LIVM]-x-G-x(5)-[LV]-H-x(3)-[DE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY]-[DH]-x-[LIVM]-[GA]-E-R-x(3)-[LIF]-[GDN]-x(2)-[PA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: There  seems [2] to be a structural similarity between this family  and
 that of eukaryotic ferritins (see <PDOC00181>).

-Last update: July 1998 / Patterns and text revised.
