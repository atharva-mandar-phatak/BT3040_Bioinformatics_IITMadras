* Ribosomal protein L3 signature *
**********************************

Ribosomal protein  L3 is one of the proteins from the large ribosomal subunit.
In Escherichia  coli,  L3 is known to bind to the 23S rRNA and may participate
in the formation of the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome. It belongs
to a   family  of    ribosomal  proteins  which,  on  the  basis  of  sequence
similarities [1,2,3,4], groups:

 - Eubacterial L3.
 - Red algal L3.
 - Cyanelle L3.
 - Archaebacterial Halobacterium marismortui HmaL3 (HL1).
 - Yeast L3 (also known as trichodermin resistance protein) (gene TCM1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana L3 (genes ARP1 and ARP2).
 - Mammalian L3 (L4).
 - Mammalian mitochondrial L3.
 - Yeast mitochondrial YmL9 (gene MRPL9).

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region located in the central
section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [FL]-x(6)-[DN]-x(2)-[AGS]-x-[ST]-x-G-[KRH]-G-x(2)-G-x(3)-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
