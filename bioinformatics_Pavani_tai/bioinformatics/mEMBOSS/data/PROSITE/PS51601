* Class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
************************************************************

Methyltransferases  (EC  2.1.1.-)  constitute  an  important  class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy)  and  a  methylated  molecule.  The substrates that are methylated by
these  enzymes  cover  virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules,  to  lipids,  proteins  and  nucleic  acids. Methyltransferases are
therefore   involved   in   many   essential   cellular   processes  including
biosynthesis,  signal  transduction,  protein repair, chromatin regulation and
gene  silencing  [1,2,3].  More  than  230  different  enzymatic  reactions of
methyltransferases  have been described so far, of which more than 220 use SAM
as  the  methyl  donor  [E1].  A  review  published  in  2003  [2] divides all
methyltransferases  into  5  classes based on the structure of their catalytic
domain (fold):
 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta     see <PDOC51604>
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta       see <PDOC51565>
A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:
 - class VI:   transmembrane                    all alpha      see <PDOC51598>
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

The  vast  majority  of  methyltransferases  belong  to the Rossmann-like fold
(Class  I)  which  consists  in  a seven-stranded beta sheet adjoined by alpha
helices.  The beta sheet contains a central topological switch-point resulting
in  a  deep  cleft  in which SAM binds. Class I methyltransferases display two
conserved  positions, the first one is a GxGxG motif (or at least a GxG motif)
at   the   end  of  the  first  beta  strand  which  is  characteristic  of  a
nucleotide-binding  site  and  is hence used to bind the adenosyl part of SAM,
the  second  conserved  position is an acidic residue at the end of the second
beta  strand  that  forms one hydrogen bond to each hydroxyl of the SAM ribose
part. The core of these enzymes is composed by about 150 amino acids that show
very strong spatial conservation. Catechol O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.6) is
the  canonical  Class  I methyltransferase considering that it consists in the
exact consensus structural core with no extra domain (see <PDB:1VID>) [2].
