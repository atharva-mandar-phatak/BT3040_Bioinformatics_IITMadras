* HD Cas3-type domain profile *
*******************************

Clustered regularly  interspaced  short  palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and Cas
proteins represents  an  adaptative  microbial immunity system against viruses
and plasmids.  Cas3  proteins  have  been  proposed  to play a key role in the
CRISPR mechanism  through  the direct cleavage of invasive nucleic acids. Cas3
proteins are  predicted  to  contain the DExD/H-box helicase (see <PDOC51192>)
and HD  domains, which can be covalently fused (Cas3) or encoded as individual
proteins (Cas3'  or  Cas3'', respectively). The HD domain proteins represent a
large group    of    enzymes,    which    catalyze    phosphomonoesterase   or
phosphodiesterase reactions   on   a   broad  range  of  substrates  including
nucleotides and   nucleic   acids  and  function  primarily  in  nucleic  acid
metabolism and  signal  transduction.  The  Cas3-type  HD  domain has nuclease
activity against ssDNA and ssRNA [1,2].

The globular  Cas3-type  HD  domain is composed of eigth alpha-helices and two
short beta-strands connected by extended loops (see <PDB:3S4L>) [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire Cas3-type HD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
