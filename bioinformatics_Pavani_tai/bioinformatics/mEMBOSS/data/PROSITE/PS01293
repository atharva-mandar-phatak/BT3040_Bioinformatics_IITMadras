* Nudix hydrolase domain signatures and profile *
*************************************************

The Nudix  superfamily  is  widespread among eucaryotes, bacteria, archaea and
viruses and  consists mainly of pyrophosphohydrolases that act upon substrates
of general  structure  NUcleoside  DIphosphate  linked  to  another  moiety, X
(NDP-X) to yield NMP plus P-X. Such substrates include (d)NTPs (both canonical
and oxidised   derivatives),  nucleotide  sugars  and  alcohols,  dinucleoside
polyphosphates (NpnN),   dinucleotide  coenzymes  and  capped  RNAs.  However,
phosphohydrolase activity,  including  activity  towards  NDPs themselves, and
non-nucleotide substrates  such  as  diphosphoinositol  polyphosphates (DIPs),
5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate  (PRPP),  thiamine  pyrophosphate  (TPP)  and
dihydroneopterin triphosphate   (DHNTP)   have   also   been  described.  Some
superfamily members,  such  as  Escherichia  coli  mutT,  have  the ability to
degrade potentially  mutagenic,  oxidised nucleotides while others control the
levels of metabolic intermediates and signalling compounds. In procaryotes and
simple eucaryotes,  the  number  of  Nudix  genes  varies  from  0 to over 30,
reflecting the  metabolic  complexity  and adaptability of the organism. Nudix
hydrolases are typically small proteins, larger ones having additional domains
with interactive or other catalytic functions [1].

The Nudix  domain  formed by two beta-sheets packed between alpha-helices (see
<PDB:1G0S; A>)  [2,3]. It can accomodate sequences of different lengths in the
connecting loops  and in the amtiparallel beta-sheet. Catalysis depends on the
conserved 23-amino  acid  Nudix  motif  (Nudix box), G-x(5)-E-x(5)-[UA]-x-R-E-
x(2)-E-E-x-G-U, where U is an aliphatic, hydrophobic residue. This sequence is
located in a loop-helix-loop structural motif and the Glu residues in the core
of the  motif,  R-E-x(2)-E-E,  play  an  important  role  in binding essential
divalent cations  [1].  The  substrate  specificity  is  determined   by other
residues outside  the  Nudix  box. For example, CoA pyrophosphatases share the
NuCoA motif   L-L-T-x-R-[SA]-x(3)-R-x(3)-G-x(3)-F-P-G-G  that  is  located  N-
terminal of the Nudix box and is involved in CoA recognition [4].

Some proteins known to contain a Nudix domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial  mutator  mutT  protein (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase)
   (8-oxo-dGTPase) (3.6.1.-) (dGTP pyrophosphohydrolase).
 - Streptomyces pneumoniae mutX.
 - Escherichia  coli nudB (ntpA) dihydroneopterin triphosphate pyrophosphatase
   (EC 3.6.1.-) (dATP pyrophosphohydrolase).

   pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.22).
 - Escherichia coli nudE (yrfE) ADP compounds hydrolase (EC 3.6.1.-).
 - Bacterial nudH (rppH) RNA pyrophosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.-) ((Di)nucleoside

   hydrolase (Ap4Aase) (EC 3.6.1.17) [5], which cleaves A-5'-PPPP-5'A to yield
   AMP and ATP.

 - Poxviruses proteins D9 and D10.

We developed two patterns for the Nudix domain. The first one covers the Nudix
box and  the  second the NuCoA motif. We also developed a profile which covers
the entire Nudix domain.
