* Protein secE/sec61-gamma signature *
**************************************

In bacteria, the secE protein plays a role in protein export; it is one of the
components -  with  secY  (see  <PDOC00612>)  and  secA  -  of the  preprotein
translocase. In eukaryotes, the evolutionary related protein sec61-gamma plays
a role  in protein translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum; it is part
of a trimeric complex that also consist of sec61-alpha and beta [1]. Both secE
and sec61-gamma  are small proteins of about 60 to 90 amino acids that contain
a single  transmembrane region at their C-terminal extremity (Escherichia coli
secE is  an exception,  in  that  it possess an extra N-terminal segment of 60
residues that contains two additional transmembrane domains).

The sequence  of  secE/sec61-gamma is not extremely well conserved, however it
is possible  to  derive  a  signature  pattern centered on a conserved proline
located 10 residues before the beginning of the transmembrane domain.
