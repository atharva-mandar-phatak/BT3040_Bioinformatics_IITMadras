* Autotransporter beta-domain profile *
***************************************

Among  the  pathways  that  Gram-negative  bacteria  have  evolved  to secrete
proteins  to  the surface or the extracellular milieu, autotransporter protein
secretion  pathway  (type  Va,  AT-1  or  TC  1.B.12),  is one of the simplest
secretion  mechanisms,  and  is  widely  distributed, especially in pathogenic
bacteria  [1,2,3,E1].  As implied by their name, autotransporter (AT) proteins
contain  all  the  necessary  determinants  for translocation across the outer
membrane   within  their  own  polypeptide.  They  have  a  modular  structure
consisting  of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a "passenger" domain,
and  by a C-terminal module called the "translocation unit", which consists of
a  short  linker  region  with  an  alpha-helical  secondary  structure  and a
beta-domain of 250 to 300 amino acid residues [2,3].

Such a structure is shown in the following schematic representation:

                                                +-- translocation unit --+
                                                |                        |
  +--+------------------------------------------+-------+----------------+
  |SP|            passenger domain              |linker |  beta-domain   |
  +--+------------------------------------------+-------+----------------+

  'SP': signal peptide;

While  the  translocation  units  of  ATs are highly homologous, the passenger
domains  are  very  diverse. To date, all characterized passenger domains have
been  implicated  in  virulence  by  displaying  enzymatic activity (protease,
peptidase,  lipase and esterase); mediating actin-promoted bacterial motility;
acting   as   adhesins,   immunomodulatory  proteins,  toxins  or  cytotoxins,
permitting the maturation of other virulence proteins. ATs are present only in
the  eubacteria  and  are  most prevalent in Proteobacteria, including alpha-,
beta-, gamma-, and epsilon-Proteobacteria classes [2].

At  the  cell  surface,  the  precursors  of  many  AT  proteins may undergo a
proteolytic  cleavage  in  the  course  of  secretion,  which results in their
separation  into  two  polypeptides, the beta-domain in the outer membrane and
the  passenger protein exposed at the surface or released into the milieu. The
cleavage  is  mediated by the integral serine protease active sites of the AT,
present  in  the  passenger  domain  or  by  a  variety  of proteases. But the
passenger  domain  is  not necessarily cleaved and may also remain intact as a
large protein with a membrane-bound C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain
extending into the external milieu [2,3].

One  model  for  AT secretion suggests that following the Sec-dependent export
across  the inner membrane, the beta-domain inserts into the outer membrane in
an  anti-parallel  beta-barrel  structure  that  forms  a  pore,  in the outer
membrane,  through which the passenger domain is translocated to the bacterial
surface  in  an unfolded form [2,3].

The  3D  structure  of  translocation unit of NalP from Neisseria meningitides
reveals  a 12-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel with a hydrophilic pore of 10
X  12.5  angstroms  (see <PDB:1UYN>) [4], which is consistent with this model.
However,  it  has  been  reported  that  the  purified C-terminal part of IgA1
protease  from  Neisseria  gonorroheae  forms  an oligomeric ring-like complex
containing  a  central  hydrophilic  channel  from  which the folded passenger
domains  with  a  diameter  of ~2 nm are secreted [5]. Recently an alternative
model  was  proposed  in which the passenger domain is secreted through a pore
formed  by  the  omp85  complex,  a component of the general machinery for the
assembly  of  outer  membrane  proteins,  rather  than  through  a pore by the
translocation unit [4].
