* BSD domain profile *
**********************

The BSD  domain  is  an about 60-residue long domain named after the BTF2-like
transcription factors,  Synapse-associated  proteins and DOS2-like proteins in
which it  is  found.  Additionally,  it  is also found in several hypothetical
proteins. The  BSD  domain occurs in one or two copies in a variety of species
ranging from  primal protozoan to human. It can be found associated with other
domains such  as  the BTB domain (see <PDOC50097>) or the U-box in multidomain
proteins. The function of the BSD domain is yet unknown [1].

Secondary structure prediction indicates the presence of three predicted alpha
helices, which  probably  form  a  three-helical  bundle in small domains. The
third predicted   helix  contains  neighboring  phenylalanine  and  tryptophan
residues -  less  common amino acids that are invariant in all the BSD domains
identified and that are the most striking sequence features of the domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain one or two BSD domains are listed below:

 - Mammalian TFIIH basal transcription factor complex p62 subunit (GTF2H1).
 - Yeast  RNA  polymerase II transcription factor B 73 kDa subunit (TFB1), the
   homologue of BTF2.
 - Yeast  DOS2  protein.  It  is  involved  in single-copy DNA replication and
   ubiquitination.
 - Drosophila synapse-associated protein SAP47.
 - Mammalian SYAP1.
 - Various Arabidopsis thaliana hypothetical proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire BSD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
