* RNA polymerases N / 8 Kd subunits signature *
***********************************************

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing  different sets of genes. Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

Archaebacterial subunit N (gene rpoN) [1] is a small protein of about 8 Kd, it
is evolutionary related [2] to a 8.3 Kd component shared by all three forms of
eukaryotic RNA polymerases (gene RPB10 in yeast and POLR2J in mammals) as well
as to African swine fever virus protein CP80R [3].

As a signature pattern we selected a conserved  region which is located at the
N-terminal extremity  of  these  polymerase subunits; this region contains two
cysteines that binds a zinc ion [4].

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFD]-[LIVMFP]-P-[LIVM]-x-C-[FL]-[ST]-C-G
                    [The 2 C's are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
