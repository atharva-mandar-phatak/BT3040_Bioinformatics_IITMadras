* WH2 domain profile *
**********************

The  WH2  (WASP-Homology  2,  or  Wiskott-Aldrich homology 2) domain is an ~18
amino  acids  actin-binding  motif.  This  domain  was  first recognized as an
essential  element  for  the  regulation  of the cytoskeleton by the mammalian
Wiskott-Aldrich   syndrome  protein  (WASP)  family.  WH2  proteins  occur  in
eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, in insect viruses, and in some bacteria. The
WH2 domain is found as a modular part of larger proteins; it can be associated
with  the  WH1  or EVH1 domain (see <PDOC50229>) and with the CRIB domain (see
<PDOC50108>),  and the WH2 domain can occur as a tandem repeat. The WH2 domain
binds  actin  monomers  and can facilitate the assembly of actin monomers into
newly forming actin filaments [1-4].

Some proteins known to contain a WH2 domain:

 - Mammalian  Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a possible regulator of
   lymphocyte and platelet function. Defects in WASP are the cause of Wiskott-
   Aldrich  syndrome  (WAS),  an  X-linked  recessive disease characterized by
   immune  dysregulation  and  microthrombocytopenia.  WASP  proteins bind the
   actin nucleating protein complex Arp2/3.
 - Mammalian  N-WASP/WASL  and  WASF/SCAR/WAVE1-3,  and yeast LAS17, which are
   also  proteins from the WASP family that participate in the transduction of
   signals from the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton.
 - Baker's  yeast  Verprolin,  a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization
   and cellular growth.
 - Human  WASP  interacting  protein  (WASPIP/WIP),  a  WASP-,  profilin-  and
   actin-binding    protein    which    induces   actin   polymerization   and
   redistribution.
 - Nuclear  polyhedrosis  virus  (NPV)  P61/78/83 capsid protein, which may be
   important for the persistence and survival of the virus.
 - Fruit  fly  Spir(e)  protein,  an  actin  nucleation factor involved in the
   development of oocytes and embryos. Spir is conserved among metazoans.
 - Mammalian  metastasis  suppressor 1 or Missing in Metastasis (MIM) protein,
   an actin-binding protein that may be related to cancer progression or tumor
   metastasis.
