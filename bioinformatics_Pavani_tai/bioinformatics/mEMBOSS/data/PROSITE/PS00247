* HBGF/FGF family signature *
*****************************

Heparin-binding growth factors I and II (HBGF) [1,2] (also known as acidic and
basic fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are  structurally related mitogens which
stimulate growth or differentiation of a wide  variety  of cells of mesodermal
or neuroectodermal origin.  These  two  proteins  belong to a family of growth
factors and oncogenes which is currently known [3,4] to include:

 - FGF-3  (int-2),  induced  by  the  integration of mouse mammary tumor virus
   (MMTV).
 - FGF-4  (hst-1;  KS3),  a transforming protein independently isolated from a
   human stomach tumor (hst-1) and from Kaposi's sarcoma (KS3).
 - FGF-5, an oncogene expressed in neonatal brain.
 - FGF-6  (hst-2),  a  transforming protein that exhibits strong mitogenic and
   angiogenic properties.
 - FGF-7  or  keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a paracrine effector of normal
   epithelial cell proliferation.
 - FGF-8 or androgen-induced growth factor (AIGF).
 - FGF-9 or glia-activating factor (GAF), a heparin-binding growth factor that
   may have   a   role   in  glial  cell  growth  and  differentiation  during
   development.
 - FGF-11  (FHF-3),  FGF-12  (FHF-1),  FGF-13  (FHF-2) and FGF-14 (FHF-4) [5],
   which seem to be involved in nervous system development and function.
 - FGF-15,  which  may  play an important role in regulating cell division and
   patterning within  specific regions of the embryonic brain, spinal cord and
   sensory organs.
 - FGF-16.
 - FGF-17.
 - FGF-18, which stimulates hepatic and intestinal proliferation.
 - FGF-19,
 - A  FGF  homolog  of  unknown  function  from Autographa californica nuclear
   polyhedrosis virus [6].

From  the sequences  of these  related proteins, we  have  derived a signature
pattern which includes one of the two conserved cysteine residues.

-Consensus pattern: G-x-[LIM]-x-[STAGP]-x(6,7)-[DENA]-C-x-[FLM]-x-[EQ]-x(6)-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
