* Zinc carboxypeptidases, zinc-binding regions signatures *
***********************************************************

There are a number of  different types of zinc-dependent carboxypeptidases (EC
3.4.17.-) [1,2].   All these enzymes seem  to be structurally and functionally
related. The enzymes that belong to this family are listed below.

 - Carboxypeptidase A1 (EC 3.4.17.1), a pancreatic  digestive  enzyme that can
   removes all C-terminal amino acids with the exception of Arg, Lys and Pro.
 - Carboxypeptidase A2 (EC 3.4.17.15), a  pancreatic digestive  enzyme  with a
   specificity similar to that of  carboxypeptidase A1,  but with a preference
   for bulkier C-terminal residues.
 - Carboxypeptidase B (EC 3.4.17.2), also a  pancreatic  digestive enzyme, but
   that preferentially removes C-terminal Arg and Lys.
 - Carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.17.3) (also known as arginine carboxypeptidase),
   a plasma  enzyme   which  protects  the body  from  potent  vasoactive  and
   inflammatory  peptides  containing C-terminal Arg or Lys (such as kinins or
   anaphylatoxins) which are released into the circulation.
 - Carboxypeptidase H (EC 3.4.17.10) (also known as  enkephalin  convertase or
   carboxypeptidase E), an enzyme located in  secretory granules of pancreatic
   islets, adrenal gland, pituitary and brain. This enzyme removes residual C-
   terminal Arg or Lys  remaining  after  initial endoprotease cleavage during
   prohormone processing.
 - Carboxypeptidase M (EC 3.4.17.12),  a  membrane  bound Arg and Lys specific
   enzyme.
   It is ideally situated to  act  on  peptide  hormones at local tissue sites
   where it could control  their  activity  before  or  after interaction with
   specific plasma membrane receptors.
 - Mast cell carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.17.1),  an  enzyme  with  a  specificity
   to carboxypeptidase A, but  found in the secretory  granules of mast cells.
 - Streptomyces griseus  carboxypeptidase (Cpase SG)  (EC 3.4.17.-) [3], which
   combines the specificities of mammalian carboxypeptidases A and B.
 - Thermoactinomyces  vulgaris  carboxypeptidase T  (EC 3.4.17.18) (CPT)  [4],
   which also combines the specificities of carboxypeptidases A and B.
 - AEBP1 [5], a transcriptional repressor active in preadipocytes. AEBP1 seems
   to regulate transcription by cleavage of other transcriptional proteins.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR132c.

All of  these  enzymes  bind  an  atom of zinc.  Three  conserved residues are
implicated in the binding of the zinc atom: two histidines and a glutamic acid
We have derived two signature patterns which contain these three zinc-ligands.

-Consensus pattern: [PK]-x-[LIVMFY]-x-[LIVMFY]-x(2)-{E}-x-H-[STAG]-x-E-x-
                    [LIVM]-[STAG]-{L}-x(5)-[LIVMFYTA]
                    [H and E are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: Bacillus sphaericus endopeptidase I
 which hydrolyses  the  gamma-D-Glu-(L)meso-diaminopimelic  acid bond of spore
 cortex peptidoglycan  [6]  and  which  is  possibly distantly related to zinc
 carboxypeptidases.

-Consensus pattern: H-[STAG]-{ADNV}-{VGFI}-{YAR}-[LIVME]-{SDEP}-x-[LIVMFYW]-P-
                    [FYW]
                    [H is a zinc ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 52.

-Note: If a protein includes  both signatures, the  probability of  it being a
 eukaryotic zinc carboxypeptidase is 100%
-Note: These  proteins  belong  to families M14A/M14B in the classification of
 peptidases [7,E1].

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
