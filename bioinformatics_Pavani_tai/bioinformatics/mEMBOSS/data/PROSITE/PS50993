* Nidogen G2 beta-barrel domain profile *
*****************************************

Basement membranes  are  sheet-like  extracellular matrices found at the basal
surfaces of  epithelia and condensed mesenchyma. By preventing cell mixing and
providing a  cell-adhesive  substrate,  they  play  crucial  roles  in  tissue
development and function. Basement menbranes are composed of an evolutionarily
ancient set  of  large  glycoproteins,  which  includes members of the laminin
family, collagen  IV,  perlecan  and  nidogen/entactin. Nidogen/entactin is an
important basement   membrane   component,  which  promotes  cell  attachment,
neutrophil chemotaxis, trophoblast outgrowth, and angiogenesis. It consists of
three globular  regions,  G1-G3.  G1  and  G2  are  connected by a thread-like
structure, whereas that between G2 and G3 is rod-like [1,2].

The nidogen  G2  region  binds  to  collagen  IV  and perlecan. The nidogen G2
structure is  composed  of  two  domains,  an  N-terminal EGF-like domain (see
<PDOC00021>) and  a  much  larger  beta-barrel  domain  of  ~230 residues (see
<PDB:1H4U>). The nidogen G2 beta-barrel consists of an 11-stranded beta-barrel
of complex  topology,  the  interior of which is traversed by the hydrophobic,
predominantly alpha helical segment connecting strands C and D. The N-terminal
half of the barrel comprises two beta-meanders (strands A-C and D-F) linked by
the buried  alpha-helical  segment.  The  polypeptide  chain  then crosses the
bottom of  the  barrel  and  forms  a  five-stranded Greek key motif in the C-
terminal half of the domain. Helix alpha3 caps the top of the barrel and forms
the interface  to  the  EGF-like domain. The nidogen G2 beta-barrel domain has
unexpected structural similarity to green fluorescent protein, suggesting that
they derive  from  a  common  ancestor.  A  large  surface patch on the barrel
surface is  strikingly  conserved  in  all  metazoan  nidogens.  Site-directed
mutagenesis demonstrates  that  the  conserved residues in the conserved patch
are involved in the binding of perlecan, and possibly also of collagen IV [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire nidogen G2 beta-barrel domain.
