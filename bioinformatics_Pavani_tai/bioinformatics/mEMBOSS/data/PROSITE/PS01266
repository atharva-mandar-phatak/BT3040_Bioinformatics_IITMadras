* Adenylosuccinate synthetase signatures *
******************************************

Adenylosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.4) [1] plays an important role in purine
biosynthesis, by catalyzing   the GTP-dependent conversion of IMP and aspartic
acid to AMP.   Adenylosuccinate synthetase has been characterized from various
sources  ranging from  Escherichia coli (gene purA) to vertebrate tissues.  In
vertebrates, two  isozymes  are  present - one involved in purine biosynthesis
and the other in the purine nucleotide cycle.

As signature  patterns,  we  selected  two conserved regions. The first one is
a perfectly conserved octapeptide located in the  N-terminal section and which
is involved in GTP-binding [2]. The second one includes a lysine residue known
[2] to be essential for the enzyme's activity.

-Consensus pattern: [QGF]-[WLCF]-G-D-E-[GA]-K-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: G-I-[GR]-P-x-Y-x(2)-K-x(2)-R
                    [K is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for archebacterial purA [3].
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
