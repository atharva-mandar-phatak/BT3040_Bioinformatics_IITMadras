* Electron transfer flavoprotein beta-subunit signature *
*********************************************************

The electron  transfer flavoprotein (ETF) [1,2] serves as a  specific electron
acceptor for various mitochondrial dehydrogenases.  ETF transfers electrons to
the  main  respiratory chain  via  ETF-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase.  ETF  is an
heterodimer that consist of  an  alpha  and  a beta subunit and which bind one
molecule of FAD per dimer. A similar system also exists in some bacteria.

The beta  subunit  of  ETF  is  a protein of about 28 Kd which is structurally
related to  the  bacterial  nitrogen  fixation protein fixA which could play a
role in a redox process and feed electrons to ferredoxin.

Other related proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydiQ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygcR.

As  a signature  pattern  for these  proteins, we  selected a conserved region
which is located in the central section.

-Consensus pattern: [IVAG]-x-[KR]-x(2)-[DE]-[GDE](2)-x(1,2)-[EQHF]-x-[LIV]-
                    x(4)-P-x-[LIVM](2)-[TACS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ygcR.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
