* Bromodomain signature and profile *
*************************************

The bromodomain [1,2,3] is a conserved region of about 70 amino acids found in
the following proteins:

 - Higher  eukaryotes  transcription  initiation  factor  TFIID 250 Kd subunit
   (TBP-associated factor  p250)  (gene  CCG1). P250 associated with the TFIID
   TATA-box binding  protein  and  seems  essential for progression  of the G1
   phase of the cell cycle.
 - Human  RING3,  a  protein  of  unknown function encoded in the MHC class II
   locus.
 - Mammalian  CREB-binding  protein (CBP), which mediates cAMP-gene regulation
   by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein.
 - Drosophila female sterile homeotic protein (gene fsh),  required maternally
   for proper   expression   of  other  homeotic  genes  involved  in  pattern
   formation, such as Ubx.
 - Drosophila brahma protein (gene brm), a protein required for the activation
   of multiple homeotic genes.
 - Mammalian  homologs  of  brahma.  In human,  three brahma-like proteins are
   known: SNF2a(hBRM), SNF2b, and BRG1.
 - Human  BS69,  a  protein  that  binds  to  adenovirus  E1A and inhibits E1A
   transactivation
 - Human peregrin (or Br140).
 - Yeast  BDF1  [3],  a  transcription  factor involved in the expression of a
   broad class of genes including snRNAs.
 - Yeast  GCN5,  a general transcriptional activator operating in concert with
   certain other   DNA-binding   transcriptional  activators,  such  as  GCN4,
   HAP2/3/4 or ADA2.
 - Yeast NPS1/STH1, involved in G(2) phase control in mitosis.
 - Yeast  SNF2/SWI2,  which is part of a complex with the SNF5, SNF6, SWI3 and
   ADR6/SWI1 proteins.   This   SWI-complex  is  involved  in  transcriptional
   activation.
 - Yeast SPT7, a transcriptional activator of  Ty elements and possibly  other
   genes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein cbp-1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR056w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKR008w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein L9638.1.

Some proteins  contain  a  region  which,  while  similar  to some extent to a
classical bromodomain,  diverges  from it by either lacking part of the domain
or because of an insertion. These proteins are:

 - Mammalian  protein  HRX (also known as All-1 or MLL), a protein involved in
   translocations leading  to  acute  leukemias  and  which possibly acts as a
   transcriptional regulatory  factor. HRX contains a region similar to the C-
   terminal half of the bromodomain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  protein  ZK783.4. The bromodomain of
   this protein has a 23 amino-acid insertion.
 - Yeast  protein  YTA7.  This  protein  contains  a  region  with significant
   similarity to  the C-terminal half of the bromodomain. As it is a member of
   the AAA  family  (see  <PDOC00572>)  it is also in a functionally different
   context.

The above proteins generally contain a single  bromodomain,  but  some of them
contain two  copies,  this  is the case of BDF1, CCG1, fsh, RING3, YKR008w and
L9638.1.

The exact function  of this domain is not yet known  but  it  is thought to be
involved in  protein-protein  interactions  and   it may be important  for the
assembly or  activity  of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional
activation.

The consensus  pattern  that  we  have  developed  spans  a  major part of the
bromodomain; a  more  sensitive    detection is available through the use of a
profile which spans the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: [STANVFHG]-x(2)-[FAS]-x(4)-[DNSPAKT]-x(0,7)-[DENQTFG]-Y-
                    [HFYLRKT]-x(2)-[LIVMFY]-x(3)-[LIVM]-x(4)-[LIVM]-x(6,10)-Y-
                    x(12,13)-[LIVM]-x(2)-N-[SACF]-x(2)-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the divergent types of bromodomains.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
