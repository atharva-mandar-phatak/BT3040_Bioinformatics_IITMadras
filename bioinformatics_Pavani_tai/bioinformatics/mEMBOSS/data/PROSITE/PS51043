* DDHD domain profile *
***********************

The   Nir/rdgB   (N-terminal  domain-interacting  receptor/Drosophila  retinal
degeneration B proteins) family has been identified in a variety of eukaryotic
organisms,  ranging  from  worms  to  mammals.  Members  of  this  family  are
implicated  in regulation of lipid trafficking, metabolism, and signaling. The
Nir/rdgB  proteins  contain  a  180  amino-acids-long  conserved region in the
central  part  of  the  protein. This domain contains four conserved residues,
DDHD,  which  may  form  a metal-binding site. This domain is named DDHD after
these four residues. This pattern of conservation of metal-binding residues is
often seen in phosphoesterase domains [1].

The  DDHD domain is found in the central part of Nir/rdgB proteins, as well as
the  C-terminal part of the phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1. The
DDHD  domain  function  is  not  currently  known  but it may be implicated in
phospholipid metabolism, membrane turnover, or intracellular trafficking [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire DDHD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
