* EXS domain profile *
**********************

The EXS  domain  was named after the yeast ERD1, the human XPR1, and the yeast
SYG1. In contrast to the SYG1 and XPR1 proteins, which have both a SPX and EXS
domain, the  majority  of proteins in yeast having one of these domains do not
harbor the other. In Arabidopsis, only the members of the PHO1 proteins family
possess both  a SPX and EXS domain. The function of the EXS domain is unknown,
although it  could  be involved in either phosphate transport or sensing or in
sorting proteins to endomembrane [1].

Some proteins known to contain a EXS domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 receptor (XPR1),
   initially identified as a retrovirus receptor but for which the function in
   uninfected cells remains unknown.
 - Yeast  SYG1, a protein involved in the mating pheromone signal transduction
   pathway.
 - Yeast   ERD1,  involved  in  the  localization  of  endogenous  endoplasmic
   reticulum proteins.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  PHO1, a protein involved in the loading of inorganic
   phosphate into the xylem of roots.
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana   PHO1-like   proteins  (identified  as  PHO1;H1  to
   PHO1;H10).

The profile we developed covers the entire EXS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2008 / First entry.
