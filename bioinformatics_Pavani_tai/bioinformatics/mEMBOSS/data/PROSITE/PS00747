*************************************

Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is  the obligatory precursor for the synthesis
of  all tetrapyrroles  including porphyrin derivatives such as chlorophyll and
heme.  ALA can be synthesized  via  two different pathways: the Shemin (or C4)
pathway which involves  the  single  step  condensation  of  succinyl-CoA  and
glycine and which  is  catalyzed by ALA  synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) and via the C5
pathway from the five-carbon skeleton of glutamate.  The C5  pathway  operates
in the chloroplast of  plants and algae,  in cyanobacteria, in some eubacteria
and in archaebacteria.

The initial step in the C5 pathway is carried out  by  glutamyl-tRNA reductase
(GluTR) [1]  which  catalyzes  the  NADP-dependent  conversion  of  glutamate-
tRNA(Glu)  to  glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) with  the concomitant release of
tRNA(Glu)  which  can  then  be  recharged  with  glutamate  by  glutamyl-tRNA
synthetase.

GluTR is a protein of about 50 Kd (467 to 550 residues)  which  contains a few
conserved region.  The best conserved region is located in positions 99 to 122
in the sequence of  known GluTR.  This region seems important for the activity
of the enzyme.  We have  developed a  signature  pattern  from  that conserved
region.

-Consensus pattern: [HY]-[LIVMAF]-x(2)-[LIVM]-[GSTACIV]-[GSTAC]-[GSA]-
                    [LIVMFA]-[DEQHY]-S-x-[LIVMAS]-[LIVMFKS]-[GFA]-[DE]-x-
                    [EQRD]-[IV]-[LIVTQAM]-[TAGRKS]-Q-[LIVMF]-[KRE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
