* DegV domain profile *
***********************

The DegV  protein family received its name based on sequence similarity to the
DegV protein  from  Bacillus subtilis. All members of the DegV family are from
bacteria, mostly  Firmicutes.  The  function  of  DegV  proteins  is  not  yet
completely understood,  but  structural  evidence indicates that they can bind
different fatty acids [1,2].

The DegV  domain  consists of two different alpha/beta folds (see <PDB:3FYS>).
The N-terminal  domain,  which  contains  seven  beta-strands  and  six alpha-
helices, can  be further divided into two subdomains: a three-layer alpha/beta
core domain  and  a  small  peripheral  subdomain  including  a three-stranded
antiparallel beta-sheet  and  one  alpha-helix. The C-terminal domain contains
six beta-strands   and   five   alpha-helices  in  a  two-layered  alpha/beta-
arrangement. The  two domains mainly interact through hydrophobic contacts and
form a ligand-binding pocket at the domain interface [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire DegV domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
