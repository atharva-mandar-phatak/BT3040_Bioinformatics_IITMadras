* Flavivirus NS2B and NS3 protease (NS3pro) domain profiles *
*************************************************************

Pathogenic members  of  the  flavivirus family [E1], including West Nile Virus
(WNV) and Dengue Virus (DV), are growing global threats for which there are no
specific treatments.  The  genome  encodes  three structural proteins found in
the mature virion (C, prM, and E) and seven "nonstructural" (i.e., not part of
the virion architecture) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).
Full-length NS3  is  a  bifunctional  protein.  The  N-terminal  175  residues
comprise a  chymotrypsin-like protease, "NS3pro", while the C-terminal portion
is a   helicase  ("NS3hel").  The  NS2B  protein,  which  is  located  in  the
polypeptide precursor  immediately upstream of the NS3pro domain, functions as
the cofactor  for  NS3pro.  A  35-48  residue  central portion is required for
protease activity  in  vitro,  while  N-  and  C-terminal flanking hydrophobic
regions are predicted to anchor the NS2B-NS3 complex into the host endoplasmic
reticulum  membrane. The  two component flaviviral enzyme NS2B-NS3 cleaves the
viral polyprotein  precursor  within the host cell, a process that is required
for viral  replication  [1,2,3].  The  NS3pro domain forms peptidase family S7
(flavivirin family) of clan PA [E2].

The NS3pro  has  a  classical  serine  protease catalytic triad (His, Asp, and
Ser). The  enzymatic  activity  of  NS3pro is enhanced by interacting with the
central 40  amino acid of NS2B which acts as an essential cofactor. The NS3pro
domain has  an  overall structure of two barrels made of six beta sheets each,
with the  active  site  located  in  the  cleft  between the barrels. The NS2B
hydrophilic core  cofactor  contributes one of the N-terminal beta sheets (see
<PDB:3L6P>) [1,2,3].

The profiles we developed cover the entire flavivirus NS2B and NS3pro domains.
