* Cyclotides profile and signatures *
*************************************

Cyclotides (cyclo peptides) are plant peptides of ~30 amino acids with a head-
to-tail cyclic  backbone and six cysteine residues involved in three disulfide
bonds as  shown  in  the  schematic  representation  below. The cyclotides are
extremely resistant  to  proteolysis  and  are  remarkably  stable. Cyclotides
display a   diverse  range  of  biological  activities,  including  uterotonic
activity, inhibition  of  neurotensin  binding,  hemolytic, anti-HIV and anti-
microbial activity.  This  range  of  biological  activities  makes cyclotides
amenable to  potential  pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. Although
their precise  role  in plants has not yet been reported, it appears that they
are most likely present as defense molecules [1,2,3,4].

The three-dimensional structure of cyclotides is compact and contains a number
of beta-turns,  three  beta  strands  arranged  in a distorted triple-stranded
beta-sheet, a  short  helical  segment, and a network of disulfide bonds which
form a cystine knot (see <PDB:1NBJ>). The cystine knot consists of an embedded
ring in  the  structure,  formed  by  two disulfide bonds and their connecting
backbone segments  is threaded by a third disulfide bond. Although the cystine
knot motif  is  now  well  known in a wide variety of proteins, the cyclotides
remain as  the  only  example  in  which  a  cystine knot is embedded within a
circular protein  backbone,  a motif that is referred to as the cyclic cystine
knot (CCK) [1,2,3,4].

'*': position of the pattern.

Cyclotides can  be  separated  into  two  sub-families,  one of which tends to
contain a larger number of positively charged residues and has a bracelet-like
circularization of  the  backbone.  The  second  subfamily contains a backbone
twist due  to  a  cis-Pro  peptide  bond and may conceptually be regarded as a
molecular Moebius  strip  [1,3].  Bracelet  and Moebius families of cyclotides
possess Knottin scaffold (see <PDOC60004>) [E2].

The cyclotide  family of proteins is abundant in plants from the Rubiaceae and
Violaceae families and includes:

 - kalata B1 [E1].
 - circulins.
 - cyclopsychotride A.
 - cycloviolacin O1.

We have  developed  a  profile that covers the whole length of cyclotides, and
two patterns   that  contain  the  first  three  cysteines  and  are  directed
respectively against the bracelet and Moebius subfamilies.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(0,1)-[ES]-S-C-[AV]-[MFYW]-I-[PS]-x(0,1)-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: C-[GA]-E-[ST]-C-[FTV]-[GLTI]-G-[TSK]-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Based  on  structural  similarities macrocyclic trypsin inhibitors have
 been proposed  to  form  a  third subfamily of plant cyclotides [5]. However,
 they display  no sequence homology to the bracelet and Moebius subfamilies of
 plant cyclotides,  but are homologous to the squash family of serine protease
 inhibitor (see <PDOC00258>).
