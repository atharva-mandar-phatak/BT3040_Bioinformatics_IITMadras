* p53 family signature *
************************

The  p53  tumor  antigen [1 to 5] is a protein found in increased amounts in a
wide variety of transformed cells. It is also detectable in many proliferating
nontransformed  cells,  but  it  is  undetectable  or present at low levels in
resting  cells.  It  is  frequently  mutated  or  inactivated in many types of
cancer.  p53 seems to act as a tumor suppressor in some, but probably not all,
tumor  types.  p53 is probably involved in cell cycle regulation, and may be a
trans-activator   that  acts  to  negatively  regulate  cellular  division  by
controlling a set of genes required for this process.

p53 is a phosphoprotein of about 390 amino acids which  can be subdivided into
four domains: a highly charged acidic region  of  about 75  to  80 residues, a
hydrophobic proline-rich  domain (position 80 to 150), a  central region (from
150 to about 300),  and a highly basic C-terminal region.  The sequence of p53
is well conserved in vertebrate species;  attempts  to  identify  p53 in other
eukaryotic philum has so far been unsuccessful.

The p53 protein belongs to a family [6] that also includes:

 - p51 (p63 or Ket), a transcriptional activator.
 - p73,  a  transcriptional  activator  that  participates  in  the  apoptotic
   response to DNA damage.

As a  signature  pattern for this family we selected a conserved stretch of 13
residues located in the central region of the protein.   This region, known as
domain IV in [3], is involved (along  with an adjacent region)  in the binding
of the large T antigen of SV40.  In man this region is the focus  of a variety
of point mutations in cancerous tumors.

-Consensus pattern: M-C-N-S-S-C-[MV]-G-G-M-N-R-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
