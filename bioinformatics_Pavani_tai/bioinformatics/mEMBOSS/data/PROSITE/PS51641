* Agenet-like domain profile *
******************************

Fragile X  Mental  Retardation  Protein  (FMRP), and its autosomal paralogues,
Fragile X mental Retardation syndrome-related protein 1 and 2 (FXR1 and FXR2),
comprise a  family of RNA-binding proteins. It is thought that the FRMP family
of proteins  contributes to the regulation of protein synthesis at sites where
mRNAs are locally translated in response to stimuli. These proteins are highly
similar to  one  another and also retain highly conserved domain architecture.
The two  ribonucleoprotein  K homology (KH)  domains (see <PDOC50084>) and the
cluster of arginine and glycine residues that constitute the RGG box, comprise
a large region that is important for RNA binding and polyribosome association.
In addition,  two  Agenet-like  domains  exist in tandem within the N-terminal
regions of FMRP family proteins. The Agenet-like domain belongs to the "Royal"
domain superfamilly  which  contains  also the Tudor (see <PDOC50304>), chromo
(see <PDOC00517>),  MBT  (see  <PDOC51079>),  PWWP (see <PDOC50812>) and plant
Agenet domains. Biochemical analysis of the tandem Agenet-like domains reveals
their ability   to   preferentially  recognize  trimethylated  peptides  in  a
sequence-specific manner [1,2,3,4].

The Agenet-like domain folds into a bent four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet
with a  fifth  strand  closing  the  cavity  of  the sheet, similar to a thumb
accross a semiclosed hand (see <PDB:2BKD>) [3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire Agenet-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
