*************************************

Phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) (PGK)  [1] catalyzes  the  second step in
the second phase of glycolysis, the  reversible  conversion of  1,3-diphospho-
glycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate  with  generation of one molecule of ATP.  PGK
is found in all  living organisms and  its  sequence has been highly conserved
throughout evolution. It is a  two-domain protein;  each domain is composed of
six repeats  of  an  alpha/beta  structural  motif. As a signature pattern for
PGK's, we selected a conserved region in the N-terminal region.

-Consensus pattern: [KRHGTCVN]-[VT]-[LIVMF]-[LIVMC]-R-x-D-x-N-[SACV]-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
