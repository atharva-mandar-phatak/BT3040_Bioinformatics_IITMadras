* Vitellogenin domain profile *
*******************************

The vitellogenin (VTG) protein, a major lipoprotein in many oviparous animals,
is  a precursor of a lipid-binding product named as lipovitellin. Lipovitellin
is  the  major  lipid–protein complex found in the yolk of egg-laying animals,
and  is  involved in lipid and metal storage. At the N-terminal, it contains a
sequence  of  about  670  amino acids (LV1n chain), which is also conserved in
other  large  lipoproteins,  such  as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
(MTP) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) [1,2,3].

The crystal structure of lipovitellin has been solved (see <PDB:1LSH>) [4]. It
shows  that  the  N-terminal domain (LV1n chain) contains two subdomains the N
sheet,  and  the  helical  subdomain.  It  also  includes portions of two more
subdomains,  which are part of the LV1c chain, one beta-strand of the A-sheet,
and   five  beta-strands  of  the  C-sheet.  The  N-sheet  subdomain  forms  a
barrel-like  conformation.  It  contains  two  disulfide  bridges  (cys1-cys2,
cys3-cys4). The first disulfide bridge appears to be conserved in both MTP and
apoB  [1,4].  The  helical subdomain has a crescent shape. This subdomain also
contains  one  disulfide bridge (cys1-cys2) [1,3]. The lipid-binding cavity is
formed  primarily  by  the  A  and C sheets and a small section of the helical
domain.  It  is  roughly  funnel-  or cup-shaped. The phosphatidylcholine, L1,
binds  in  a  large  loop  at  the narrow end of the lipid ‘funnel’. This loop
region  is  stabilized  on  both  ends by the N-sheet disulfide bridges. L2 is
located  in  a nonpolar region of the protein and has hydrophobic interactions
with  residues  from  the  N sheet. The other part of the binding site derives
from the A sheet and includes side chains from the LV1c.

Some proteins known to contain a vitellogenin domain are listed below:

 - Insect  apolipophorin II/I precursor (apoLp-II/I), which mediates transport
   for  various  types  of lipids in hemolymph. It acts by forming lipoprotein
   particles that bind lipoproteins and lipids.
 - Human  apolipoprotein  B  (apoB),  which  is a major protein constituent of
   chylomicrons  (apo  B-48),  LDL (apo B-100) and VLDL (apo B-100). Apo B-100
   functions   as   a   recognition   signal  for  the  cellular  binding  and
   internalization of LDL particles by the apoB/E receptor
 - Invertebrate  and vertebrate vitellogenins (VTG), which is precursor of the
   egg-yolk  proteins  that  are  sources  of  nutrients  during  during early
   development of oviparous organisms.
 - The  large  subunit  of  mammalian microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
   (MTP),  which  catalyzes  the transport of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester,
   and  phospholipid  between  phospholipid  surfaces.  It is required for the
   secretion of plasma lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B.

We  developed a profile for this domain, that spans the whole LV1n domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
