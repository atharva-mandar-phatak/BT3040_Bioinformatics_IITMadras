* Sin domain profile *
**********************

Spore formation  is  an  extreme  response  of  some bacteria to adversity. In
Bacillus subtilis the proteins of the sin, sporulation inhibition, region form
a component  of an elaborate molecular circuitry that regulates the commitment
to sporulation. SinR (formerly known as Sin) is a tetrameric repressor protein
that binds  to the promoters of genes essential for entry into sporulation and
prevents their transcription. This repression is overcome through the activity
of SinI,  which disrupts the SinRtetramer through the formation of a SinI-SinR
heterodimer. In this complex, SinR is unable to bind to DNA and its repressive
effects on  transcription  are relieved. SinR and SinI share a multimerisation
domain of ~40 amino acids [1,2].

The structure  reveals  an  alpha-helical  assembly  comprising two domains of
approximately equal  size, an oligomerisation domain  stabilised by an unusual
intermolecular hydrophobic  core,  and  a  DNA-binding domain formed by the N-
terminal residues of SinR, which form five alpha-helices (see <PDB:1B0N>). The
oligomerisation domain  is  formed  by  four  alpha-helices,  two  from the C-
terminal residues of SinR and two from the central residues of SinI. The pairs
of helices  from  the respective molecules interpenetrate like the forefingers
and thumbs  in a handshake. This arrangement vuries an unusually extensive and
closely packed  intermolecular  apolar  core,  reminiscent of a folded protein
domain. The  pairs  of  helices  from  the  respective proteins can be closely
superimposed so  that  conserved  hydrophobic  residues align at corresponding
positions on  the  inner  faces of the helices. This conservation of structure
and sequence  suggests that the C-terminal helices of two SinR molecules could
also interpenetrate in a similar manner to form SinR dimers and tetramers. The
interactions between  pairs  of SinR monomers must be weaker than those in the
SinI-SinR heterodimer, since SinI efficiently disrupts SinR tetramers [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire Sin domain.
