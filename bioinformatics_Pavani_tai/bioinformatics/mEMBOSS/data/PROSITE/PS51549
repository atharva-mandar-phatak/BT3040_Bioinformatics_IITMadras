* DM13 domain profile *
***********************

The DM13  domain  has  been  identified  in animal proteins containing a DOMON
domain (see  <PDOC50836>) likely to function as cytochromes involved in as yet
unidentified redox  reactions  potentially related to protein hydroxylation or
oxidative cross-linking.  However,  it  is  also  found  in bacteria. The DM13
domain contains   a   nearly  absolutely  conserved  cysteine,  which  can  be
potentially involved  in a redox reaction either as a nacked thiol group or by
binding a prosthetic group like heme [1].

The DM13 domain is predicted to have a beta-strand-rich fold [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire DM13 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 2011 / First entry.
