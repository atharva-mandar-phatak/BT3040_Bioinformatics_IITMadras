* VIT domain profile *
**********************

The inter-alpha-trypsin   inhibitor  (ITI)  family  is  composed  of  protease
inhibitors that  are  assembled from two precursor proteins: a light chain and
different homologous  heavy  chains  (ITIHs).  Originally identified as plasma
inhibitors, recent data indicate that ITI plays a role in extracellular matrix
stabilization and in prevention of tumor metastasis [1].

Two domains  are  conserved in all known ITIHs, the vault protein inter-alpha-
trypsin (VIT)   domain   and  a  von  Willebrand  type  A  (vWA)  domain  (see
<PDOC50234>). The VIT domain is less widespread than the vWA domain and is not
genetically mobile. Therefore, it can be regarded as the characteristic domain
of the  ITIH family. The VIT domain is approximately 135 amino acids long. Its
N-terminal part  contains  a pattern of hydrophobic residues, interrupted by a
conserved arginine.  The  C-terminus  is  best  characterized by its conserved
aromatic residues.  In  the central part, an acidic amino acid resides between
two basic residues [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire VIT domain.
