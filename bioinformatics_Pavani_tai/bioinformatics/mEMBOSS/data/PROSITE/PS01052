* Calponin-like repeat signature and profile *
**********************************************

Calponin [1,2] is a thin filament-associated protein that is implicated in the
regulation and  modulation  of  smooth  muscle  contraction.  It is capable of
binding to  actin,  calmodulin, troponin C and tropomyosin. The interaction of
calponin with  actin  inhibits the actomyosin MgATPase activity. Calponin is a
basic protein  of  approximately 34 Kd.  Multiple isoforms are found in smooth
muscles.

Calponin contains  three  repeats  of a well conserved motif of about 26 amino
acids. Such  a  domain  is  also  found  in  a  number of other proteins whose
physiological role is not yet established:

 - Vertebrate  transgelin  (also known as smooth muscle protein SM22-alpha) (1
   copy).
 - Mammalian transgelin 2.
 - Drosophila synchronous flight muscle protein SM20 (1 copy).
 - Rat neuronal protein NP25 [3] (1 copy).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-87 [4] (5 copies).
 - An Onchocerca volvulus antigen [5] (5 copies).

Most of  these proteins also contain a N-terminal CH domain (see <PDOC50021>).
The calponin-like  repeat is a short actin-binding module. Actin-binding sites
formed by  either  CH  domains  or  calponin-like repeats occupy non-competing
binding sites along the actin filament [6].

We developed  both  a  pattern and a profile for the calponin-like repeat. The
signature pattern  corresponds  to  the first 20 residues, whereas the profile
covers the entire calponin-like repeat.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[LS]-Q-[MASY]-G-[STY]-[NT]-[KRQ]-x(2)-[STN]-Q-x-
                    G-x(3,4)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: June 2005 / Profile added and text revised.
