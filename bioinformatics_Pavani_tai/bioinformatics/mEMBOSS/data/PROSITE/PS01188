************************
* ELO family signature *
************************

The ELO  family  consist  of eukaryotic integral membrane proteins involved in
fatty acid elongation. This family consist of:

 - Mammalian  proteins  ELOVL1  to  ELOVL4  [1]. These proteins all seem to be
   involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids.
 - Yeast ELO1, ELO2 and ELO3 [2]. They seem to be components of membrane-bound
   fatty acid elongation systems.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C40H1.4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein D2024.3.

The proteins have from 271 to 435 amino acid residues. Structurally, they seem
to be  formed  of  three  sections: a N-terminal region with two transmembrane
domains, a central hydrophilic loop and a C-terminal region that contains from
one to  three  transmembrane  domains.  As  a  signature pattern we selected a
conserved region that contains three histidines. This region is located in the
hydrophilic loop.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-x-F-[LIV]-H-[VYWT]-[FY]-H-H
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2002 / Pattern and text revised.
