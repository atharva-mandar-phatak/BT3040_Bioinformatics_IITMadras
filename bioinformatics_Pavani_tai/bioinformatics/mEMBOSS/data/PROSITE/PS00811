* Oleosins signature *
**********************

Oleosins [1] are the proteinaceous  components of plants' lipid storage bodies
called oil bodies. Oil bodies are small droplets (0.2 to 1.5 mu-m in diameter)
containing  mostly  triacylglycerol  that  are  surrounded  by a phospholipid/
oleosin annulus. Oleosins may have a  structural role in stabilizing the lipid
body during dessication of the seed, by  preventing  coalescence of  the  oil.
They may  also  provide recognition signals for specific lipase  anchorage  in
lipolysis  during seedling growth.  Oleosins are found in the monolayer lipid/
water interface  of oil bodies and probably  interact with both the lipid  and
phospholipid moieties.

Oleosins are proteins of 16 Kd to 24 Kd  and are composed of three domains: an
N-terminal  hydrophilic region of  variable length (from 30 to 60 residues); a
central  hydrophobic  domain of about 70 residues and a C-terminal amphipathic
region of  variable length (from 60 to 100 residues).  The central hydrophobic
domain is proposed to be made up of beta-strand structure and to interact with
the lipids  [2].  It is  the  only domain  whose sequence  is conserved and we
have therefore selected a section from that domain as a signature pattern.
