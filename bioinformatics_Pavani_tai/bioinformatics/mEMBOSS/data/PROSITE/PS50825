* HYR domain profile *
**********************

The HYR  (HYalin  Repeat)  domain  is  an extracellular domain of about 80-100
amino acids.  It  has  been  named after the hyalin protein, which is composed
exclusively of  repeats  of  this  domain.  The HYR domain is found in several
eukaryotic proteins,  either in multiple copies as in hyalin or in association
with other domains like the CCP (sushi) domain, the Von Willebrand factor type
A (VWA)  domain  (see <PDOC50234>), the EGF-like domain (see <PDOC00021>), the
calcium-binding EGF-like  domain  (see <PDOC00913>), the pentraxin domain (see
<PDOC00261>), the  CUB  domain  (see  <PDOC00908>),  the  LDL-receptor class A
domain (see  <PDOC00929>),  the  C-type lectin domain (see <PDOC00537>) or the
discoidin domain.  As the HYR domains of hyalin have been shown to contain the
ligand for  the  hyalin  cell  surface  receptor,  the  HYR domain can also be
expected to play a direct role in cellular adhesion in other proteins in which
it is present [1].

Secondary structure  predictions  of  the HYR domain indicate an all-beta fold
including seven   beta-strands.   The   HYR   domain   shares  clear  sequence
similarities limited to the C-terminal region with the Fn3 and PKD domains and
is believed to belong to the immunoglobulin-like fold [1].

Some proteins containing a HYR domain are listed below:

 - Echinoderm hyalin, a protein of the extra-embryonic matrix.
 - Mouse  polydom, a secreted protein with pentraxin, CCP, EGF and VWA domains
   [2].
 - Mammalian  sushi-repeat-containing  protein  (SRPX).  It  is  thought to be
   located at the photoreceptor cell surface. In human, the gene encoding SRPX
   is deleted in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans  hypothetical  proteins  F55H12.3,  F47C12.10  and
   W02C12.1.

The profile we developed covers the entire HYR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: September 2003 / First entry.

-Note: The  HYR  domain  of  SRPX  was  first  suggested to be a divergent CCP
 module [3].  Although  both  modules  should have similar secondary structure
 pattern, they   are  clearly  distinguishable  by  the  number  of  conserved
 cysteines and sequence analysis tools [1].
