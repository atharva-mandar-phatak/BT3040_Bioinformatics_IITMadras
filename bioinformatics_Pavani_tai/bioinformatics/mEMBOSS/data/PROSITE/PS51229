* DCUN1 domain profile *
************************

The DCUN1  domain  is an ~190-residue module found in the eukaryotic defective
in cullin neddylation (DCN) protein family, which includes:

 - Yeast DCN1.
 - Vertebrate DCN1-like protein 1.
 - Vertebrate DCN1-like protein 2.
 - Vertebrate DCN1-like protein 4.

Proteins of  the DCN family may contribute to neddylation of cullin components
of SCF-type  E3  ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are multi-protein complexes
required for  polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins
by the  26S  proteasome [1]. Although the DCUN1 domain function is unknown, it
has been  suggested  that  it has features of a basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper (bHLH-ZIP) domain [2].

The DCUN1 domain can be found in association with an UBA-like domain [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire DCUN1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
