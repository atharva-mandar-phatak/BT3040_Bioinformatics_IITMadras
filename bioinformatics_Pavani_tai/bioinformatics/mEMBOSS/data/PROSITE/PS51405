* Heme haloperoxidase family profile *
**************************************

Heme  haloperoxidase  or  chloroperoxidase  (CPO)  is  an  ~250  residue heme-
containing  glycoprotein  that  is  secreted  by  various fungi. CPO was first
identified   in   Caldariomyces   fumago   where  it  catalyzes  the  hydrogen
peroxide-dependent  chlorination  of cyclopentanedione during the biosynthesis
of  the  antibiotic caldarioymcin. Additionally, heme haloperoxidase catalyzes
the  iodination  and  bromination  of  a  wide  range  of  substrates. Besides
performing   H2O2-dependent   halogenation  reactions,  the  enzyme  catalyzes
dehydrogenation  reactions. CPO also functions as a catalase, facilitating the
decomposition  of  hydrogen  peroxide  to  oxygen and water. Furthermore, heme
haloperoxidase  catalyzes P450-like oxygen insertion reactions. The capability
of  heme haloperoxidase to perform these diverse reactions makes it one of the
most versatile of all known heme proteins [1,2].

Despite  functional  similarities with other heme enzymes, heme haloperoxidase
folds into a novel tertiary structure dominated by eight helical segments (see
<PDB:  1CPO>)  [3]. Structurally, heme haloperoxidase is unique, but it shares
features  with  both  peroxidases  and  P450  enzymes.  As  in cytochrome P450
enzymes,  the  proximal  heme ligand of the heme haloperoxidase is a cysteine,
but  similar  to  peroxidases,  the distal side of the heme is polar. However,
unlike  other  peroxidases,  the normally conserved distal arginine is lacking
and the catalytic acid base is a glutamic acid and not a histidine [4].

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the  whole  conserved  region of the heme
haloperoxidase family.
