* IMP dehydrogenase / GMP reductase signature *
***********************************************

IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205)  (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction
of de novo GTP biosynthesis,  the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP [1].
Inhibition  of  IMP  dehydrogenase  activity  results  in the cessation of DNA
synthesis. As IMP dehydrogenase is associated with cell proliferation, it is a
possible target for cancer chemotherapy.  Mammalian  and  bacterial IMPDHs are
tetramers of identical chains.  There are  two  IMP  dehydrogenase isozymes in
humans [2].

GMP reductase (EC 1.7.1.7)  catalyzes  the  irreversible  and  NADPH-dependent
reductive deamination  of GMP into IMP [3]. It converts nucleobase, nucleoside
and nucleotide derivatives of G to A  nucleotides, and maintains intracellular
balance of A and G nucleotides.

IMP dehydrogenase and GMP reductase share many regions of sequence similarity.
One of  these  regions  is  centered  on  a cysteine residue thought [3] to be
involved in binding IMP. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMT]-[RK]-[LIVM]-G-[LIVM]-G-x-G-[SRK]-[LIVMAT]-C-x-T
                    [C may be the IMP-binding residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
