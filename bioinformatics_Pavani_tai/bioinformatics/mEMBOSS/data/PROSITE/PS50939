* Cytochrome b561 domain profile *
**********************************

Cytochromes b561  constitute a class of intrinsic membrane proteins containing
two heme  molecules  that  are involved in ascorbate (vitamin C) regeneration.
They have  been  suggested  to  function  as  electron transporters, shuttling
electrons across  membranes  from  ascorbate to an acceptor molecule. The one-
electron oxidation product of ascorbate, monodehydro-ascorbate (MDHA) has been
shown to  function  as an electon acceptor for mammalian and plant cytochromes
b561. The   cytochrome   b561-catalyzed  reduction  of  MDHA  results  in  the
regeneration of  the  fully  reduced ascorbate molecule. Cytochromes b561 have
been identified in a large number of phylogenetically distant species, but are
absent in  prokaryotes.  Most  species  contain  three or four cytochrome b561
paralogous proteins [1].

Members of the cytochrome b561 protein family are characterized by a number of
structural features,  likely to play an essential part in their function. They
are highly  hydrophobic  proteins  with  six transmembrane helices (named TMH1
through TMH6),  four  conserved  histidine residues, probably coordinating the
two heme  molecules,  and  predicted substrate-binding sites for ascorbate and
MDHA [1].  The functionally relevant and structurally most conserved region in
the cytochrome  b561  family is the TMH2 to -5 4-helix core with an amino acid
composition that is very well conserved in the inner surface and somewhat less
conserved in the outer surface of the core. The two terminal helices (TMH1 and
TMH6) are less conserved [2,3].

The profile   we  developed  covers  the  six  transmembrane  helices  of  the
cytochrome b561 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
