* Cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase signature & profile *
****************************************************************************

Cyclophilin [1] is  the  major high-affinity  binding  protein  in vertebrates
for  the immunosuppressive  drug  cyclosporin A (CSA). It exhibits a peptidyl-
prolyl cis-trans  isomerase activity (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase
is an  enzyme  that  accelerates protein folding by catalyzing  the  cis-trans
isomerization  of proline    imidic  peptide bonds in oligopeptides [2]. It is
probable that  CSA  mediates  some  of its effects via an inhibitory action on
PPIase.  Cyclophilin  is a cytosolic protein which belongs to a family [3,4,5]
that also includes the following isozymes:

 - Cyclophilin B  (or S-cyclophilin),  a  PPIase   which  is  retained  in  an
   endoplasmic reticulum compartment.
 - Cyclophilin C, a cytoplasmic PPiase.
 - Mitochondrial matrix cyclophilin (cyp3).
 - A  PPIase  which  seems  specific  for  the  folding of rhodopsin and is an
   integral membrane  protein  anchored  by a C-terminal transmembrane region.
   This protein was first characterized in Drosophila (gene ninaA).
 - Bacterial periplasmic PPiase (gene ppiA).
 - Bacterial cytosolic PPiase (gene ppiB).
 - Natural-killer cell  cyclophilin-related protein. This large protein (about
   160 Kd) is a component of a putative tumor-recognition  complex involved in
   the function of NK cells. It contains a cyclophilin-type PPiase domain.
 - Mammalian  nucleoporin Nup358 [6], a nuclear pore complex protein of 358 Kd
   that contains a C-terminal cyclophilin-type PPiase domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR032w.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC21E11.05c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T27D1.1.

The sequences of  the  different  forms  of cyclophilin-type  PPIases are well
conserved.  As  a signature pattern, we  selected  a  conserved region  in the
central part of these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-x(2)-[STCNLVA]-x-[FV]-H-[RH]-[LIVMNS]-[LIVM]-x(2)-F-
                    [LIVM]-x-Q-[AGFT]-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 7 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: FKBP's,  a  family  of  proteins  that  bind the immunosuppressive drug
 FK506, are also PPIases,  but their sequence is not at all related to that of
 cyclophilin (see <PDOC00426>).
