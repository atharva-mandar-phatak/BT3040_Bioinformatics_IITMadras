* Class VI SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
************************************************************

Methyltransferases  (EC  2.1.1.-)  constitute  an  important  class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [1,2,3]. The substrates that are methylated
by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules,  to  lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Methyltransferases
are   therefore  involved  in  many  essential  cellular  processes  including
biosynthesis,  signal  transduction,  protein repair, chromatin regulation and
gene  silencing  [1,2,3].  More  than  230  different  enzymatic  reactions of
methyltransferases  have been described so far, of which more than 220 use SAM
as  the  methyl  donor  [E1].  A  review  published  in  2003  [2] divides all
methyltransferases  into  5  classes based on the structure of their catalytic
domain (fold):
 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta     see <PDOC51555>
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta     see <PDOC51604>
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta       see <PDOC51565>
A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:
 - class VI:   transmembrane			all alpha
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

So far, methyltransferases that have been assigned to Class VI (transmembrane)
are  all  multi-pass  proteins  [3]  and  they  all have been localized to the
endoplamic  reticulum  membrane  [3,4,5]. Some methyltransferases belonging to
this  class  have been implicated in the formation of phosphatidylcholine (PC)
from  phosphatidylethanolamine  (PE) [6] and others to the carboxy-methylation
of proteins containing a C-terminal CAAX motif [5].

Some enzymatic activities known to belong to the Class VI superfamily:

 - CHO2 phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.17).
 - PEMT/PEM2  methyltransferases: phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
   (EC 2.1.1.17), methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase (EC 2.1.1.16) and
   other PEMT/PEM2 methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.-).
 - Protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.100).

The profiles we developed to identify Class VI SAM-dependent methyltransferases
families are directed against whole length proteins.
