* WAC domain profile *
**********************

ACF (for   ATP-utilizing  chromatin  assembly  and  remodeling  factor)  is  a
chromatin-remodeling complex  that  catalyzes  the  ATP-dependent  assembly of
periodic nucleosome   arrays.   This  reaction  utilizes  the  energy  of  ATP
hydrolysis by  ISWI,  the  smaller of the two subunits of ACF. Acf1, the large
subunit of  ACF,  is  essential  for the full activity of the complex. The WAC
(WSTF/Acf1/cbp146) domain  is  an ~110-residue module present at the N-termini
of Acf1-related proteins in a variety of organisms. It is found in association
with other  domains  such  as  the bromodomain (see <PDOC00550>), the PHD-type
zinc finger  (see <PDOC50016>), DDT (see <PDOC50827>) or WAKS. The DNA-binding
region of  Acf1  includes the WAC domain, which is necessary for the efficient
binding of  ACF  complex to DNA. It seems probable that the WAC domain will be
involved in DNA binding in other related factors [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a WAC domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila  melanogaster  ATP-dependent  chromatin  assembly  factor  large
   subunit Acf1.
 - Human WSTF (Williams syndrome transcription factor).
 - Mouse cbp146.
 - Yeast imitation switch two complex protein 1 (ITC1 or YGL133w).
 - Yeast protein YPL216w.

The profile we developed covers the entire WAC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
