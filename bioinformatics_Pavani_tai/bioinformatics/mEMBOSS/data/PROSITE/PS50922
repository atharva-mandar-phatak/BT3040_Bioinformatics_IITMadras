* TLC domain profile *
**********************

The TLC  (TRAM-LAG1-CLN8)  domain  is  an  about 200-residue domain found in a
family of  membrane-associated  proteins  related  to yeast LAG1 and mammalian
TRAM. It  is  predicted  to  contain  five  transmembrane  alpha  helices [1].
Although the  role of the TLC domain is not known, four possible function have
been suggested:

 - it  could  catalyze the synthesis of ceramide-like moieties and/or activate
   lipid synthesis,
 - it could protect proteins from proteolyis,
 - it could be involved in lipid transport,
 - or it could also act as a lipid sensor.

Some proteins known to contain a TLC domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate   TRAM   (translocation  associated  protein),  a  regulator  of
   polypeptide translocation  into the ER and appears to modulate the exposure
   of translocating proteins in the cytosol.
 - Yeast  Longevity-assurance  protein  1 (LAG1), a regulator of longevity and
   ageing. It   facilitates   endoplasmic  reticulum  to  Golgi  transport  of
   glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins.
 - Mammalian  CLN8,  a  multi-pass  transmembrane  protein, which is localized
   mainly to  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)  and partially to the ER-Golgi
   intermediate compartment.  In  human,  defects  in  CLN8  are  a  cause  of
   progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR); also known as neuronal
   ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) type 8 and Northern epilepsy. In mouse, defects
   in CLN8  are  the  cause  of the phenotype motor neuron degeneration (mnd),
   which is a naturally occuring NCL.

The profile we developed spans the entire TLC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
