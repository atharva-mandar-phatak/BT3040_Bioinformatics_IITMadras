* G5 domain profile *
*********************

The G5  domain (named after its conserved glycine residues) is a module of ~80
residues that  is  found  in  a  variety  of enzymes such as Streptococcal IgA
peptidases and  various glycosyl hydrolases in bacteria. It is found in one to
seven copies  in  association  with other domains, such as LysM, bacterial Ig-
like, M23  and M26 peptidases, F5/8 type C, vanW or transglycosylase-like. The
G5 domain  contains  a  few highly conserved residues. None of these conserved
residues are the polar types of amino acids found in active sites, so it seems
unlikely this  region  has an enzymatic function. However, in nearly all cases
the G5  domain  is associated with a known enzymatic domain. Therefore, the G5
domain may  confer  localization  or  substrate specificity on the proteins in
which it  is  found. As a common feature of the proteins containing G5 domains
is N-acetylglucosamine binding, it has been suggested that this function might
be attributed   to  the  G5  domain.  Other  alternative  functions  could  be
allosteric regulation of the enzymatic domain or cofactor binding [1].

Some proteins known to contain a G5 domain are listed below:

 - Staphylococcus aureus plasmin-sensitive surface protein (pls).
 - Streptococcal IgA1 peptidases, metallopeptidases that belong to family M26.
   IgA1 peptidases  are important proteins for pathogens that colonise mucosal
   surfaces. To  evade  the  host  immune  defences  these  bacteria produce a
   peptidase that  cleaves  IgA1  -  the predominant immunoglobulin of mucosal
   surfaces.
 - Streptococcus  pneumoniae  beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase  (strH),  a glycosyl
   hydrolase.
 - Streptococcus  pneumoniae  Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D (Endo D). It
   cleaves the  di-N-acetylchitobiose  structure (a 1-4 linked disaccharide of
   N-acetylglucosamine) in  N-linked  oligosaccharides  and  generally acts on
   complex oligosaccharides  after  the  removal  of  external sugars by beta-
   galactosidase and beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase.
 - Bacterial  proteins  of  the vanW family. The vanW gene is found as part of
   the Vancomycin  resistance  gene  cluster,  but as yet no function has been
   identified for these proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire G5 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
