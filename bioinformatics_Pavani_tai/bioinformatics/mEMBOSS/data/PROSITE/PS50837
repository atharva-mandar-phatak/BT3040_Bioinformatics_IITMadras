* NACHT-NTPase domain profile *
*******************************

The NACHT  domain is a  300 to 400 residue predicted nucleoside triphosphatase
(NTPase) domain,  which is found in animal, fungal and bacterial proteins. The
NACHT domain  has  been named after NAIP, CIITA, HET-E and TP1. It is found in
association with other domains, such as the CARD domain (see <PDOC50209>), the
DAPIN domain  (see  <PDOC50824>),  the  HEAT  repeat (see <PDOC50077>), the WD
repeat (see <PDOC00574>), the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) or the BIR repeat (see
<PDOC00987) [1].

The NACHT  domain  consists  of seven distinct conserved motifs, including the
ATP/GTPase specific  P-loop (see <PDOC00017>), the Mg(2+)-binding site (Walker
A and  B  motifs,  respectively)  and  five  more  specific motifs. The unique
features of  the  NACHT  domain  include  the  prevalence  of  'tiny' residues
(glycine, alanine  or  serine)  directly C-terminal of the Mg(2+)-coordinating
aspartate in the Walker B motif, in place of a second acidic residue prevalent
in other  NTPases.  A  second  acidic residue is typically found in the NACHT-
containing proteins  two  positions  downstream. Furthermore, the distal motif
VII contains  a  conserved pattern of polar, aromatic and hydrophobic residues
that is not seen in any other NTPase family [1].

Some proteins known to contain a NACHT domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP).
 - Mammalian MHC class II transcription activator (CIITA).
 - Mammalian telomerase-associated protein (TP1).
 - Human CARD4 (NOD1), a pro-apoptotic protein, which activate NF-kappaB.
 - Streptomyces coelicolor predicted NTPases.
 - Synechocystis sp predicted NTPase.
 - Podosporina anserina incompatibility locus protein (HET-E).

The profile we developed covers the entire NACHT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2002 / First entry.
