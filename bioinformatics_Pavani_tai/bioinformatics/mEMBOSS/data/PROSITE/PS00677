* D-amino acid oxidases signature *
***********************************

D-amino acid  oxidase  (EC  1.4.3.3) (DAMOX or DAO) is an FAD flavoenzyme that
catalyzes the  oxidation  of  neutral  and  basic  D-amino  acids  into  their
corresponding keto  acids. DAOs have been characterized and sequenced in fungi
and vertebrates where they are known to be located in the peroxisomes.

D-aspartate oxidase  (EC  1.4.3.1)  (DASOX)  [1]  is  an  enzyme, structurally
related to  DAO,  which  catalyzes the same reaction but is active only toward
dicarboxylic D-amino acids.

In DAO, a  conserved  histidine  has  been  shown  [2] to be important for the
enzyme's catalytic  activity.    We have used the conserved region around this
residue as a signature pattern for these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-H-[NHA]-Y-G-x-[GSA](2)-x-G-x(5)-G-x-A
                    [H may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
