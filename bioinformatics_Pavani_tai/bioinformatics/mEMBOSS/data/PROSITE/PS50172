* BRCT domain profile *
***********************

The breast cancer susceptibility gene contains at its C-terminus two copies of
a conserved  domain  that  was named BRCT for BRCA1 C-terminus. This domain of
about 95  amino acids is found in a large variety of proteins involved in DNA-
repair, recombination  and  cell cycle control [1,2,3]. The BRCT domain is not
limited to  the  C-termini  of  protein sequences and can be found in multiple
copies or  in  a single copy as in RAP1 and TdT. Recent data [4] indicate that
the BRCT domain functions as a protein-protein interaction module.

The structure of the first of the two C-terminal BRCT domains of the human DNA
repair protein  XRCC1  has  recently  been determined by X-ray crystallography
[4].

Some proteins known to contain a BRCT domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein. It may regulate gene
   expression.
 - Human p53-binding protein 1.
 - Human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (EC 2.4.2.30). It modifies various
   nuclear proteins by poly(ADP-rybosyl)ation.
 - Vertebrate DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (EC 2.7.7.31). It adds nucleotides
   at the junction (N region) of rearranged Ig heavy chain and T cell receptor
   gene segments during the maturation of B and T cells.
 - Mammalian DNA-repair protein XRCC1.
 - Human  DNA  ligase  III  (EC  6.5.1.1).  It is involved in DNA strand-break
   repair.
 - Human DNA ligase IV (EC 6.5.1.1).
 - Drosophila germline transcription factor 1. A putative transcription factor
   active during oogenesis and embryogenesis.
 - Baker's yeast DNA ligase II (EC 6.5.1.1).
 - Baker's yeast RAD9 protein. It is essential for cell cycle arrest following
   DNA damage by X-irradiation or inactivation of DNA ligase.
 - Baker's yeast RAP1. It is involved in telomeric and HM loci silencing.
 - Escherichia  coli  DNA  ligase  (EC  6.5.1.2).  It  is  essential  for  DNA
   replication and repair of damaged DNA.
 - Synechocystis sp. DNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.2). It is probably essential for DNA
   replication and repair of damaged DNA.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
