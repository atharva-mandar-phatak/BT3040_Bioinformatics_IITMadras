* RpiR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  rpiR-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  75-80  amino  acids present in prokaryotic regulators of transcription.
The  domain  is  named  after  Escherichia  coli  rpiR,  also known as alsR, a
repressor  of the rpiB gene and the als operon, which encode proteins involved
in  sugar  metabolism.  The DNA-binding rpiR-type HTH domain occurs usually in
the  N-terminal  part;  the C-terminal part can contain a phosphosugar-binding
SIS  domain. Most rpiR-type HTH regulators are involved in sugar metabolism as
transcription repressors, but some are activators [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a rpiR-type HTH domain:

 - Escherichia   coli   rpiR,   a   transcription   repressor   of   ripB,   a
   ribose-phosphate  isomerase,  and  of the als operon, involved in transport
   and metabolism of allose.
 - Pseudomonas  aeruginosa hexR, a transcription repressor of the hex regulon,
   involved in sugar metabolism.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  glvR,  a  transcription  activator  of  the glv operon,
   involved in transport and metabolism of maltose [3].

The profile we developed spans the entire rpiR-type HTH DNA-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
