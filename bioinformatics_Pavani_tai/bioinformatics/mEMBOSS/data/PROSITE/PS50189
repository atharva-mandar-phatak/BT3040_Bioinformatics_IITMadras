* NTR domain profile *
**********************

The netrin  (NTR)  module  is  an  about  130-residue  domain  found in the C-
terminal parts  of  netrins,  complement  proteins  C3,  C4,  and C5, secreted
frizzled-related proteins,   and  type  I  procollagen  C-proteinase  enhancer
proteins (PCOLCEs), as well as in the N-terminal parts of tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs)  (see  <PDOC00260>). The proteins harboring the NTR
domain fulfill diverse biological roles ranging from axon guidance, regulation
of Wnt  signalling,  to the control of the activity of metalloproteinases. The
NTR domain  can  be  found  associated  to  other  domains  such  as  CUB (see
<PDOC00908>), WAP  (see  <PDOC00026>),  Kazal  (see  <PDOC00254>), Kunitz (see
<PDOC00252>), Ig-like  (see <PDOC50835>), laminin N-terminal, laminin-type EGF
(see <PDOC00961>)  or frizzled (see <PDOC50038>). The NTR domain is implicated
in inhibition of zinc metalloproteinases of the metzincin family [1,2].

The NTR module is a basic domain containing six conserved cysteines, which are
likely to  form  internal  disulfide  bonds,  and  several conserved blocks of
hydrophobic residues  (including an YLLLG-like motif). The NTR module consists
of a  beta-barrel  with two terminal alpha-helices packed side by side against
the face of the beta-barrel (see <PDB:1BR9>) [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire NTR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
