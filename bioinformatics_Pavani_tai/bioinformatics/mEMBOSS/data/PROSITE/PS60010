* Assassin bug toxin signature *
********************************

Assassin bugs  (Arthropoda:Insecta:Hemiptera:Reduviidae),  sometimes  known as
conenoses or  'kissing  bugs',  are  one  of  the  largest and morphologically
diverse families  of  true  bugs  feeding  on crickets, caterpillars and other
insects. Some assassin bug species are bloodsucking parasites of mammals, even
of human.  They  can  be commonly found throughout most of the world and their
size varies  from a few millimeters to as much as 3 or 4 centimeters [E1]. The
toxic saliva  of  the  predatory  assassin  bugs contains a complex mixture of
small and  large  peptides  for  diverse  uses  such  as immobilizing and pre-
digesting their  prey, and defense against competitors and predators. Assassin
bug toxins  are  small  peptides  with disulfide connectivity that target ion-
channels. They  are  relatively  homologous  to  the  calcium channel blockers
omega-conotoxins (see  <PDOC60004>)  from marine cone snails and belong to the
four-loop cysteine scaffold structural class [1,2].

One of  these  small  proteins,  Ptu1,  blocks  reversibly  the N-type calcium
channels, but at the same time is less specific for the L- or P/Q-type calcium
channels [1].  Ptu1  is  34  amino acid residues long and is cross-linked by 3
disulfide bridges.  Ptu1  contains  a beta-sheet region made of 2 antiparallel
beta-strands and  consists  of a compact disulfide-bonded core from which four
loops emerge as well as N- and C-termini (see <PDB:1I26; A>) [2].

Some assassin bug toxins are listed below:

 - Agriosphodrus dohrni toxin Ado1.
 - Isyndus obscurus toxin Iob1.
 - Peirates turpis toxin Ptu1.

The signature pattern for assassin bug toxins contains six conserved cysteines
involved in disulfide bonds within a knottin scaffold [E2].

-Consensus pattern: C-[LI]-x(2)-G-[SA]-x-C-x-G-x(2)-K-x-C-C-x(4,5)-C-x(2)-Y-A-
                    N-[RK]-C
                    [The 6 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
