* SAM domain profile *
**********************

The sterile  alpha motif (SAM) domain is a putative protein interaction module
present in  a  wide  variety  of  proteins  [1]  involved  in  many biological
processes. The  SAM  domain  that  spreads over around 70 residues is found in
diverse eukaryotic  organisms  [2].  SAM  domains have been shown to homo- and
hetero-oligomerize [3],  nevertheless with a low-affinity constant [4], and to
mediate specific protein-protein interactions.

Structural analyses show that the SAM domain is arranged in a small five-helix
bundle with  two  large  interfaces  [3,4].   In the case of the SAM domain of
EphB2, each  of  these  interfaces is able to form dimers [4]. The presence of
these two  distinct  intermonomers binding surface suggest that SAM could form
extended polymeric structures [4].

Some of  the  proteins  in  which  such  a domain is known to exist are listed
below.

 - Vertebrate Eph receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Involved in developmental
   regulation.
 - Yeast  STE11,  serine/threonine protein kinase which participates in mating
   pheromone response pathways.
 - Mammalian  liprin  alpha. Interacts with LAR transmembrane protein tyrosine
   phosphatase.
 - Mammalian  Neurabin  actin  filament  binding  protein. Involved in neurite
   formation.
 - Mammalian inositol phosphatase protein Ship2.
 - Mammalian  SH2  domain-containing  leukocyte  Protein  of  76kDa  (SLP-76).
   Hematopoietic cell specific molecule, critical for T cell development.
 - Mammalian ETS translocation variant (ETV) or TEL. Translocations which fuse
   the SAM  domain  from  ETV to Abl, PDGFB, JAK2 or AML1 have been associated
   with many human leukemias.
 - Drosophila  polyhomeotic  (ph)  and Sex comb on midleg (Scm), member of the
   Polycomb group genes, implied in the transcriptional repression of homeotic
   genes.
 - Mammalian   Polycomb  group  proteins  Rae-28/MPH1 and SCML1. Homologues of
   drosophila ph and Scm proteins.

We developed a profile that spans the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
