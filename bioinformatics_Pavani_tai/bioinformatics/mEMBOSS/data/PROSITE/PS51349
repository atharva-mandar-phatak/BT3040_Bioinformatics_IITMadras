* FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase signature and profile *
************************************************************************

A  number  of  oxidoreductases  that  act on alpha-hydroxy acids and which are
FMN-containing  flavoproteins  have  been  shown  [1,2,3,4] to be structurally
related; these enzymes are:

 - Lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.3),   which  consists  of  a  dehydrogenase
   domain and a heme-binding domain  called  cytochrome b2 and which catalyzes
   the conversion of lactate into pyruvate.
 - Glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) ((S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase), a peroxisomal
   enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of  glycolate and oxygen to glyoxylate
   and hydrogen peroxide.
 - Long chain alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase from rat (EC 1.1.3.15), a peroxisomal
   enzyme.
 - Lactate 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.4) (lactate oxidase) from Mycobacterium
   smegmatis, which catalyzes the conversion of lactate and oxygen to acetate,
   carbon dioxide and water.
 - (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase  from  Pseudomonas  putida  (gene mdlB),  which
   catalyzes the reduction of (S)-mandelate to benzoylformate.

The  first  step in the reaction mechanism of these enzymes is the abstraction
of  the  proton  from  the alpha-carbon of the substrate producing a carbanion
which can subsequently attach to the N5 atom of FMN. A conserved histidine has
been  shown [5] to be involved in the removal of the proton. We selected for a
signature  pattern the region around this active site residue, which is highly
conserved  and  contains  an  arginine  residue which is involved in substrate
binding.  Three-dimensional  structures  of  FMN-dependent  alpha-hydroxy acid
dehydrogenases   show   a  common  fold  with  a  TIM  barrel  structure  (see
<PDB:1TB3>).  We  also  developed a profile that covers the entire FMN hydroxy
acid dehydrogenase domain.

-Consensus pattern: S-N-H-G-[AG]-R-Q
                    [H is the active site residue]
                    [R is a substrate-binding residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
