* RNA polymerases D / 30 to 40 Kd subunits signature *
******************************************************

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing different sets of genes.  Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

It has  been  shown  [1,2,3] that small subunits of about 30 to 40 Kd found in
all three types of eukaryotic polymerases are highly conserved. Subunits known
to belong to this family are:

 - Budding yeast RPC5 subunit (or RPC40) from RNA polymerases I and III.
 - Mammalian RPA40 from RNA polymerase I.
 - Budding yeast RPB3 subunit from RNA polymerase II.
 - Fission yeast rpb3 subunit from RNA polymerase II.
 - Mammalian RPB3 (or RPB33) (gene POLR2C) from RNA polymerase II.
 - Conjugation stage-specific protein cnjC from Tetrahymena thermophila, which
   may be a stage-specific RNA polymerase subunit.
 - Archebacterial RNA polymerase subunit D (gene rpoD).

As a  signature  pattern for these subunits, we selected a conserved region in
their N-terminal part.

-Consensus pattern: N-[SGAT]-[LIVMF]-R-R-x(9)-[SAR]-x(3)-[VA]-x(4)-N-x-[STA]-
                    x(3)-[DN]-E-x-[LIV]-[GSA]-x-R-[LI]-[GAS]-[LIVM](2)-[PV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
