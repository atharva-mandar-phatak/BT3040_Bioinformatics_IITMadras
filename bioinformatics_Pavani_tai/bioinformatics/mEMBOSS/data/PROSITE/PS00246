* Wnt-1 family signature *
**************************

Wnt-1 (previously  known  as  int-1)  [1]  is  a proto-oncogene induced by the
integration of  the mouse mammary tumor virus. It is thought to play a role in
intercellular communication and seems to be a signalling molecule important in
the development  of the central nervous system (CNS). The sequence of wnt-1 is
highly conserved in mammals, fish, and amphibians.

Wnt-1 is  a  member of a large family of related proteins [2,3,4] that are all
thought to  be  developmental  regulators.  These  proteins are known as wnt-2
(also known as irp), wnt-3 up to wnt-15. At least four members of  this family
are present  in  Drosophila;  one  of  them,  wingless  (wg), is implicated in
segmentation polarity.

All these  proteins  share the following features characteristics of secretory
proteins: a  signal  peptide,  several  potential N-glycosylation sites and 22
conserved cysteines  that  are  probably  involved in disulfide bonds. The Wnt
proteins seem  to adhere to the plasma membrane of the secreting cells and are
therefore likely to signal over only few cell diameters.

Signal transduction by the Wnt family of ligands is mediated by the binding to
the extracellular  domain  fz of Frizzled receptors. It can lead to either the
activation of   dishvelled  proteins,  inhibition  of  GSK-3  kinase,  nuclear
accumulation of  beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes or be coupled
to the inositol signaling pathway and PKC activation, depending on the type of
Frizzled receptor [5,6].

We selected a highly conserved region including three cysteines as a signature
for this family of proteins.
