* ABC transporter integral membrane type-1 domain profiles *
************************************************************

ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
uses  the  hydrolysis  of ATP to energize diverse biological import and export
systems  (see  <PDOC00185>). ABC transporters are minimally constituted of two
conserved  regions:  a  highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less
conserved  transmembrane  domain (TMD). These regions can be found on the same
protein  (mostly  in  eukaryotes  and bacterial exporters) or on two different
ones  (mostly  bacterial  importers)  [1,2,3].  The  function  of the integral
inner-membrane  protein  is  to translocate the substrate across the membrane.
Studies  of P-glycoprotein function indicate that residues lining the proposed
chamber  opening  (residues  of  TM2,  TM5  and TM6) play an important role in
substrate recognition [4].

In  exporters and eukaryotes, ABC transporters consist of a single polypeptide
composed  of  an  N-terminal  domain of approximately 320 residues, apparently
containing  six transmembrane segments, fused to a highly conserved ABC-ATPase
domain  of  approximately  260  residues  [5,6,7]. In some cases an N-terminal
peptidase  domain of 130-150 residues appended to the TMD is also found, which
may contain additional transmembrane segments as in the HlyB subfamily [8,9].

The  3D  structure of the E. coli lipid A flippase MsbA homodimer reveals that
association  of  the  two transmembrane domains forms one chamber that adopt a
cone-shape  which  extends  along  a pseudo two-fold axis perpendicular to the
cell membrane (see <PDB:1JSQ>) [10]. The chamber has an opening on either side
of  the  membrane  to  provide  free access  for  the lipid substrate from the
cytoplasmic  leaflet  of the lipid bilayer, while excluding molecules from the
outer leaflet. The chamber openings are defined by intramolecular interactions
between  TM2  of  one  monomer  and  TM5 of the other. The residues lining the
chamber are contributed by all 12 transmembrane alpha-helices [10,11].

In  importers  (found  only  in  prokaryotes or archaea) most ABC transporters
consist  of  four domains usually encoded by independent polypeptides, two ABC
modules  and  two  TMDs which are thought to contain six transmembrane regions
[12,13]. The approximately 30 kD TMD displays a distinctive signature, the EAA
motif,  a 20 amino acid conserved sequence located about 100 residues from the
C-terminus.  The  motif  is  hydrophilic  and  has  been  found to reside in a
cytoplasmic  loop  located  between  the  penultimate  and the antepenultimate
transmembrane  segment  in  all  proteins with a known topology [14,15,16]. It
appears  to  play  an  important  role in ensuring the correct assembly of the
prokaryotic  ABC  transport  complex [17] and constituting an interaction site
with  the  so-called  helical  domain of the ABC module [18,19]. The TMDs form
either   homo-oligomeric  channels  or  associate  with  another  TMD  to form
hetero-oligomers.

The  3D  structure  of  the  E. coli  BtuCD proteins  has been solved [20]. It
consists  of two copies of the transmembrane domain BtuC and two copies of the
ATPase   BtuD   (see   <PDB:1L7V>).  Each  BtuC  subunit  is  composed  of  10
alpha-helices, rather than the six of MsbA, and these are packed together in a
more  intricated  manner than MsbA. Helices two-five and seven-ten are related
by  a  pseudo-two-fold  rotation  axis,  while  helices one and six are nearly
perpendicular  to  the  plane  of the membrane. The prominent cytoplasmic loop
between  helices  six and seven folds into two short helices, L1 and L2, which
make  extensive  contacts  with  BtuC. The conserved sequence within the L1-L2
region may represent a general interface between the TMD and NBD [11,20].

During  the transport cycle a conformational change involved by the NBD domain
has  been  described for this two kinds of transmembrane domains like those of
Pgp and MalFGK2 complex [21,22].

Integral membrane components of ABC complex have been shown to be evolutionary
related  and proteins known to belong to this family are classified in several
functional  subfamilies  depending  on  the substrate used [E1]. All different
types   of  transporters  with  a  functional  attribution  are  listed  below
(references are only provided for recently characterized proteins).

 - Antigen  peptide  transporters  1  (TAP1,  PSF1,  RING4, HAM-1, mtp1) and 2
   (TAP2, PSF2,  RING11, HAM-2, mtp2), which  are involved in the transport of
   antigens from      the   cytoplasm  to  a  membrane-bound  compartment  for
   association with MHC class I molecules.
 - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),  which  is most
   probably involved in the transport of chloride ions.
 - Drosophila  proteins  white  (w)  and brown (bw), which are involved in the
   import of ommatidium screening pigments.
 - Fungal elongation factor 3 (EF-3).
 - Multidrug   transporters  (Mdr1)  (P-glycoprotein),  a  family  of  closely
   related proteins which extrude a wide variety of drugs out of the cell.
 - 70 Kd peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70).
 - Sulfonylurea  receptor,  a  putative  subunit  of the B-cell  ATP-sensitive
   potassium channel.

We  have  developed two profiles to distinguish between these two kinds of ABC
transmembrane  domains. The  first  one recognizes the TMD in protein families
where TMD  and  NBD are on separate proteins. The second one picks up proteins
where TMD  and NBD are fused. Both profiles cover the entire six transmembrane
region.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  profiles  replace  a  pattern  (PS00402)  whose  specificity was
 inadequate.

-Last update: November 2003 / Pattern removed, profiles added and text revised.
