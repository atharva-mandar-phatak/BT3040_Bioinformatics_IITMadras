* Class IV SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
*************************************************************

Methyltransferases  (EC  2.1.1.-)  constitute  an  important  class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy)  and  a  methylated  molecule.  The substrates that are methylated by
these  enzymes  cover  virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules,  to  lipids,  proteins  and  nucleic  acids. Methyltransferases are
therefore   involved   in   many   essential   cellular   processes  including
biosynthesis,  signal  transduction,  protein repair, chromatin regulation and
gene  silencing  [1,2,3].  More  than  230  different  enzymatic  reactions of
methyltransferases  have been described so far, of which more than 220 use SAM
as  the  methyl  donor  [E1].  A  review  published  in  2003  [2] divides all
methyltransferases  into  5  classes based on the structure of their catalytic
domain (fold):
 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta     see <PDOC51555>
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta       see <PDOC51565>
A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:
 - class VI:   transmembrane			all alpha      see <PDOC51598>
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

Up-to-date  methyltransferases  classified  as Class IV (SPOUT) are homodimers
and  methylate  only  RNA.  The  common  core  of  the  SPOUT  fold contains a
five-stranded beta sheet, flanked by two layers of alpha helices. The core can
be  divided  into  two subdomains, both displaying an alpha/beta architecture:
(1) the N-terminal strands exhibit a Rossmanoidal alpha/beta fold while (2) an
important  part  of  the  C-terminal  (~  30 residues) is tucked back into the
structure  forming  a  conserved  topological  trefoil  knot where SAM binding
occurs.  The  active  site,  located  at the interface of the two subunits, is
formed  by  amino  acids  from  both  monomers  [2,4]. The ribosomal RNA large
subunit  methyltransferase H (EC 2.1.1.77) from Staphylococcus aureus contains
only  the  SPOUT  fold  core  elements  (see <PDB:1VH0>) [4] but most Class IV
methyltransferases  such  as  the 23S rRNA (guanosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase
RlmB  (EC  2.1.1.185)  from Escherichia coli (see <PDB:1GZ0>) contain an extra
alpha/beta module to the N-terminal subdomain [2,4].

Some enzymatic activities known to belong to the Class IV superfamily:

 - TRM10   methyltransferases:  tRNA  (guanine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase  (EC
   2.1.1.221), tRNA (adenine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.218) and RNA
   (guanine-9-)-methyltransferase domain-containing protein (EC 2.1.1.-).
 - TrmH  methyltransferases:  tRNA  (guanosine(18)-2'-O)-methyltransferase (EC
   2.1.1.34),  16S  rRNA (guanine(527)-N(7))-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.170),
   23S   rRNA   (guanine(2251)-2'-O)-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.185),  tRNA
   (cytidine(32)/uridine(32)-2'-O)-methyltransferase   (EC   2.1.1.200),  tRNA
   (cytidine(34)-2'-O)-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.207)  and other tRNA/rRNA
   methyltransferases.

The profiles we developed to identify Class IV SAM-dependent methyltransferases
families are directed against whole length proteins.
