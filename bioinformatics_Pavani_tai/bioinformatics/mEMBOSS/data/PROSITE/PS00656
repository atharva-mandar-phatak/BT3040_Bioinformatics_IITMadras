* Glycosyl hydrolases family 6 signatures *
*******************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family B [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 6  [4,E1].    The  enzymes  which are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Agaricus bisporus exoglucanase 3 (cel3).
 - Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase A (cenA).
 - Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase A (cbhA).
 - Microspora bispora endoglucanase A (celA).
 - Streptomyces halstedii endoglucanases A (celA1).
 - Streptomyces strain KSM-9 endoglucanase 1 (casA).
 - Thermomonospora fusca endoglucanase E-2 (celB).
 - Trichoderma reesei exoglucanase II (CBH2).

One of the conserved regions in  these  enzymes  contains a conserved aspartic
acid  residue  which is  potentially  involved [5] in the catalytic mechanism;
the aspartate is  followed by a cysteine which is involved in a disulfide bond
[6]. A second conserved region contains an aspartate which seems [5] to be the
proton donor  in  the  catalytic mechanism.   We  have  used  both  regions as
signature patterns.

                    [D may be an active site residue]
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for celA1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
