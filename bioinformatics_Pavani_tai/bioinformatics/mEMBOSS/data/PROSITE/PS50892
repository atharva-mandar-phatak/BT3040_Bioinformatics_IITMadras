* v-SNARE coiled-coil homology domain profile *
***********************************************

The process  of  vesicular  membrane  fusion  in eukaryotic cells depends on a
conserved fusion  machinery  called  SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
factor (NSF)  attachment  protein (SNAP) receptors). In the process of vesicle
docking, proteins  present  on  the  vesicle  (v-SNARE)  have to bind to their
counterpart  on the target membrane (t-SNARE)  to form a core complex that can
then recruit  the soluble proteins NSF and SNAP. This so called fusion complex
can then  disassemble  after  ATP  hydrolysis  mediated by the ATPase NSF in a
process that leads to membrane fusion and the release of the vesicle contents.
v-SNAREs include proteins homologous to synaptobrevin [1,2,3].

Structurally the  SNARE  complex is generally a four-helix bundle comprised of
three coiled-coil-forming domains from t-SNAREs (see <PDOC50192>) and one from
v-SNARE (see  <PDB:1GL2>).  Although sequence similarity in the t- and v-SNARE
coiled-coil homology  domains  are low there is a striking conservation of the
so-called heptad repeat that is of central importance in forming a coiled-coil
structure. In  a  coiled-coil  motif,  seven  residues  constitute a canonical
heptad and  are designated 'a' through 'g', with 'a' and 'd' being occupied by
hydrophobic residues.  The  association of the four alpha-helices in the SNARE
fusion complex structure produces highly conserved layers of interacting amino
acid side  chains  in  the  center of the four-helix bundle. The center of the
bundle is  made  up of 15 hydrophobic layers from the 'a' and 'd' positions of
the heptad    repeats  of the coiled-coil-forming domains, whereas the central
'ionic' layer  is highly conserved and polar in nature, containing a glutamine
residue in  the  three  t-SNAREs  and  an  arginine  in the v-SNARE, hence the
classification of   v-  and  t-SNAREs as R- and Q-SNAREs, respectively. The v-
SNARE coiled-coil homology domain is around 60 amino acids in length [1,2,3].

The profile  we  developed  cover  the  entire  v-SNARE  coiled-coil  homology
domain.
