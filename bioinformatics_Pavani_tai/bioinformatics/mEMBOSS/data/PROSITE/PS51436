* Potyvirus NIa protease (NIa-pro) domain profile *
***************************************************

Tobacco etch  virus  (TEV),  tomato  vein  mottling virus (TVMV), and plum pox
virus (PPV)  are  members of the Potyviridae family [E1]. The potyvirus genome
is a  (+)  stranded  RNA  and  is  translated  into  a single polyprotein upon
infection, which is processed by the virally encoded proteases P1, HC-Pro, and
NIa. Most  of  the  cleavage  events  are  performed by NIa (nuclear inclusion
protein a)  protease  (NIa-pro).  NIa-pro processes seven sites present in the
potyvirus polyprotein,  named  as  A,  B, C, D, V, E, and F. NIa-pros obtained
from potyviruses  have similar structures and functions. The potyvirus NIa-pro
has a  His-Asp-Cys  catalytic  triad,  which is homologous to the trypsin-like
proteases (see  <PDOC00124>)  except  for Cys replacing Ser. NIa-pros obtained
from potyviruses  share  certain  sequence  identities; however they recognize
distinct amino  acid  sequences  at each recognition sites. Consequently, they
cannot recognize  the  cleavage  sites  of each other efficiently [1]. Nia-pro
belongs to  peptidase  family  C4  [E2]. In addition to the catalytic activity
NIa-pro possesses  also  sequence  non-specific  RNA-binding  activity and RNA
polymerase (NIb) binding activity [3].

The potyvirus  NIa  protein contains the following two domains; the VPg domain
at the  N-terminus  and  the NIa-pro domain at the C-terminus [1,2]. The ~250-
amino acid  NIaPro  domain  adopts  the characteristic two-domain antiparallel
beta-barrel fold  that  is the hallmark of trypsin-like serine proteases, with
the catalytic  triad  residues  His,  Asp,  and  Cys  located at the interface
between domains (see <PDB:1LVM>) [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire potyvirus NIa-pro domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: August 2011 / First entry.
