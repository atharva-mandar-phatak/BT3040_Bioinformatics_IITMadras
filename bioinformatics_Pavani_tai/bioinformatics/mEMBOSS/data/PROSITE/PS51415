* Xylose isomerase family profile *
***********************************

Xylose  isomerase  (EC 5.3.1.5) [1] is an enzyme found in microorganisms which
catalyzes  the  interconversion  of  an  aldo  sugar  D-xylose to a keto sugar
D-xylulose.  It  can  also  isomerize  D-ribose to D-ribulose and D-glucose to
D-fructose.  Xylose  isomerase  seems  to  require magnesium for its activity,
while cobalt is necessary to stabilize the tetrameric structure of the enzyme.

Xylose  isomerase  also  exists in plants [2] where it is manganese-dependent.
The enzyme has also been found in anaerobic fungi [3].

A number of residues are conserved in all known xylose isomerases. A histidine
in  the  N-terminal section of the enzyme has been shown [4] to be involved in
the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Two glutamate residues, a histidine and
four  aspartate  residues  are  the  metal-binding sites that bind two ions of
magnesium, cobalt, or manganese [5-7].

Three-dimensional  structures  of  xylose  isomerases show a that each subunit
contains  a  common  alpha/beta-barrel fold (see <PDB:2GLK; A>) [7] similar to
that  of  other  divalent metal-dependent TIM barrel enzymes, such as rhamnose
isomerase  [8]  and  endonuclease  4 (see <PDOC00599>) [1,5,6]. The C-terminal
smaller  part  forms  an  extended helical fold that seems to be implicated in
multimerization.

We have developed a profile that covers the entire xylose isomerase structure.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
