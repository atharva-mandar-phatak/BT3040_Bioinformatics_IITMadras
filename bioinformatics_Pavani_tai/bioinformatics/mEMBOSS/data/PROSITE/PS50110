**************************************
* Response regulatory domain profile *
**************************************

Most prokaryotic signal-transduction systems and a few eukaryotic pathways use
phosphotransfer schemes   involving  two  conserved  components,  a  histidine
protein kinase  (HK)  (see <PDOC50109>) and a response regulator protein (RR).
The HK,  which  is regulated by environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a
histidine residue,   creating   a   high-energy   phosphoryl   group  that  is
subsequently transferred  to  an aspartate residue in the RR. Most RRs consist
of two  domains:  a  conserved  N-terminal regulatory domain and a variable C-
terminal effector  domain.  Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain induces a
conformational change  that results in activation of an associated domain that
effects the  response.  The  regulatory  domains of RRs have three activities.
First they  interact  with  phosphorylated  HKs  and  catalyze  transfer  of a
phosphoryl group  to  one  of  their  own  Asp residues. Second, they catalyze
autodephosphorylation. And  finally  they  regulate  the  activities  of their
associated effector   domains   in  a  phosphorylation-dependent  manner.  The
regulatory domains,  often  called  receiver domains, can also be found within
hybrid histidine kinases or as isolated proteins within phosphorelay pathways.
In these  contexts,  the  receiver  domains  are  not  physically connected to
effector domains  and  play  no  direct  role  in  regulating  effector domain
function.

The RR  domain  has a doubly wound five-stranded alpha/beta fold consisting of
about 125  residues  (see  <PDB:2CHY>).  This  fold  consists  a central five-
stranded parallel  beta  sheet flanked on both faces by five amphipathic alpha
helices. Residues that are highly conserved in all RR domains are clustered in
two regions:  an  active-site  cleft  formed  by loops that extend from the C-
terminal ends  of  beta strands 1, 3 and 5, and a pair of residues that form a
diagonal path  extending  across the molecule from the active site. The active
site is  a conserved acidic pocket and contains the phosphorylatable aspartate
residue [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire RR domain.
