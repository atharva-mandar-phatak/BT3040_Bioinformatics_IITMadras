* Aminotransferases class-III pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site *
*******************************************************************

Aminotransferases  share certain mechanistic features with   other  pyridoxal-
phosphate dependent enzymes, such as  the  covalent  binding of the pyridoxal-
phosphate group  to  a  lysine  residue.  On the basis of sequence similarity,
these various  enzymes  can  be  grouped [1,2] into subfamilies. One of these,
called class-III, currently consists of the following enzymes:

 - Acetylornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.11) which catalyzes the transfer
   of an amino group  from  acetylornithine  to  alpha-ketoglutarate, yielding
   N-acetyl-glutamic-5-semi-aldehyde and glutamic acid.
 - Ornithine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13),  which  catalyzes the transfer of
   an amino group from  ornithine to alpha-ketoglutarate, yielding glutamic-5-
   semi-aldehyde and glutamic acid.
 - Omega-amino acid--pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.18), which  catalyzes
   transamination between a variety  of omega-amino acids, mono- and diamines,
   and pyruvate. It plays a pivotal role in omega amino acids metabolism.
 - 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase  (EC 2.6.1.19) (GABA transaminase),  which
   catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from  GABA to alpha-ketoglutarate,
   yielding succinate semialdehyde and glutamic acid.
 - DAPA aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.62), a bacterial  enzyme (gene bioA)  which
   catalyzes an   intermediate  step  in   the  biosynthesis  of  biotin,  the
   transamination  of  7-keto-8-aminopelargonic  acid  (7-KAP)  to   form 7,8-
   diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA).
 - 2,2-dialkylglycine  decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.64),  a   Pseudomonas  cepacia
   enzyme (gene dgdA) that  catalyzes  the decarboxylating  amino  transfer of
   2,2-dialkylglycine and  pyruvate  to  dialkyl  ketone,  alanine  and carbon
   dioxide.
 - Glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (EC 5.4.3.8) (GSA).  GSA  is  the
   enzyme involved in  the second step  of  porphyrin biosynthesis, via the C5
   pathway. It  transfers    the  amino  group  on  carbon  2  of glutamate-1-
   semialdehyde to the neighbouring carbon, to give delta-aminolevulinic acid.
 - Bacillus subtilis aminotransferase yhxA.
 - Bacillus subtilis aminotransferase yodT.
 - Haemophilus influenzae aminotransferase HI0949.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans aminotransferase T01B11.2.

The sequence around the pyridoxal-phosphate  attachment site  of this class of
enzyme is sufficiently conserved to allow the creation of a specific pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYWCS]-[LIVMFYWCAH]-x-D-[ED]-[IVA]-x(2,3)-[GAT]-
                    [LIVMFAGCYN]-x(0,1)-[RSACLIH]-x-[GSADEHRM]-x(10,16)-[DH]-
                    [LIVMFCAG]-[LIVMFYSTAR]-x(2)-[GSA]-K-x(2,3)-[GSTADNV]-
                    [GSAC]
                    [K is the pyridoxal-P attachment site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
