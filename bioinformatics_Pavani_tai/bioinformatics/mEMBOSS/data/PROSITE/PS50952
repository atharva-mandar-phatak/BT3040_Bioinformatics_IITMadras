* KIX domain profile *
**********************

Transcriptional activators  are  believed  to  stimulate  gene  expression via
protein-protein interactions  with  the  basal  machinery.  The cAMP-regulated
transcription factor  CREB has been shown to stimulate target gene expression,
in part  by  associating  with  the coactivator paralogs p300 and CREB binding
protein (CBP).  CBP  and  P300  bind  to  the  Ser-133-phosphorylated  kinase-
inducible domain (KID) (see <PDOC50953>) of CREB via a region of approximately
90 residues  referred  to  as the KIX domain, which is highly conserved in CBP
homologs from  Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In addition
to CREB,  the KIX domain of CBP also recognizes the transactivation domains of
other nuclear  factors,  including  Myb,  Jun, cubitus interruptus, and HTLV-1
virally encoded  Tax  protein.  Thus  the  KIX  domain  appears to be a common
docking site  on  CBP  for  many transcriptional activators. The KIX domain is
found in  association  with  other  domains,  such  as  the  bromodomain  (see
<PDOC00550>), the  ZZ-type zinc finger (see <PDOC50135>), or the TAZ-type zinc
finger (see <PDOC50134>) [1,2].

The KIX domain of CBP is composed of three mutually interacting alpha helices,
designated alpha1,  alpha2  and alpha3, and two short 3(10) helices G1 and G2,
that together  with  the  interconnecting  loops  define  a compact structural
domain with  an extensive hydrophobic core (see <PDB:1KDX; A>). Helices alpha1
and alpha3  constitute  the primary interacting surface for the phosphorylated
KID domain  (pKID), forming a hydrophobic patch on the protein surface that is
large enough  to  accommodate  up  to  3  turns of an amphipathic alpha helix,
designated alphaB,  in  pKID  (see  <PDB:1KDX>). A second alpha helix in pKID,
referred to  as alphaA, interacts with a different face of the alpha3 helix of
KIX. The  two  helices of pKID are arranged at an angle of about 90 degree and
essentially wrap around the alpha3 helix of KIX [1,2].

The profile we developed spans the entire KIX domain.
