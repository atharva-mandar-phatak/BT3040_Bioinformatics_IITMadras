* SOCS box domain profile *
***************************

The SOCS  box domain was first identified in SH2-domain-containing proteins of
the suppressor  of  cytokines  signaling (SOCS) family [1] but was latter also
found in:

 - The WSB (WD-40-repeat-containing proteins with a SOCS box) family,
 - The SSB (SPRY domain-containing proteins with a SOCS box) family,
 - The ASB (Ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins with a SOCS box) family,
 - The RAR (GTPase domain and SOCS box-containing proteins) family [2].

The SOCS  box found in these proteins is a C-terminal domain of about 50 amino
acids composed of two blocks of well-conserved residues separated by between 2
to 10    nonconserved    residues  [2].  The  C-terminal conserved region is a
Leu/Pro-rich sequence  of  unknown  function, whereas the N-terminal conserved
region is called a 'BC box' [3] and binds to the elongin BC complex [3,4].  It
has been  proposed  that  this  association could couple bound proteins to the
ubiquitination or proteasomal compartments [4].

Some proteins known to contain a SOCS box domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  cytokine-inducible  SH2-containing  (CIS)  protein. This protein
   belongs to  the  SOCS  family and inhibits erythropoietin and interleukin 3
   receptor signaling  by competing with signaling molecules such as STATs for
   binding to phosphorylated receptor cytoplasmic domains.
 - Mammalian   SOCS-1  protein.  This  protein  is  a  negative  regulator  of
   interleukin 6 signaling. It acts by binding to and inhibiting the catalytic
   activity of members of the JAK family of cytoplasmic kinases.
 - Vertebrate WSB-1.

The profile we developed covers the entire SOCS box domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
