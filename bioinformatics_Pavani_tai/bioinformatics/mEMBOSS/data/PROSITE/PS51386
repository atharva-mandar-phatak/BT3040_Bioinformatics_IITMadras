******************************
* RINT1/TIP20 domain profile *
******************************

The following  proteins  playing  a  role  in  anterograde  transport from the
endoplasmic reticulum  (ER)  to the Golgi and/or retrograde transport from the
Golgi to the ER share sequence similarity:

 - Mammalian   RINT1  (Rad50-interacting  protein  1),  which  was  originally
   discovered as  a  checkpoint  protein that interacts with Rad50 only during
   late S  and  G2/M phases. RINT1 also functions in membrane trafficking from
   the endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)  to  the Golgi complex in interphase cells
   [1-3].
 - Yeast  TIP20,  which  has  been  reported  to be involved in the retrograde
   transport from the Golgi to the ER [4].
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  MAIGO2 (MAG2), functions in the transport of storage
   protein precursors between the ER and Golgi complex in plants [5].

They share  a  similar  domain  organization with an N-terminal leucine heptad
repeat rich  coiled  coil  and  an ~500-residue C-terminal RINT1/TIP20 domain,
which might   be  a  protein-protein  interaction  module  necessary  for  the
formation of functional complexes.

The profile we developed covers the entire RINT1/TIP20 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
