**********************************************************************

Tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) catalyzes the last step in  the biosynthesis
of  tryptophan:  the  conversion  of  indoleglycerol  phosphate and serine, to
tryptophan and   glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  [1,2].  It  has  two  functional
domains: one for  the aldol cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate to indole and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and  the other for the synthesis of tryptophan from
indole and  serine.  In  bacteria  and  plants  [3], each domain is found on a
separate subunit (alpha and beta chains),  while  in fungi the two domains are
fused together on a single multifunctional protein.

The beta chain of the  enzyme requires  pyridoxal-phosphate as a cofactor. The
pyridoxal-phosphate group is attached to a lysine residue.   The region around
this lysine residue also contains two histidine residues which are part of the
pyridoxal-phosphate binding  site.    The signature pattern for the tryptophan
synthase beta chain is derived from that conserved region.
