* Birnavirus VP4 protease domain profile *
******************************************

Viruses of  the  Birnaviridae  family  [E1] infect animal species belonging to
vertebrates, mollusks, insects and rotifers and are characterized by their bi-
segmented double-stranded RNA genome (segments A and B). Segment A encodes two
overlapping reading  frames  and  the  larger  open  reading  frame  encodes a
polyprotein (NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH).  The polyprotein is processed through the
proteolytic activity  of  VP4  to generate pVP2 and VP3. During virus assembly
pVP2 is  further  processed  by  VP4  to  generate  the capsid protein VP2 and
structural peptides.  Evolutionarily,  the  VP4  protease  of the Birnaviridae
family belongs to clan SJ and family S50 [E2] [1,2,3].

The birnavirus  VP4 protease domain displays a catalytic serine/lysine dyad in
its active  site.  The  birnavirus  VP4 protease domain has an alpha/beta fold
(see <PDB:2PNL>) [2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire birnavirus VP4 protease domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: September 2011 / First entry.
