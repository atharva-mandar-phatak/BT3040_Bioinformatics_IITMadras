* Tachykinin family signature *
*******************************

Tachykinins [1,2,3] are  a group of biologically active peptides  which excite
neurons, evoke behavioral  responses, are potent vasodilatators  and  contract
(directly or  indirectly) many smooth muscles. Peptides known to belong to the
tachykinin family are listed below:

 - Substance P from mammals, birds and fish.
 - Neurokinin A (substance K or neuromedin L) from mammals, birds and fish.
 - Neurokinin B (neuromedin K) from mammals and frogs.
 - Kassinin from frogs.
 - Hylambatin from frogs.
 - Phyllomedusin from a frog.
 - Physalaemin from a frog.
 - Ranamargarin from a Chinese frog.
 - Uperolein from frogs.
 - Ranatachykinins A to D from frogs [4].
 - Scyliorhinins from dogfish.
 - Carassin from goldfish [5].
 - Eledoisin from octopus.

Tachykinins,  like  most  other  active  peptides, are  synthesized  as larger
protein  precursors that  are  enzymatically  converted to their mature forms.
Tachykinins  are  from ten  to  twelve residues  long.  We use, as a signature
pattern, the last five residues of the C-terminal, which are conserved and are
essential to the biological activity.

-Consensus pattern: F-[IVFY]-G-[LM]-M-[G>]
                    [See the note]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ranatachykinin D from Rana catesbeiana which  has Ala-Pro instead of Gly-
 Leu/Met.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 10.

-Note: If the  sequence  is  processed,  the  peptide  ends  with a C-terminal
 amidated Met while  in a precursor  sequence  it  is always followed by a Gly
 which subsequently provides the amide group.
-Note: Locust myotropic peptides locustatachykinin I and II [6] are  distantly
 related to the tachykinin family  but  their C-terminal sequence is different
 (Val-Arg instead of Leu/Met-Met). Thus, they  are  not  detected by the above
 pattern.
