****************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located  in  the inner mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there is  one  with a  molecular  weight  of 30 Kd (in mammals) which has been
found to be:

 - Nuclear encoded, as a precursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and
   in Neurospora crassa.
 - Mitochondrial  encoded in  Paramecium (protein P1), and in the  slime  mold
   Dictyostelium discoideum (ORF 209).
 - Chloroplast encoded in various higher plants (ORF 159).

It is also present in bacteria:

 - In the cyanobacteria Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 (gene ndhJ).
 - Subunit C of Escherichia coli NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoC).
 - Subunit NQO5 of Paracoccus denitrificans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.

This protein, in its mature form,  consists of  from  157  to  266  amino acid
residues.  The  best conserved region is located in the C-terminal section and
can be used as a signature pattern.
