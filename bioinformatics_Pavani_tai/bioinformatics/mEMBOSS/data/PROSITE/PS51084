* HIT domain signature and profile *
************************************

HIT  (histidine  triad)  proteins,  named  for  a  short  motif related to the
sequence  (His-x-His-x-His-x-x,  where x is a hydrophobic residue) [1,2] are a
superfamily  of  nucleotide  hydrolases  which  acts on the alpha-phosphate of
ribonucleotides  [3,4].  This  superfamily can be divided in two branches: the
Hint  branch  that is the most widely conserved and has representatives in all
cellular  life  and  the  Fhit (for “fragile histidine triad”) branch which is
only  found  in  animals  and  fungi.  The two branches share a conserved core
region of about 1oo amino acids, the HIT domain.

Crystal  structures  of  the  HINT-nucleotide  complexe  revealed that the HIT
domain  is  related to GalT nucleotide-binding proteins (see <PDOC00108>) (see
<PDB:3RHN>)  [3].  The  GalT monomer can be seen as consisting of two repeated
HIT  domains.  Their  nucleotide  binding  sites  also retain some of the same
residues  for  binding  a  nucleoside  monophosphate.  The  histidine triad is
located outside the nucleotide binding pocket and stabilize it.

Some proteins known to contain a HIT domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian protein HINT (also known as protein kinase C inhibitor 1 or PKCI-
   1). HINT  was incorrectly thought to be a specific inhibitor of PKC. It has
   been shown to bind zinc.
 - Fission   yeast   diadenosine   5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate   asymmetrical
   hydrolase  (Ap4Aase) (EC 3.6.1.17) (gene aph1), which cleaves A-5'-PPPP-5'A
   to yield AMP and ATP.
 - FHIT,  a  human protein whose gene is altered in different tumors and which
   acts as  a  diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P3-triphosphate hydrolase (Ap3Aase)
   (EC 3.6.1.29) cleaving A-5'-PPP-5'A to yield AMP and ADP.
 - Yeast proteins HNT1 and HNT2.
 - Maize zinc-binding protein ZBP14.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  ycfF and a related protein in all
   sequenced bacterial genomes and some archaeal genomes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F21C3.3.

As a signature pattern, we selected the region of the histidine triad. We also
developed a profile that covers the whole HIT domain.

-Consensus pattern: [NQAR]-x(4)-[GSAVY]-x-[QFLPA]-x-[LIVMY]-x-[HWYRQ]-
                    [LIVMFYST]-H-[LIVMFT]-H-[LIVMF]-[LIVMFPT]-[PSGAWN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
