* Adenosine and AMP deaminase signature *
*****************************************

Adenosine deaminase  (EC 3.5.4.4)  catalyzes  the  hydrolytic  deamination  of
adenosine into inosine.  AMP  deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6)  catalyzes the hydrolytic
deamination of AMP into IMP.  It  has  been  shown [1] that these two types of
enzymes  share  three  regions of  sequence  similarities; these  regions  are
centered on residues which are  proposed  to  play  an  important  role in the
catalytic mechanism  of  these two enzymes.  We  have  selected one  of  these
regions, it contains two conserved aspartic  acid  residues that are potential
active site residues.

-Consensus pattern: [SA]-[LIVM]-[NGS]-[STA]-D-D-P
                    [The 2 D's may be active site residues]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.
