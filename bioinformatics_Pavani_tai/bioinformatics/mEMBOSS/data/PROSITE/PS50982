* Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) profile *
*******************************************

Methylation at   CpG   dinucleotide,  the  most  common  DNA  modification  in
eukaryotes, has  been  correlated  with gene silencing associated with various
phenomena such   as   genomic   imprinting,   transposon   and   chromosome  X
inactivation, differenciation,  and  cancer.  Effects  of  DNA methylation are
mediated through  proteins  which  bind to symmetrically methylated CpGs. Such
proteins contain  a  specific  domain  of ~70 residues, the methyl-CpG-binding
domain (MBD), which is linked to additional domains associated with chromatin,
such as  the  bromodomain  (see <PDOC00550>), the AT hook motif,the SET domain
(see <PDOC50280>),   or  the  PHD  finger  (see  <PDOC50016>).  MBD-containing
proteins appear  to  act  as  structural  proteins, which recruit a variety of
histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and chromatin remodeling factors, leading
to chromatin  compaction and, consequently, to transcriptional repression. The
MBD of  MeCP2,  MBD1,  MBD2, MBD4 and BAZ2 mediates binding to DNA, in case of
MeCP2, MBD1  and  MBD2 preferentially to methylated CpG. In case of human MBD3
and SETDB1  the  MBD  has  been  shown to mediate protein-protein interactions
[1,2].

The MBD  folds  into  an  alpha/beta  sandwich structure comprising a layer of
twisted beta  sheet,  backed by another layer formed by the alpha1 helix and a
hairpin loop  at  the  C  terminus  (see  <PDB:1IG4>).  These  layers are both
amphipathic, with  the  alpha1 helix and the beta sheet lying parallel and the
hydrophobic faces tighly packed against each other. The beta sheet is composed
of two  long  inner  strands (beta2 and beta3) sandwiched by two shorter outer
strands (beta1 and beta4) [3].

Some protein known to contain a MBD domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate methyl-CpG binding proteins MBD1, a transcriptional regulator.
 - Vertebrate methyl-CpG binding proteins MBD2.
 - Vertebrate  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP-2 protein). It is implicated
   in a  human  neurological  disorder  called Rett syndrome. Symptoms of this
   syndrome are  mental  retardation,  loss of speech and purposeful hand use,
   autism, ataxia, and stereotypic hand movements.
 - Vertebrate  bromodomain  adjacent to zinc finger domain 2A (BAZ2A/TIP5). It
   is part  of  the  NoRC,  nucleolar remodeling complex, which represses rDNA
   transcription by  recruiting  histone  methyltransferases,  HDACs  and  DNA
   methyltransferases.
 - Vertebrate bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 2B (BAZ2B).
 - Vertebrate  histone-lysine  N-methyltransferase,  H3  lysine-9  specific  4
   (EC 2.1.1.43) (SETDB1).
 - Vertebrate   probable   histone-lysine   N-methyltransferase,  H3  lysine-9
   specific (EC 2.1.1.43) (SETDB2 or CLLD8).
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  AtMBD  1-12.  No  sequence homology is found between
   AtMBDs and mammalian MBDs outside the MBD motif.

The profile we developed covers the entire MBD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
