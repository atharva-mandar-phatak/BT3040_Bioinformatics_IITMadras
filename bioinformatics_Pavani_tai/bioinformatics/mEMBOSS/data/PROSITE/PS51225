* MARVEL domain profile *
*************************

The ~130-residue MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane
link (MARVEL)  domain is a module with a four transmembrane-helix architecture
that has  been  identified  in  proteins  of  the myelin and lymphocyte (MAL),
physins, gyrins  and occludin families. All described MARVEL domain-containing
proteins are  consistent  with the M-shaped topology: four transmembrane-helix
region architecture with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. Their function
could be  related  to cholesterol-rich membrane apposition events in a variety
of cellular  processes,  such as biogenesis of vesicular transport carriers or
tight junction regulation [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire MARVEL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: August 2006 / First entry.
