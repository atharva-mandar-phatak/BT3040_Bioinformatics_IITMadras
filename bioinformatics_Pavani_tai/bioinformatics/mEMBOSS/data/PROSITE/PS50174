* G-patch domain profile *
**************************

The G-patch domain is an approximately 48 amino acid domain, which is found in
a single  copy  in  several  RNA-associated  proteins and in type D retroviral
polyproteins. It  is  widespread among eukaryotes but is absent in archaea and
bacteria. The  G-patch  domain has been called after its most notable feature,
the presence  of six highly conserved glycine residues. The position following
the first  conserved  glycine  is  occupied  almost  invariably by an aromatic
residue, and  several  other  positions  are  occupied predominantly by either
hydrophobic or  small  residues. Several groups of G-patch containing proteins
are conserved  in  animals, plants and fungi. In some of these proteins the G-
patch is  the only recognizable domain but in most of them it is combined with
other domains,  which  include  well-defined  RNA-binding domains, such as the
RRM (see  <PDOC00030>),  dsRBD  (see  <PDOC50137>),  SURP and R3H. It has been
suggested that  the  G-patch  domain has a specific function in RNA processing
and, in  particular,  that  it  might  be  a previously undetected RNA-binding
domain mediating a distinct type of RNA-protein interaction.

Secondary structure  prediction  indicates  that  the  G-patch domain probably
contains two  alpha-helices,  with four out of the six glycines located within
an intervening loop.

Some proteins known to contain a G-patch domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic 45-kDa splicing factor (SPF-45).
 - Mammmalian SON protein, a DNA-binding protein.
 - Human  LUCA15,  a  multidomain RNA-binding protein that is the product of a
   gene deleted in certain lung tumors.
 - Human DAN26/EPROT, a multidomain protein, which, in addition to the G-patch
   domain, contains an RNA polymerase II C-terminal repeat-binding domain seen
   in many proteins of the polyA-addition machinery.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  DRT111,  a protein which has been shown to partially
   restore recombination  proficiency  and  DNA-damage  resistance  to E. coli
   mutants.
 - Type  D  retroviral polyprotein, where the G-patch domain is found directly
   downstream of the protease domain (see <PDOC00128>).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
