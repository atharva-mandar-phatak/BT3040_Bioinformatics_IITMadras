* Rho GTPase-binding/formin homology 3 (GBD/FH3) domain profile *
*****************************************************************

Formins are   multidomain   proteins   conserved  from  plants  to  fungi  and
vertebrates. Due  to  their  pivotal  role  in  the  organization of the actin
cytoskeleton formins  are  involved  in  processes  as diverse as formation of
filopodia, microspikes and lamellipodia, establishment and maintenance of cell
polarity, vesicular trafficking, formation of adherens junctions, cytokinesis,
embryonic development  and  signaling to the nucleus. Formins are defined by a
conserved formin  homology  2  (FH2)  domain  with  actin  nucleation activity
preceded by  a proline-rich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain. In most fungal and
metazoan formins  the  FH1-FH2  core  is  accompanied  by  a less conserved N-
terminal formin  homology  3  (FH3)  domain  involved  in  targeting  [1]. The
Diaphanous-related formins  are  able  to  interact with activated Rho GTPases
through a  poorly  defined  N-terminal  Rho  GTPase  binding domain (GBD) that
overlaps with  the  formin  homology 3 (FH3) domain. This binding releases the
intramolecular inhibitory   interaction  between  the  GBD  and  a  C-terminal
Diaphanous autoregulatory  domain  (DAD)  (see  <PDOC51231>)  and  renders the
protein active. It has been proposed that the GBD and FH3 domains constitute a
single domain  also found in Dictyostelium guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(RasGEFs) [2].

The GBD/FH3  domain  is approximately 380 residues in length. Its role appears
to be  twofold.  On  one  hand the N-terminal region of formins is involved in
subcellular localization  through  interaction  with  diverse targets. The low
degree of  sequence  conservation  of  this  region  might  correlate with the
diversity of   binding   partners,  not  only  Rho  GTPases,  and  subcellular
localization patterns.  On  the  other  hand the GBD/FH3 domain is involved in
regulation of activation by releasing of an intramolecular interaction between
the DAD  and  the  N-terminus  [2].  The  GBD/FH3 domain is exclusively alpha-
helical and  is  comprised  of  the  N-terminal  part of the GBD, an armadillo
repeat region (ARR) and dimerization subdomains (see <PDB:1Z2C>) [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire GBD/FH3 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
