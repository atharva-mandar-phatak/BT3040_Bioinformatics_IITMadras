* Hemopexin domain signature *
******************************

Hemopexin is a  serum glycoprotein that  binds  heme and transports it  to the
liver for breakdown and iron recovery, after  which the free hemopexin returns
to the circulation.  Structurally hemopexin consists of  two similar halves of
approximately two hundred  amino acid residues  connected  by a histidine-rich
hinge region. Each half is itself formed by the repetition of  a basic unit of
some 35 to 45 residues.  Hemopexin-like domains have  been found [1,2]  in two
other types of proteins:

 - In vitronectin, a cell  adhesion and spreading  factor  found in plasma and
   tissues. Vitronectin, like hemopexin, has two hemopexin-like domains.
 - In  most  members  of the matrix metalloproteinases family (matrixins) (see
   <PDOC00129>): MMP-1,  MMP-2,  MMP-3,  MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12,
   MMP-13, MMP-14,  MMP-15,  MMP-16,  MMP-17,  MMP-18, MMP-19, MMP-20, MMP-24,
   and MMP-25. These zinc endoproteases have a single hemopexin-like domain in
   their C-terminal section.

It is suggested that the  hemopexin domain facilitates binding to a variety of
molecules and proteins. The signature pattern for this type of domain has been
derived from the best  conserved region  which is  located at the beginning of
the second repeat.
