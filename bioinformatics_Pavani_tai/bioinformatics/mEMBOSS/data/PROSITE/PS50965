* NERD domain profile *
***********************

The nuclease-related  domain (NERD) is an about 117-amino acid module found in
a broad range of bacterial, as well as single archaeal and plant proteins. The
majority of  NERD-containing proteins are single-domain, in several cases with
additional (predicted)   transmembrane  helices.  In  only  a  few  instances,
proteins containing  NERD  domains have additional domains (mostly involved in
DNA processing),  such  as the HRDC, the UvrD/REP helicase, the DNA-binding C4
zinc finger   or   the  serine/threonine  and  tyrosine  protein  kinase  (see
<PDOC00100>). In  all  cases  in which a NERD domain is present in multidomain
proteins, it  is  found  at the N terminus. The NERD domain is predicted to be
connected to  DNA processing and genomic context and distant homology analysis
suggest a nuclease function [1].

The NERD  sequence  is  characterized  by three conserved regions among weakly
conserved or  very  diverse  regions.  Conserved hydrophobic, mainly aliphatic
motifs (consisting  of  Leu,  Ile and Val) and polar, mainly charged positions
(e.g. Asp, His, Glu and Lys) alternate. An interesting feature of NERD domains
is the  existence  of  subgroups  that have no conservation in motifs that are
conserved in  all  other members of the family or with a charge difference. It
has been  hypothesized that these differences account for functional diversity
within the  NERD  family.  The NERD domain is predicted to have an alpha-beta-
beta-beta-(weak beta/long loop)-alpha-beta-beta secondary structure [1].

Some proteins known to contain a NERD domain are listed below:

 - Bacillus anthracis pXO1-01 protein. It  is encoded by the virulence-related
   pXO1 plasmid.
 - Bacteroides spp. orf8 protein.

The profile we developed covers the entire NERD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2004 / First entry.
