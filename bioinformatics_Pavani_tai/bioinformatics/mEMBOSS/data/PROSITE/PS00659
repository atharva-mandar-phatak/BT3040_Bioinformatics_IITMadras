* Glycosyl hydrolases family 5 signature *
******************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family A [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 5  [4,E1].    The  enzymes  which are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Endoglucanases from various species and strains of Bacillus.
 - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endoglucanases 1 (end1) and A (celA).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum bifunctional endoglucanase/exoglucanase (celB).
   This protein consists of two  domains; it  is  the C-terminal domain, which
   has endoglucanase activity, which belongs to this family.
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase (eglA).
 - Clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanases A (celccA) and D (celccD).
 - Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanase B (engB) and D (engD).
 - Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases B (celB),   C (celC),  E (celE),  G
   (celG) and H (celH).
 - Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase Z (celZ).
 - Fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase 3 (cel-3).
 - Pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase C (celC).
 - Pseudomonas solanacearum endoglucanase (egl).
 - Robillarda strain Y-20 endoglucanase I.
 - Ruminococcus albus endoglucanases I (EG-I), A (celA), and B (celB).
 - Ruminococcus flavefaciens cellodextrinase A (celA).
 - Ruminococcus flavefaciens endoglucanase E (celE).
 - Streptomyces lividans endoglucanase.
 - Thermomonospora fusca endoglucanase E-5 (celE).
 - Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II (EGLII).
 - Xanthomonas campestris endoglucanase (engxcA).

As well as:

 - Baker's yeast glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase I/II (EC 3.2.1.58) (EXG1).
 - Baker's yeast glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase 2 (EC 3.2.1.58) (EXG2).
 - Baker's yeast sporulation-specific glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (SPR1).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum beta-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) (manA).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR056w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIR007w.

One of the  conserved regions in  these enzymes  contains a conserved glutamic
acid  residue  which is  potentially  involved [5] in the catalytic mechanism.
We use this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[LIVMFYWGA](2)-[DNEQG]-[LIVMGST]-{SENR}-N-E-[PV]-
                    [RHDNSTLIVFY]
                    [E may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Robillarda  Y-20  endoglucanase I whose sequence is known to be incorrect
 and yeast YBR056w.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 28.
