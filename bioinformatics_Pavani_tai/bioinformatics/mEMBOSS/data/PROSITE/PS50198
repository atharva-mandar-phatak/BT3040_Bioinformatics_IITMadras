* PpiC-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase signature and profile *
***********************************************************************

Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans  isomerase  (EC  5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase) is an
enzyme that   accelerates   protein   folding   by  catalyzing  the  cis-trans
isomerization of  proline  imidic  peptide  bonds  in  oligopeptides [1]. Most
characterized PPiases  belong  to  two  families,  the  cyclophilin-type  (see
<PDOC00154>) and the the FKBP-type (see <PDOC00426>).  Recently a third family
has been  discovered  [2,3].  So  far,  the  only  biochemically characterized
member of  this family is the Escherichia coli protein parvulin (gene ppiC), a
small (92  residues) cytoplasmic  enzyme that prefers amino acid residues with
hydrophobic side  chains  like leucine and phenylalanine in the P1 position of
the peptides  substrates. PpiC is evolutionary related to a number of proteins
that are also probably PPiases:

 - Escherichia  coli  and  Haemophilus influenzae ppiD. PpiD is a PPIase which
   contains a  periplasmic ppiC-like domain anchored to the inner membrane and
   which seems to be involved in the folding of outer membrane proteins.
 - Escherichia  coli  surA.  SurA  is  a periplasmic protein that contains two
   ppiC-like domains.
 - Nitrogen-assimilating  bacteria  protein  nifM  which  is  involved  in the
   activation and stabilization of the iron-component (nifH) of nitrogenase.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  protein  prsA, a membrane-bound lipoprotein involved in
   protein export.
 - Lactococcus and lactobacillus protease maturation protein prtM, a membrane-
   bound lipoprotein   involved   in  the  maturation  of  a  secreted  serine
   proteinase.
 - Yeast protein ESS1/PTF1 (processing/termination factor 1).
 - Drosophila protein dodo (gene dod).
 - Mammalian protein PIN1,
 - Campylobacter jejuni cell binding factor 2 (CBF2), a secreted antigen.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yacD.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0175.
 - A hypothetical slime mold protein.

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region that contains a serine
which could  play  a role in the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. We also
developed a profile that spans the complete ppiC domain.

-Consensus pattern: F-[GSADEI]-x-[LVAQ]-A-x(3)-[ST]-x(3,4)-[STQ]-x(3,5)-[GER]-
                    G-x-[LIVM]-[GS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
