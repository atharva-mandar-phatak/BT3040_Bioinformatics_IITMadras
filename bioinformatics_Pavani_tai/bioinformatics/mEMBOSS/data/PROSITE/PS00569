* Myelin basic protein signature *
**********************************

Myelin basic protein (MBP) [1,2] is an important hydrophilic protein which may
function to maintain proper structure of myelin.  MBP  interacts  with  myelin
lipids both electrostatically and by hydrophobic interactions.

In mammals various forms of  MBP exist which  are  produced by the alternative
splicing of a single gene; these forms  differ  by the presence or the absence
of short (10 to 20 residues)  peptides  in  various  internal locations in the
sequence.  The  major form of MBP is generally a protein of about 18.5 Kd (170
residues).

MBP is the target of many post-translational modifications: it is N-terminally
acetylated,  methylated  on  an  arginine residue, phosphorylated  by  various
serine/threonine protein-kinases, and deamidated on some glutamine residues.

As a signature  pattern  for MBP we selected  the  best  conserved part of the
protein, a perfectly conserved heptapeptide.

-Consensus pattern: V-V-H-F-F-K-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 1991 / First entry.
