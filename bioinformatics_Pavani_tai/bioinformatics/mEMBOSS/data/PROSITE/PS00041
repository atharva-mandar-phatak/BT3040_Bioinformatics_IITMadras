* Bacterial regulatory proteins, araC family signature and profile *
********************************************************************

The many bacterial transcription regulation proteins which bind DNA  through a
'helix-turn-helix' motif can  be  classified into subfamilies  on the basis of
sequence similarities. One  of these subfamilies groups together the following
proteins [1,2,3]:

 - aarP,  a  transcriptional  activator  of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene in
   Providencia stuartii.
 - ada,  an  Escherichia  coli and Salmonella typhimurium bifunctional protein
   that repairs  alkylated  guanine  in DNA by transferring the alkyl group at
   the O(6)  position  to  a  cysteine  residue  in the enzyme. The methylated
   protein acts  a  positive  regulator  of its own synthesis and of the alkA,
   alkB and aidB genes.
 - adaA, a Bacillus subtilis  bifunctional   protein  that   acts  both  as  a
   transcriptional activator of the ada operon and as a methylphosphotriester-
   DNA alkyltransferase.
 - adiY, an Escherichia coli protein of unknown function.
 - aggR,  the  transcriptional  activator  of  aggregative adherence fimbria I
   expression in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
 - appY, a protein  which  acts  as  a  transcriptional   activator  of   acid
   phosphatase and other proteins during  the deceleration phase of growth and
   acts as a repressor for other proteins that  are synthesized in exponential
   growth or in the stationary phase.
 - araC, the   arabinose operon   regulatory  protein,   which  activates  the
   transcription of the araBAD genes.
 - cafR, the Yersinia pestis F1 operon positive regulatory protein.
 - celD, the Escherichia coli cel operon repressor.
 - cfaD, a protein which is required for  the  expression of the CFA/I adhesin
   of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
 - csvR,  a  transcriptional  activator  of  fimbrial genes in enterotoxigenic
   Escherichia coli.
 - envY, the porin thermoregulatory  protein, which is involved in the control
   of  the  temperature-dependent  expression  of  several   Escherichia  coli
   envelope proteins such as ompF, ompC, and lamB.
 - exsA, an activator of exoenzyme S synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - fapR, the positive activator for the expression of  the  987P operon coding
   for the fimbrial protein in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
 - hrpB, a   positive  regulator   of  pathogenicity   genes  in  Burkholderia
   solanacearum.
 - invF, the Salmonella typhimurium invasion operon regulator.
 - marA,  which  may  be  a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the
   multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) phenotype.
 - melR, the  melibiose  operon  regulatory   protein,   which  activates  the
   transcription of the melAB genes.
 - mixE, a Shigella flexneri protein necessary for secretion of ipa invasins.
 - mmsR, the transcriptional  activator  for  the mmsAB operon  in Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa.
 - msmR, the multiple  sugar  metabolism  operon  transcriptional activator in
   Streptococcus mutans.
 - pchR, a Pseudomonas aeruginosa  activator for  pyochelin and ferripyochelin
   receptor.
 - perA,  a  transcriptional  activator  of  the  eaeA  gene  for  intimin  in
   enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.
 - pocR, a  Salmonella  typhimurium  regulator  of the  cobalamin biosynthesis
   operon.
 - pqrA, from Proteus vulgaris.
 - rafR, the regulator of the raffinose operon in Pediococcus pentosaceus.
 - ramA, from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
 - rhaR,  the  Escherichia  coli and  Salmonella typhimurium L-rhamnose operon
   transcriptional activator.
 - rhaS, an Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium positive activator of
   genes required for rhamnose utilization.
 - rns, a protein which is required for  the  expression  of  the  cs1 and cs2
   adhesins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
 - rob,  a protein which binds to the right arm of the replication origin oriC
   of the Escherichia coli chromosome.
 - soxS, a protein that, with the soxR protein, controls a superoxide response
   regulon in Escherichia coli.
 - tetD, a protein from transposon TN10.
 - tcpN or toxT, the Vibrio cholerae  transcriptional  activator  of  the  tcp
   operon involved in pilus biosynthesis and transport.
 - thcR,  a  probable  regulator  of the thc operon for the degradation of the
   thiocarbamate herbicide EPTC in Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21.
 - ureR, the transcriptional activator of the plasmid-encoded urease operon in
   Enterobacteriaceae.
 - virF and lcrF, the Yersinia virulence regulon transcriptional activator.
 - virF, the  Shigella  transcriptional  factor  of  invasion related antigens
   ipaBCD.
 - xylR, the Escherichia coli xylose operon regulator.
 - xylS,  the  transcriptional activator of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid
   (pWWO, pWW53 and pDK1) meta operon (xylDLEGF genes).
 - yfeG, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yhiW, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yhiX, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yidL, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yijO, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yuxC, a Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein.
 - yzbC, a Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein.

Except for celD, all of these  proteins seem  to  be  positive transcriptional
factors. Their size range from 107 (soxS) to 529 (yzbC) residues.

The helix-turn-helix  motif  is  located  in  the third quarter of most of the
sequences; the  N-terminal and  central regions of these proteins are presumed
to interact  with  effector molecules and may be involved in dimerization. The
minimal DNA binding domain, which spans roughly 100 residues and comprises the
HTH motif  contains  another  region  with similarity to classical HTH domain.
However, it contains an insertion of one residue in the turn-region.

A signature  pattern  was  derived  from the region that follows the first HTH
domain and  that  includes  the totality of the putative second HTH domain.  A
more sensitive  detection  of  members of the araC family is available through
the use  of  a  profile  which  spans  the  minimal  DNA-binding region of 100
residues.
