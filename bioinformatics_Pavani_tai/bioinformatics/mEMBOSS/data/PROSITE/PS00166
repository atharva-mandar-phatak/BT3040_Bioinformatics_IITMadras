* Enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase signature *
*******************************************

Enoyl-CoA hydratase  (EC 4.2.1.17)   (ECH)  [1]  and D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase
(EC 5.3.3.8) (ECI) [2] are two enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism.  ECH
catalyzes the hydratation of 2-trans-enoyl-CoA into 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA  and ECI
shifts the 3- double  bond  of  the  intermediates  of  unsaturated fatty acid
oxidation to the 2-trans position.

Most eukaryotic cells have two fatty-acid  beta-oxidation systems, one located
in mitochondria and the other in peroxisomes. In mitochondria, ECH and ECI are
separate yet structurally related monofunctional enzymes.  Peroxisomes contain
a trifunctional  enzyme [3] consisting of an N-terminal domain that bears both
ECH and  ECI  activity, and a C-terminal domain responsible for 3-hydroxyacyl-
CoA dehydrogenase (HCDH) activity.

In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA), ECH and ECI
are also  part  of  a multifunctional  enzyme which contains both a HCDH and a
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [4].

A number  of other proteins  have been found to be evolutionary related to the
ECH/ECI enzymes or domains:

 - 3-hydroxbutyryl-coa  dehydratase  (EC  4.2.1.55)  (crotonase),  a bacterial
   enzyme involved in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway.
 - Naphthoate  synthase  (EC  4.1.3.36)  (DHNA  synthase)  (gene  menB) [5], a
   bacterial enzyme  involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone (vitamin K2).
   DHNA synthase converts O-succinyl-benzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA) to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-
   naphthoic acid (DHNA).
 - 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.6) [6], a  Pseudomonas enzyme which
   catalyzes the conversion of 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA to 4-hydroxybenzoate-CoA.
 - A Rhodobacter capsulatus protein of unknown function (ORF257) [7].
 - Bacillus subtilis putative polyketide biosynthesis proteins pksH and pksI.
 - Escherichia coli carnitine racemase (gene caiD) [8].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygfG.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR036c.

As a signature pattern for these enzymes, we selected  a conserved region rich
in glycine and hydrophobic residues.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[STAG]-x-[LIVM]-[DENQRHSTA]-G-x(3)-[AG](3)-x(4)-
                    [LIVMST]-x-[CSTA]-[DQHP]-[LIVMFYA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.
