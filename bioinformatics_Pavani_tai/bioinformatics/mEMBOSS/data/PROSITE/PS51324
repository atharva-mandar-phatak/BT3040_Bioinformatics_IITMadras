* ERV/ALR sulfhydryl oxidase domain profile *
*********************************************

The ~100-residue  ERV/ALR  sulfhydryl  oxidase  domain  is  a versatile module
adapted for  catalysis  of  disulfide bond formation in various organelles and
biological settings.  The  ERV/ALR sulfhydryl oxidase domain has a Cys-X-X-Cys
dithiol/disulfide motif adjacent to a bound FAD cofactor, enabling transfer of
electrons  from thiol  substrates  to  non-thiol  electron  acceptors. ERV/ALR
family members  differ  in  their N- or C-terminal extensions, which typically
contain at  least  one  additional  disulfide bond, the hypothesized 'shuttle'
disulfide. In  yeast ERV1, a mitochondrial enzyme, the shuttle disulfide is N-
terminal to  the  catalytic  core;  in  yeast ERV2, present in the endoplasmic
reticulum, it  is  C-terminal.  The N- and C-terminal extensions can be entire
domains, such  as  the  thioredoxin-like  domains  (see  <PDOC00172>) or short
segments that  do  not  seem  to  be distinct domains. Proteins of the ERV/ALR
family are  encoded by all eukaryotes and cytoplasmic DNA viruses (poxviruses,
African swine  fever  virus,  iridoviruses,  and Paramecium bursaria Chlorella
virus 1) [1-5].

The ERV/ALR  sulfhydryl  oxidase  domain contains a four-helix bundle (helices
alpha1-alpha4) and   an  additional  single  turn  of  helix  (alpha5)  packed
perpendicular to  the  bundle (see <PDB:1JRA>) [3,4]. The FAD prosthetic group
is housed at the mouth of the 4-helix bundle and communicates with the pair of
juxtaposed cysteine residues that form the proximal redox active site [5].

Some proteins known to contain an ERV/ALR sulfhydryl oxidase domain are listed
below:

 - Yeast  essential  for  respiration and viability proteins 1 and 2 (ERV1 and
   ERV2). ERV1 is required for mitochondrial biogenesis.
 - Mammalian Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR), the homolog of ERV1.
 - Animal and plant quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX).
 - Poxviruses  E10R  protein,  that  promotes disulfide-bond formation in coat
   proteins assembling in the reducing environment of the cell cytosol.

The profile we developed covers the entire ERV/ALR sulfhydryl oxidase domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
