* ubiE/COQ5 methyltransferase family signatures *
*************************************************

The following  methyltransferases  have  been  shown  [1]  to share regions of
similarities:

 - Escherichia coli ubiE, which is involved in both ubiquinone and menaquinone
   biosynthesis and   which   catalyzes   the  S-adenosylmethionine  dependent
   methylation of  2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol into 2-polyprenyl-3-
   methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol and of demethylmenaquinol into menaquinol.
 - Yeast COQ5, a ubiquinone biosynthesis methlytransferase.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  spore  germination protein C2 (gene: gercB or gerC2), a
   probable menaquinone biosynthesis methlytransferase.
 - Lactococcus lactis gerC2 homolog.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK652.9.
 - Leishmania donovani amastigote-specific protein A41.

These are hydrophilic proteins of about 30 Kd (except for ZK652.9 which  is 65
Kd). They can be picked up in the database by the following patterns.

-Consensus pattern: Y-[DN]-x-[MLAFTI]-N-x(2)-[LIVMN]-S-x(3)-[HQD]-x(2)-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: R-V-[LIVMCT]-[KRQ]-[PVRK]-[GMKD]-[GAS]-x-[LIVMFAT]-x(2)-
                    [LIVMCA]-[ED]-x-[SGT]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Patterns and text revised.
