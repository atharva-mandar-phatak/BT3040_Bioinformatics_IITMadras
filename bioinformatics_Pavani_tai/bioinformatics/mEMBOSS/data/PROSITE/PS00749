* F-actin capping protein alpha subunit signatures *
****************************************************

The F-actin capping protein binds in  a calcium-independent manner to the fast
growing ends of  actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of
subunits at these ends.   Unlike  gelsolin  and  severin this protein does not
sever actin filaments.  The  F-actin capping protein is a heterodimer composed
of two unrelated subunits: alpha and beta.

The alpha subunit is a protein of about 268 to 308  amino  acid residues whose
sequence is well conserved in eukaryotic species [1].   As  signature patterns
we  selected  two highly  conserved regions in the C-terminal section  of  the
alpha subunit.
