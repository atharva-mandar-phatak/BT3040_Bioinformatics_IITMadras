* DM DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
***********************************************

The DM (Doublesex/Mab-3)  domain  is  found  in proteins from worm to mammals.
Null mutation  in  DM  domain  containing  proteins  doublesex  and  mab-3 are
associated with   intersexual  phenotypes.  These  proteins  are  believed  to
function as  transcription  factors  on  downstream  sex-determination  genes,
especially on  neuroblast differenciation and yolk protein genes transcription
[1,2].

The DM    domain   binds   DNA   as  a  dimer,  allowing  the  recognition  of
pseudopalindromic sequences  [3,4,5].  The  NMR  analysis of the DSX DM domain
[5] revealed  a novel zinc module containing 'intertwined' CCHC and HCCC zinc-
binding sites.  The recognition of the DNA requires the carboxy-terminal basic
tail which contacts the minor groove of the target sequence.

The way the 'intertwined' motif is binding two atoms of zinc is illustrated in
the following schematic representation:

                                            x x basic tail x x x Cter
                               x  x       x
                            x       H    C
                         x        x  \ /  x

'C': conserved cysteine involved in zinc binding.
'H': conserved histidine involved in zinc binding.
'Zn': zinc atom.

Some of the proteins containing a DM domain are listed below.

 - Mammalian DRMT1 and DRMT2 proteins. They are candidates for SRY independent
   male to female sex reversal.
 - Vertebrate  TERRA  proteins.  Play specific roles in early somitogenesis of
   vertebrates.
 - Drosophila doublesex  (DSX) male and female specific isoforms. Each isoform
   is supposed   to  repress  expression  of  terminal  differentiation  genes
   specific to  the  opposite  sex. The male isoform binds the fbe enhancer of
   the yolk gene and prevent its expression [5].
 - Caenorhabditis elegans  Male-ABnormal-3 (Mab-3) protein. Expressed in males
   and repressed in  hermaphrodites.  Mutations  affect the differentiation of
   certain tissues (intestine  and  lateral  epidermis)  in  males  but not in
   hermaphrodites.

As a  signature  pattern  for the DM domain, we selected the six cysteines and
the two histidines of the zinc module. We also developed a profile that covers
the whole DM domain.
