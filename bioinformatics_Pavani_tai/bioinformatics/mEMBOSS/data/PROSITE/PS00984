* Urotensin II signature *
**************************

Urotensin II  [1,2]  is  a  small  peptide originally isolated from the caudal
portion of the spinal cord of teleost and elasmobranch fish but which has also
been found in the brain of frogs.  Urotensin II seems to be involved in smooth
muscle stimulation.  It  is  a  peptide  of  12 to 13 residues that contains a
disulfide bridge.
