* Citron homology (CNH) domain profile *
****************************************

Based on  sequence  similarities a domain of homology has been identified near
the N- or C-terminal end of the following proteins [1,2,3]:

 - Citron Rho-interacting kinase (CRIK). It interacts with the GTP-bound forms
   of the small GTPases Rho and Rac, but not with Cdc42.
 - Myotonic  dystrophy  kinase-related  Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCKalpha). This
   serine/threonine kinase  interacts  with  the  GTP-bound  form of the small
   GTPase Cdc42 and to a lesser extent with that of Rac.
 - NCK Interacting Kinase (NIK), a serine/threonine protein kinase.
 - Yeast  ROM-1 and ROM-2. These proteins are GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEPs)
   for the small GTP binding protein Rho1.
 - Eukaryotic  Vam6/Vps39  protein.  It  may  function  as a tethering/docking
   factor specifically involved in lysosome fusion.

Little is  known  about  the  function of the CNH domain, although it has been
proposed to  regulate  kinase activity and to mediate binding to the GTP-bound
forms of  Rac  and  Rho.  The  CNH  domain  is  required  for association with
lysosomes and  overexpression-induced lysosome clustering and fusion. It could
interact with a docking protein or with lipids on the lysosomal membrane [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire CNH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
