**********************************

Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (EC 3.1.21.1) [1] is  a  vertebrate enzyme which
catalyzes the   endonucleolytic    cleavage  of  double-stranded  DNA  to  5'-
phosphodinucleotide  and 5'-phosphooligonucleotide end-products. DNase I is an
enzyme involved  in  DNA  degradation; it is normally secreted outside  of the
cell but  seems to be able to gain access to the nucleus  where it is involved
in cell death by apoptosis [2].

As shown  in the following schematic representation, DNase I is a glycoprotein
of about 260 residues with two conserved disulfide bonds.

'*': position of the patterns.

DNase I has a pH-optimum  around  7.5  and requires  calcium and magnesium for
full activity. It causes single strand nicks in duplex DNA. A proton acceptor-
donor chain   composed   of  an  histidine  and  a  glutamic  acid  produce  a
nucleophilic hydroxyl  ion  from  water,  which  cleaves  the 3'-P-O bond [3].
DNase I  is  inhibited  by  actin  with  which  it  forms a stoechiometric 1:1
complex [4].

The sequence of DNase I is evolutionary related to that of:

 - Human muscle-specific DNase-like protein (gene DNASE1L1 or DNL1L) [5].
 - Human protein DHP1 (gene DNASE1L2) [6].
 - Human protein DHP2 (gene DNASE1L3) [6].

The first disulfide bond of DNase I is not conserved in the above proteins.
