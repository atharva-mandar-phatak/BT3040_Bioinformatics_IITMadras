***********************************
* VPS28 C-terminal domain profile *
***********************************

The endosomal  sorting  complex I required for transport (ESCRT-I) is composed
of the  three  subunits VPS23/TSG101, VPS28 and VPS37. ESCRT-I is recruited to
cellular membranes  during multivesicular endosome biogenesis and by enveloped
viruses such  as HIV-1 to mediate budding from the cell. The C-terminal domain
of VPS28  is  characterized  by  a  high-sequence  conservation throughout all
kingdoms of  life.  It  does not directly participate in ESCRT-I assembly (see
<PDOC51312>) but  serves  as  an  adaptor module linked to the ESCRT-I complex
that connects its function to other components of the VPS machinery, including
ESCRT-III VPS20 [1].

The VPS28  C-terminal  domain  folds  independently into a four-helical bundle
structure with   N-   and  C-terminal  ends  juxtaposed  to  each  other  (see
<PDB:2G3K>). Helices 1, 2 and 4 have the same length, while helix 3 is shorter
and packs with  an approximate angle of 45 degrees against the remaining three
helices. The connecting loop regions between helices 1 and 2 and helices 2 and
3 are  short  compared  with the longer well-ordered loop connecting helices 3
and 4.  Because  this  loop  contains  a  conserved  sequence motif, it may be
involved in protein-protein interactions [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire VPS28 C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
