* Chitin-binding type-2 domain profile *
****************************************

The  species distribution of the chitin-binding type-2 domain is complementary
to  the  chitin-binding  type-1 domain (see <PDOC00025>). The type-2 is mainly
found  in  animal  and baculovirus proteins while the type-1 is found in plant
and   fungi.   Type-2   is   characterized   by  having  a  6-cysteine  motif:
C-x(13,20)-C-x(5,6)-C-x(9,19)-C-x(10,14)-C-x(4,14)-C   and   several  aromatic
residues [1].

The  structure  of the  chitin-binding  domain of  tachycitin  has been solved
(see  <PDB:1DQC>)  [2].  It  revealed  that  tachycitin  shares  a  remarkable
structural  similarity  with  the  chitin-binding type-1 domain of hevein. The
overall   structure   forms   a   distorted   beta-sandwich   constructed   by
three-stranded  and  two-stranded beta-sheets connected through a bending loop
(Cys-40-Leu-44).  The  precise  chitin  binding  site  (Cys-40  to  Gly-60) is
perfectly  superposable  with the chitin binding site of hevein. Furthermore a
disulfide  bridge  connecting  Cys-40  and  Cys-53 is also present at the same
location in the hevein structure [2].

Some protein known to contain a chitin-binding type-2 domain are listed below:

 - Animal  class-II  chitinase. It degrades chitin and chitotriose. In mammals
   it  may  participate  in  the defense against nematodes and other pathogens
   [3].
 - Tachycitin, an antimicrobial protein of horseshoe crab hemocytes.
 - Peritrophin-A,  a  component  of peritrophic matrices (acellular linings in
   the  gut  of  most  insects  that  comprise  proteins  and  sugar polymers,
   including chitin).
 - Drosophila Tequila protein, a serine protease involved in immune response.
 - Drosophila   Hemolectin,  a  sugar  binding  protein  involved  in  defense
   response.

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
