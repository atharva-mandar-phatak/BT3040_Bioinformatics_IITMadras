* Granulins signature *
***********************

Granulins [1] are a family of cysteine-rich  peptides  of about 6 Kd which may
have multiple  biological  activity. A precursor protein (known as acrogranin)
potentially encodes seven different forms of granulin (grnA to grnG) which are
probably released by post-translational proteolytic processing.    A schematic
representation of the structure of a granulin is shown below:

                                         **************

'C': conserved cysteine probably involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

Granulins are evolutionary related to a PMP-D1, a  peptide  extracted from the
pars intercerebralis of migratory locusts [2].

-Consensus pattern: C-x-D-x(2)-H-C-C-P-x(4)-C
                    [The 4 C's may be involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
