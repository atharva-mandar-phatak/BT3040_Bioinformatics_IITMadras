* DCD domain profile *
**********************

The DCD  domain  is  found  in plant proteins involved in development and cell
death. The DCD domain is an ~130 amino acid long stretch that contains several
mostly invariable  motifs.  These  include  a  FGLP  and a LFL motif at the N-
terminus and a PAQV and a PLxE motif towards the C-terminus of the domain. The
DCD domain  is present in proteins with different architectures. Some of these
proteins contain additional recognizable motifs, like the KELCH repeats or the
ParB domain [1].

The predicted secondary structure of the DCD domain is mostly composed of beta
strands and confined by an alpha-helix at the N- and at the C-terminus [1].

some proteins known to contain a DCD domain are listed below:

 - Carrot B2 protein.
 - Pea Gda-1 protein.
 - Soybean N-rich protein (NRP).

The profile we developed covers the entire DCD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: June 2006 / First entry.
