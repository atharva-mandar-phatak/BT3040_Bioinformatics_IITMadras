* Tau and MAP proteins tubulin-binding repeat signature and profile *
*********************************************************************

Microtubules consist  of tubulins  as well  as a group of  additional proteins
collectively known as the Microtubule Associated  Proteins (MAP).   MAP's have
been   classified into  two  classes:  high   molecular  weight  MAP's and Tau
protein. These   proteins   promote   microtubule   assembly   and   stabilize
microtubules. The  C-terminal  region of  a  subset of these proteins contains
three or four tandem repeats  of a conserved domain of about thirty amino acid
residues which  is  implicated  in  tubulin-binding  and which seems to have a
stiffening effect  on  microtubules.  The  proteins currently known to contain
such repeats are:

 - Tau [1], from neurones.
 - MAP2 [2], a neuronal member of the high molecular weight MAP's.
 - MAP4 [3], a non-neuronal member of the high molecular weight MAP's. MAP4 is
   is also expressed in some neurons.

The pattern  we  developed  to  detect  this  repeated  region  spans the last
thirteen residues  of  the  repeated region. We also developed a profile which
covers the entire repeat.

-Consensus pattern: G-S-x(2)-N-x(2)-H-x-[PA]-[AG]-G(2)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The first repeat of MAP2 is not picked up by the pattern because it has
 Tyr instead of His in position 8, and Lys instead of Gly in position 11.
