* Tryptophan synthase alpha chain signature *
*********************************************

Tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) catalyzes the last step in  the biosynthesis
of  tryptophan:  the  conversion  of  indoleglycerol  phosphate and serine, to
tryptophan and   glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  [1,2].  It  has  two  functional
domains: one for  the aldol cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate to indole and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and  the other for the synthesis of tryptophan from
indole and  serine.  In  bacteria  and  plants  [3], each domain is found on a
separate subunit (alpha and beta chains),  while  in fungi the two domains are
fused together on a single multifunctional protein.

As a  signature  pattern  for  the alpha chain, we selected a conserved region
that contains three conserved acidic residues.  The first and the third acidic
residues  are  believed to   serve as  proton donors/acceptors in the enzyme's
catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-E-[LIVM]-[GQ]-x-[PALT]-[FYCHTWP]-[STPK]-[DEKY]-
                    [PA]-[LIVMYGK]-[SGALIMY]-[DE]-[GN]
                    [The first E and the second D/E are active site residues]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the Sulfolobus solfataricus enzyme which is highly divergent.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 2011 / Pattern revised.
