* Thiol-activated cytolysins signature *
****************************************

Thiol-activated cytolysins  [1,2]  are  toxins  produced by a variety of Gram-
positive bacteria and are  characterized by their ability to lyse cholesterol-
containing membranes,  their reversible inactivation  by  oxidation  and their
capacity to  bind  to  cholesterol.  The  sequences of some of these toxins is
currently known:

 - Alveolysin (gene alv) from Bacillus alvei.
 - Ivanolysin (gene ilo) from Listeria ivanovii.
 - Listeriolysin O (gene hlyA) from Listeria monocytogenes.
 - Perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) (gene pfo) from Clostridium perfringens.
 - Pneumolysin (gene ply) from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 - Seeligeriolysin (gene lso) from Listeria seeligeri.
 - Streptolysin O (gene slo) from Streptococcus pyogenes.

All these  proteins contain  a  single  cysteine  residue, located in their C-
terminal section,  which  has  been  shown [3] to be essential for the binding
to cholesterol. This cysteine is located in a highly conserved region that can
be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [RK]-E-C-T-G-L-x-W-E-W-W-[RK]
                    [C is involved in the binding to cholesterol]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 1993 / Pattern and text revised.
