* JmjN and JmjC domains profiles *
**********************************

The JmjN  and  JmjC  domains  are  two  non-adjacent  domains  which have been
identified in  the  jumonji  family  of transcription factors. Although it was
originally suggested  that the JmjN and JmjC domains always co-occur and might
form a  single  functional unit within the folded protein, the JmjC domain was
latter found  without  the  JmjN  domain  in  organisms from bacteria to human
[1,2].

JmJC domains are predicted to be metalloenzymes that adopt the cupin fold (see
<PDB:1H2K>), and   are   candidates   for   enzymes  that  regulate  chromatin
remodelling. The  cupin  fold  is a flattened beta-barrel structure containing
two sheets  of  five  antiparallel beta strands that form the walls of a zinc-
binding cleft.  JmjC  domains  were identified in numerous eukaryotic proteins
containing domains   typical  of  transcription  factors,  such  as  PHD  (see
<PDOC50016>), C2H2  (see <PDOC00028>), ARID/BRIGHT and zinc fingers [2,3]. The
JmjC has  been  shown to function in a histone demethylation mechanism that is
conserved from yeast to human [4].

In addition  to eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family, a JmjC
domain is also found in the following proteins:

 - Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.
 - Mammalian  hairless.  In  human,  defects  in  HR are the cause of alopecia
   universalis congenita  (ALUNC)  [MIM:203655].  ALUNC  is  a  rare autosomal
   recessive form of hair loss characterized by hair follicles without hair.
 - Mammalian  F-box/LRR-repeat  protein  10  (FBXL10)  and 11 (FBXL11) or JmjC
   domain-containing histone demethylase 1B (JHDM1B) or 1A (JHDM1A).
 - Human retinoblastoma-binding protein 2.
 - Several putative chromatin-associated proteins.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxbC.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycfD.
 - Neisseria meningitidis Z2491 hypothetical protein NMA0679.

The profiles we developed cover the entire JmjN and JmjC domains.
