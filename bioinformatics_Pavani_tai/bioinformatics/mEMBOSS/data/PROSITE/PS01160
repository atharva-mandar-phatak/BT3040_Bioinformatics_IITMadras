* Kinesin light chain repeat *
******************************

Kinesin [1]  is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that may play
a role  in  organelle  transport. Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed of
two heavy  chains  and  two light chains. The light chain has been proposed to
function in  the  coupling of cargo to the heavy chain or in the modulation of
its ATPase activity [2]. It is a well conserved protein which is composed of a
core that  consist of a coiled-coil domain followed  by  four imperfect tandem
repeats of  a  42  residue  domain. The N- and C-termini are more variable and
alternative splicing is responsible for the production of isoforms that differ
in those two regions.

We developed a signature pattern that span the complete length of the repeated
segment.

-Consensus pattern: [DEQR]-A-L-x(3)-[GEQ]-x(3)-G-x-[DNS]-x-P-x-V-A-x(3)-N-x-L-
                    [AS]-x(5)-[QR]-x-[KR]-[FY]-x(2)-[AV]-x(4)-[HKNQ]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
