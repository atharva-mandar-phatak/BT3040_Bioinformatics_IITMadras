**********************
* GBP repeat profile *
**********************

Interactions between  Plasmodium falciparum merozoite and erythrocyte proteins
are essential  for  the  parasite's  survival.  One of the erythrocyte binding
proteins is  the  gylcophorin  binding  protein  (GBP-130),  which contains 11
highly conserved  50-residue-long  repeats. The GBP repeats have been shown to
bind to  the  erythrocyte  receptor  glycophorin. It appears that a minimum of
between 3.5  and  4.5  repeats  is  required  for  the  protein to bind to the
glycophorin matrix.  A  correlation  between  glycophorin  binding  and repeat
number might exist. GBPH is a Plasmodium protein highly homologous to GBP-130.
It carries  only  8 repeats of 40 residues, which can be superimposed on amino
acids 2-41 of the GBP repeats [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire GBP repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
