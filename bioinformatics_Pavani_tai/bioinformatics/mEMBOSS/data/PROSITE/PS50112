* PAS repeat and PAC domain profiles *
**************************************

The  PAS  region [1,2] is an approximately 300 amino-acid conserved region who
was  first  isolated  in  the  Drosophila  protein  period clock (PER), the Ah
receptor  nuclear translocator (ARNT) and the Drosophila  single-minded (SIM).
It  is composed of two or more imperfect repeats. Within the bHLH/PAS proteins
the PAS region is involved in protein dimerization with another protein of the
same  family.  It  has  also  been  associated  with  light  reception,  light
regulation  and  circadian  rhythm  regulators  (clock).  In bacteria, the PAS
repeat is usually associated with the input domain of a histidine kinase, or a
sensor protein that regulates a histidine kinase.

The PAS repeat is often associated with a PAC motif (PAS-associated C-terminal
motif),  a  conserved region of 40-45 amino acids situated carboxy-terminal to
any PAS repeat and which can contribute to the PAS structural domain.

The  PAS  family  can be divided into two groups. The first group contains the
PAS domain followed by a PAC motif:

 - Proteins of the bHLH/PAS superfamily which  are transcriptional activators.
   In mammals, the  Per  orthologs (Per1/rigui and  Per2), AH receptor nuclear
   translocator (ARNT) [3], single-minded orthologs (SIM1 and SIM2),  Hypoxia-
   inducible  factor  1  alpha (HIF1A), AH receptor (AHR), Neuronal Pas domain
   proteins  (NPAS1 and NPAS2) [5], Endothelial Pas domain  protein 1  (EPAS1)
   [6], mouse  ARNT2, and human BMAL1.  In Drosophila, single-minded (SIM), AH
   receptor   nuclear  translocator  (dARNT)  [4], similar  protein (SIMA) and
   trachealess protein (TRH).
 - Neurospora crassa light regulation proteins Wc1 and Wc2.
 - Azotobacter nitrogen fixation regulatory element nifL.
 - Bacillus subtilis sporulation kinase C (kinC).

The second group contains a PAS domain alone:

 - Clock proteins such as Drosophila period clock proteins (PER) and mammalian
   clock proteins.
 - Plant  phytochromes  A  and B. Regulatory photoreceptors which exist in two
   forms that  are  reversibly  interconvertible  by  light:  the pr form that
   absorbs maximally  in  the red region of the spectrum and the pFR   form that
   absorbs maximally  in  the  far-red  region.  photoconversion  of pr in pfr
   induces an array of morphogenic responses.

We developed two profiles,  one  that  spans  a single PAS repeat and one that
covers the whole PAC domain.
