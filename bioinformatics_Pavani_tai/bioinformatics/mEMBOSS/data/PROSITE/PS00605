* ATP synthase c subunit signature *
************************************

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.3.14) [1,2]  is a component
of the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,
and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of
an oligomeric  transmembrane  sector, called CF(0),  which acts  as  a  proton
channel, and a catalytic core, termed coupling factor CF(1).

The CF(0) c subunit (also called protein 9, proteolipid, or subunit III) [3,4]
is a highly hydrophobic protein of about 8 Kd which has been implicated in the
proton-conducting activity of ATPase. Structurally subunit c  consist  of  two
long  terminal  hydrophobic  regions, which probably span the membrane,  and a
central  hydrophilic region.   N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)  can  bind
covalently to subunit c and thereby abolish the ATPase activity. DCCD binds to
a specific glutamate or aspartate residue  which  is  located in the middle of
the second hydrophobic region near the C-terminus of the protein.

We derived a signature pattern which includes the DCCD-binding residue.

-Consensus pattern: [GSTA]-R-[NQ]-P-x(5)-{A}-x-{F}-x(2)-[LIVMFYW](2)-x(3)-
                    [LIVMFYW]-x-[DE]
                    [D or E binds DCCD]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for sunflower mitochondrial encoded subunit C which has Trp instead of Arg in
 position 2 of the pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note: The proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar ATPase,  a 16 Kd protein, which
 also binds DCCD, is evolutionary  related to subunit c  and has arisen by the
 duplication of a subunit c type domain. This protein is however too divergent
 to be detected by this pattern.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
