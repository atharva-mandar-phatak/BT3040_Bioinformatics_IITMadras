* EAR repeat profile *
**********************

Most  of  the  hereditary  idiopathic  epilepsies  are  due to mutation in ion
channels  expressed  in brain [1]. Recently two non-ion channel genes LGI1 and
VGLR1 have emerged as important causes of specific epilepsy syndromes [1]. The
product of these two genes share a conserved repeated region of about 44 amino
acid residues, the EAR domain (for epilepsy-associated repeat) [2].

The  predicted  secondary  structure  (four  beta-strands)  and the numbers of
repeated   copies   (seven)   suggest  that  the  EAR  domain  belongs to  the
beta-propeller  fold.  A  common functional feature found in all characterized
domains  of  this  class  is  a participation in protein–protein interactions.
Since  the EAR repeat is found in the ectodomain of VLGR1, it is most probably
involved in ligand recognition by the receptor [2].

Proteins known to contain EAR repeats are listed below:

 - Mammalian  LGI1  to  LGI4.  LGI1  is  mutated in autosomal dominant partial
   epilepsy  with  auditory  features (ADPEAF). The F348C missense mutation is
   located in the third EAR repeat (7 copies) [3].
 - Mammalian  thrombo-spondin  N-terminal  domain  and  EAR  repeats  containg
   protein (TSPEAR) (7 copies).
 - Mammalian  very  large  G  protein-coupled  receptor 1 (VGLR1) or monogenic
   audiogenic  seizure-susceptible  (MASS1)  protein.  In  mouse, mutations in
   MASS1  gene  are  associated  with  generalized  epilepsy  and  seizures in
   response to loud noises (7 copies) [4].

The profile we developed covers the whole EAR repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
