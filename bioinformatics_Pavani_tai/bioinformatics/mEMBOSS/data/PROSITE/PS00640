* Eukaryotic thiol (cysteine) proteases active sites *
******************************************************

Eukaryotic thiol proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) [1]  are  a  family  of   proteolytic
enzymes which contain an active site cysteine.   Catalysis  proceeds through a
thioester intermediate and is facilitated by a nearby histidine side chain; an
asparagine completes the essential catalytic triad.  The  proteases  which are
currently  known  to belong  to  this  family are listed below (references are
only provided for recently determined sequences).

 - Vertebrate  lysosomal  cathepsins B   (EC 3.4.22.1),   H  (EC 3.4.22.16), L
   (EC 3.4.22.15), and S (EC 3.4.22.27) [2].
 - Vertebrate lysosomal  dipeptidyl  peptidase I (EC 3.4.14.1)  (also known as
   cathepsin C) [2].
 - Vertebrate   calpains   (EC   3.4.22.52)  (EC  3.4.22.53).  Calpains    are
   intracellular calcium-activated   thiol   protease   that  contain  both  a
   N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal calcium-binding domain.
 - Mammalian cathepsin K, which seems involved in osteoclastic bone resorption
   [3].
 - Human cathepsin O [4].
 - Bleomycin hydrolase.  An  enzyme that  catalyzes  the  inactivation  of the
   antitumor drug BLM (a glycopeptide).
 - Plant enzymes: barley aleurain (EC 3.4.22.16), EP-B1/B4; kidney bean EP-C1,
   rice bean SH-EP;  kiwi fruit actinidin (EC 3.4.22.14);  papaya latex papain
   (EC 3.4.22.2),   chymopapain (EC 3.4.22.6),   caricain (EC 3.4.22.30),  and
   proteinase IV (EC 3.4.22.25); pea turgor-responsive protein 15A;  pineapple
   stem bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32); rape COT44;  rice  oryzain  alpha, beta, and
   gamma; tomato low-temperature induced, Arabidopsis thaliana A494, RD19A and
   RD21A.
 - House-dust mites allergens DerP1 and EurM1.
 - Cathepsin B-like proteinases from the  worms  Caenorhabditis elegans (genes
   gcp-1, cpr-3,  cpr-4,  cpr-5 and cpr-6), Schistosoma mansoni (antigen SM31)
   and Japonica  (antigen  SJ31),  Haemonchus contortus (genes AC-1 and AC-2),
   and Ostertagia ostertagi (CP-1 and CP-3).
 - Slime mold cysteine proteinases CP1 and CP2.
 - Cruzipain from Trypanosoma cruzi and brucei.
 - Throphozoite cysteine proteinase (TCP) from various Plasmodium species.
 - Proteases from Leishmania mexicana, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva.
 - Baculoviruses cathepsin-like enzyme (v-cath).
 - Drosophila  small  optic  lobes protein (gene sol), a neuronal protein that
   contains a calpain-like domain.
 - Yeast thiol protease BLH1/YCP1/LAP3.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   hypothetical  protein  C06G4.2,  a  calpain-like
   protein.

Two bacterial peptidases are also part of this family:

 - Aminopeptidase C from Lactococcus lactis (gene pepC) [5].
 - Thiol protease tpr from Porphyromonas gingivalis.

Three other  proteins  are  structurally  related to this family, but may have
lost their proteolytic activity.

 - Soybean  oil  body   protein P34. This protein has its active site cysteine
   replaced by a glycine.
 - Rat  testin, a sertoli cell secretory protein highly similar to cathepsin L
   but with  the  active  site  cysteine  is  replaced by a serine. Rat testin
   should not be confused with mouse testin which is a LIM-domain protein (see
   <PDOC00382>).
 - Plasmodium falciparum serine-repeat protein (SERA),  the  major blood stage
   antigen. This protein of 111 Kd possesses  a C-terminal thiol-protease-like
   domain [6], but the active site cysteine is replaced by a serine.

The sequences around the three active site residues are well conserved and can
be used as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: Q-{V}-x-{DE}-[GE]-{F}-C-[YW]-{DN}-x-[STAGC]-[STAGCV]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for P34, testins, SERA antigen, and Theileria annulara protease.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 6.

-Note: The residue in position 4 of the pattern is almost always cysteine; the
 only exceptions are calpains (Leu), bleomycin hydrolase (Ser) and  yeast YCP1
 (Ser).
-Note: The residue in position 5 of the pattern is always Gly except in papaya
 protease IV where it is Glu.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMGSTAN]-{IEVK}-H-[GSACE]-[LIVM]-{GPSI}-[LIVMAT](2)-G-
                    {SLAG}-[GSADNH]
                    [H is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for calpains, P34 and tpr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 146.

-Consensus pattern: [FYCH]-[WI]-[LIVT]-x-[KRQAG]-N-[ST]-W-x(3)-[FYW]-G-x(2)-G-
                    [LFYW]-[LIVMFYG]-x-[LIVMF]
                    [N is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for calpains, bromelain, yeast BLH1, tomato low-temperature induced protease,
 cathepsin O, pepC and tpr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belong to family C1 (papain-type) and C2 (calpains) in
 the classification of peptidases [7,E1].
