* Zinc finger HIT-type profile *
********************************

The HIT-type zinc finger contains 7 conserved cysteines and one histidine that
can  potentially  coordinate two zinc atoms. It has been named after the first
protein  that  originally  defined the domain: the yeast HIT1 protein [1]. The
HIT-type zinc finger displays some sequence similarities to the MYND-type zinc
finger  (see  <PDOC50865>).  The  function of this domain is unknown but it is
mainly  found  in  nuclear  proteins involved in gene regulation and chromatin
remodeling.

Some proteins known to contain a HIT-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Mammalian  thyroid hormone receptors interacting protein 3 (Trip3). It also
   interacts  with  the  retinoid X receptor and activates the transcriptional
   factor HNF-4alpha [2].
 - Mammalian FON protein.
 - Yeast HIT1 protein. It is required for high temperature growth.
 - Yeast VPS71 protein. It is a component  of the chromatin remodeling complex
   Swr1,  which catalyzes the exchange of histone H2A to histone variant H2AZ.
   This step has an important influence on gene expression [3].

The profile we developed covers the whole HIT-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
