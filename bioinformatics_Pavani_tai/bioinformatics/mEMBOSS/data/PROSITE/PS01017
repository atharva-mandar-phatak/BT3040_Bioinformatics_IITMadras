* Sterol reductase family signatures *
**************************************

The following  enzymes belong to a conserved family of sterol reductases which
act by reducing double bonds [1,2]:

 - Fungal  delta(14)-sterol  reductase  (EC  1.3.1.70) (C-14 sterol reductase)
   (gene ERG24 in budding yeast), an enzyme of ergosterol biosynthesis.
 - Mammalian (TM7SF2) and plant delta(14)-sterol reductases.
 - Fungal  delta(24(24(1)))-sterol  reductase  (EC  1.3.1.71) (C-24(28) sterol
   reductase) (gene   ERG4   in   budding  yeast),  an  enzyme  of  ergosterol
   biosynthesis.
 - Mammalian  7-dehydrocholesterol  reductase  (EC  1.3.1.21)  which  produces
   cholesterol by  reduction  of C7-C8 double bond of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-
   DHC).
 - Lamin  B  receptor,  which  is  thought  to  anchor the lamina to the inner
   nuclear membrane.

All these  proteins  are highly hydrophobic and seem to contain seven or eight
transmembrane regions.  As  signature  patterns,  we  selected  two  conserved
regions. The  first one is apparently located in a loop between the fourth and
fifth transmembrane regions and the second is in the C-terminal section.
