**************************************************************

Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 3.5.99.6) (or Glc-6-P deaminase) is  the
enzyme responsible for the conversion of glucosamine 6-phosphate into fructose
6 phosphate [1].  It  is  the  last  specific  step  in  the  pathway  for  N-
acetylglucosamine (GlcNAC)  utilization  in  bacteria such as Escherichia coli
(gene nagB) or in fungi such as Candida albicans (gene NAG1).

Glc-6-P isomerase is evolutionary related to:

 - A putative Escherichia coli galactosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (gene agaI)
   [2].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yieK.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ybfT.

As a  signature  pattern we selected a conserved region located in the central
part  of these enzymes.  This region  contains a conserved histidine which has
been shown [1], in nagB, to be important for the pyranose ring-opening step of
the catalytic mechanism.
