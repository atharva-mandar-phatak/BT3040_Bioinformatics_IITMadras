* PWWP domain profile *
***********************

The  PWWP  domain  is an around 70 amino acids domain that was named after its
central  core  'Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro'.  The  PWWP  domain  is found in one or, less
frequently, in two copies in nuclear, often DNA-binding proteins that function
as  transcription  factors  regulating  developmental  processes.  Due  to its
position,  the  composition  of  amino  acids  close to the PWWP motif and the
pattern of other domains present, it has been proposed that the PWWP domain is
involved in protein-protein interactions [1].

Conservation  of  the  PWWP  domain is concentrated on one major and two minor
blocks with length differences occurring in between [1].

Some proteins known to contain a PWWP domain are listed below:

 - Human  WHSC1  protein,  encoded  by  a  gene  located in the Wolf-Hirschorn
   syndrome critical region.
 - Human  bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1/Peregrin) and
   3 (BRPF3). These are possible transcription activators.
 - Human bromodomain-containing protein 1 (BRD1).
 - Human  BS69 protein, highly expressed in colon carcinoma. It interacts with
   E1A specifically suppressing E1A-activated transcription.
 - Mammalian   hepatoma-derived   growth  factor  (HDGF),  an  heparin-binding
   protein, with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.
 - Mammalian DNA mismatch repair protein MSH6.
 - Vertebrate DNA-cytosine-methyltransferase type 3 (DNMT3).

The profile we developed covers the entire PWWP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
