* D-alanine--D-alanine ligase signatures *
******************************************

D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.4) is  a  bacterial  enzyme  involved in
cell-wall biosynthesis.   It   participates   in  forming  UDP-N-acetylmuramyl
pentapeptide, the peptidoglycan precursor.

In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, there are two different D-ala--D-ala
ligase  isozymes (genes  ddlA  and ddlB) [1].  In Enterobacterium faecium  and
gallinarum, genes  vanA  and  vanC  encode  D-ala--D-ala  ligases  of  altered
specificity, which  catalyze  ester  bond formations between D-ala and various
D-hydroxy acids   [2].  They  are  required  for  resistance  to  glycopeptide
antibiotics, such  as  vancomycin  which  inhibits  late  stages  in cell-wall
synthesis.

These enzymes  are  proteins of      300  to 360 amino acids.  There  are many
conserved regions, of  which  we selected two as signature patterns. The first
pattern, which  is  Gly-rich  and could be involved in ATP-binding, is located
near the N-terminal extremity, the second is in the C-terminal section.
