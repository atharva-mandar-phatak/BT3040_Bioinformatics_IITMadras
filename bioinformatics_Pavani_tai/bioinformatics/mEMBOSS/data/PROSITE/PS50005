***********************

The  tetratrico  peptide  repeat  (TPRs)  [1]  is  a  degenerate 34-amino acid
repeated  motif  that  is  widespread  among  all  organisms. In the cell, TPR
containing  proteins  are  localized  in a variety of subcellular compartment,
including the nucleus, the cytoplasm and mitochondria [2]. Processes involving
TPR  proteins  include  cell-cycle  control,  transcription repression, stress
response,  protein  kinase  inhibition,  mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein
transport  and  neurogenesis. TPR repeats mediate protein–protein interactions
and  the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The smallest functional unit that
is widely used appears to be three tandem-TPR motifs [3].

Many  3D  structures  of  TPR  domains  have  been  solved  (see  for  example
<PDB:1A17>)  [4].  A  single TPR contains two antiparallel alpha helices which
pack into an open structure [4] such that tandem arrays of TPR motifs generate
a  right-handed  helical  structure  with  an  amphipathic  channel that might
accommodate  the  complementary  region  of  a  target  protein. An additional
capping helix at the C-terminus is present in almost all TPR structures solved
to  date.  This  helix  could  be essential for the solubility or stability of
these  isolated  domains.  The  consensus  sequence  of  a TPR is defined by a
pattern  of  small  and  large  hydrophobic  amino acids. Turn-positions, both
between  the  two  helices  of a single TPR and between the two adjacent TPRs,
show conservation of helix-breaking residues [5].

Some of the proteins containing TPR repeats are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic   Cdc16,   Cdc23   and   Cdc27   proteins,   components  of  the
   anaphase-promoting complex (APC).
 - Fission  yeast  Nuc2  protein,  an  homologue of Cdc27. Nuc2 interacts with
   spindle  apparatus,  chromosomes,  or  nuclear  envelope,  and interconnect
   nuclear and cytoskeletal functions in mitosis.
 - Human  Bardet-Biedl  syndrome  4  protein. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a
   genetically  heterogeneous,  autosomal  recessive disorder characterized by
   usually  severe  pigmentary  retinopathy, early onset obesity, polydactyly,
   hypogenitalism, renal malformation and mental retardation.
 - Mammalian  DnaJ  homolog subfamily C member 7 protein (DnaJC7). TPR repeats
   of DnaJC7 interacts with the GAP domain of NF1.
 - Eukaryotic Pex5p/Pas10p, the receptor for peroxisomal targeting signals.
 - Eukaryotic  translocase  of outer membrane TOM70 protein, a co-receptor for
   mitochondrial targeting signals.
 - Mammalian Ser/Thr phosphatase 5C. It interacts with CDC16 and CDC27.
 - Animal  O-GlcNAc  transferase,  p110  subunit. It adds nucleotide-activated
   sugars  directly onto the polypeptide through O-glycosidic linkage with the
   hydroxyl of serine or threonine.
 - Bacterial cellulose synthase protein C.
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum Sol locus transcriptional repressor.
 - Bacillus subtilis response regulator aspartate phosphatase F.

Two profiles were developed for this module, the first one picks up TPR repeat
units while  the  second  profile is 'circular' and will thus detects a region
containing adjacent TPR repeats.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the circular profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 9.
