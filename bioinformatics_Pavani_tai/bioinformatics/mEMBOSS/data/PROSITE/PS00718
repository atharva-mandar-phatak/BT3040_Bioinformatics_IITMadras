* Sigma-54 factors family signatures and profile *
**************************************************

Sigma factors [1] are bacterial transcription initiation factors  that promote
the attachment of the core RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are
then released.  They  alter  the  specificity  of  promoter  recognition. Most
bacteria express a multiplicity of sigma factors. Two of these factors, sigma-
70 (gene  rpoD),  generally  known  as the major or primary sigma factor,  and
sigma-54 (gene  rpoN  or  ntrA)  direct the transcription of a wide variety of
genes. The    other  sigma  factors,  known  as alternative sigma factors, are
required for the transcription of specific subsets of genes.

With regard  to  sequence  similarity,  sigma  factors can be grouped into two
classes: the  sigma-54  and  sigma-70  families.  The sigma-70 family has many
different sigma  factors  (see the relevant entry <PDOC00592>).   The sigma-54
family consists   exclusively  of  sigma-54  factor  [2,3]  required  for  the
transcription of  promoters  that  have a characteristic -24 and -12 consensus
recognition element  but  which  are  devoid  of the typical -10,-35 sequences
recognized by   the  major    sigma  factors.  The  sigma-54  factor  is  also
characterized by  its  interaction  with    ATP-dependent  positive regulatory
proteins that bind to upstream activating sequences.

Structurally sigma-54 factors consist of three distinct regions:

 - A relatively well  conserved N-terminal glutamine-rich region  of about  50
   residues that contains a potential leucine zipper motif.
 - A region of variable length which is not well conserved.
 - A well conserved C-terminal region  of about  350  residues that contains a
   second potential leucine zipper, a potential DNA-binding 'helix-turn-helix'
   motif and a perfectly conserved octapeptide whose function is not known.

We  developed  two signature patterns  for  this family  of sigma factors. The
first starts  two  residues before the N-terminal extremity of the helix-turn-
helix region and ends two residues before its C-terminal extremity. The second
is the conserved octapeptide. A profile has also been designed that covers the
whole C-terminal region.
