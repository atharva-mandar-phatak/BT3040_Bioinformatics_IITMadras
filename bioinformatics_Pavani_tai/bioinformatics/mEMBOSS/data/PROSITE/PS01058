* SAICAR synthetase signatures *
********************************

Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase  (EC 6.3.2.6) (SAICAR
synthetase) catalyzes  the  seventh  step  in  the de novo purine biosynthetic
pathway; the ATP-dependent conversion of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-
carboxylic acid  and  aspartic  acid  to  SAICAR [1]. In bacteria (gene purC),
fungi (gene  ADE1)  and plants, SAICAR synthetase is a monofunctional protein;
in higher  vertebrates  it  is the N-terminal domain  of a bifunctional enzyme
that also catalyze phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (AIRC) activity.

As signature patterns for SAICAR synthetase, we selected two conserved regions
in the central section of this enzyme.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMRPA]-[LIVFY]-[PLNRKG]-[LIVMF]-E-x-[IV]-[LVCATI]-R-
                    x(3)-[TAEYSI]-G-[ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LI]-[IVCAP]-D-x-K-[LIFY]-E-[FI]-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
