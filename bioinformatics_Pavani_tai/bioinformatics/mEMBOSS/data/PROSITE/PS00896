* LacY family proton/sugar symporters signatures *
**************************************************

In bacteria there are a number of families  of transport proteins that mediate
the intake  of a variety of  sugars  with the  concomitant  uptake of hydrogen
ions (proton  symporters) [1].  One of these families  is  composed [2] of the
following proteins:

 - Escherichia  coli  and  Klebsiella  pneumoniae lactose permease (gene lacY)
   which are responsible for the transport of beta-galactosides into the cell.
 - Escherichia coli plasmid pRsd2 raffinose permease (gene rafB).
 - Escherichia coli sucrose permease (gene cscB).

These integral membrane proteins  are  predicted  to  comprise twelve membrane
spanning domains.  As  signature  patterns  we selected  two conserved regions
that both    correspond  to cytoplasmic loops:  between  the  second and third
transmembrane regions  for  the  first pattern and between the eight and ninth
for the second pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-[LIVM](2)-x-D-[RK]-L-G-L-[RK](2)-x-[LIVM](2)-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: P-x-[LIVMF](2)-N-R-[LIVM]-G-x-K-N-[STA]-[LIVM](3)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
