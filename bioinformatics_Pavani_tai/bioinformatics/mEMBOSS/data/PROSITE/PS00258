* Calcitonin / CGRP / IAPP family signature *
*********************************************

Calcitonin [1] is a 32 amino acid polypeptide hormone  that causes a rapid but
short-lived drop  in the  level  of  calcium  and  phosphate in the  blood, by
promoting the  incorporation of  these ions in the bones. Alternative splicing
of the gene coding for calcitonin  produces a  distantly related peptide of 37
amino acids,  called  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide  (CGRP).  CGRP induces
vasodilatation  in  a  variety  of vessels,  including  the coronary, cerebral
and systemic  vasculature.  Its  abundance  in  the  CNS  also points toward a
neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role.

Islet amyloid  polypeptide  (IAPP)  [2]  (also  known  as  diabetes-associated
peptide (DAP),  or  amylin)  is  a  peptide of 37 amino acids that selectively
inhibits insulin-stimulated  glucose  utilization and  glycogen  deposition in
muscle, while  not  affecting adipocyte glucose metabolism. Structurally, IAPP
is closely related to CGRP.

Two conserved  cysteines  in the  N-terminal of these peptides are known to be
involved in a disulfide bond.  The C-terminal residue of all three peptides is
amidated.

'*': position of the pattern.

The pattern we  developed  for this family of  peptides includes the region of
the disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: C-[SAGDN]-[STN]-x(0,1)-[SA]-T-C-[VMA]-x(3)-[LYF]-x(3)-
                    [LYF]
                    [The 2 C's are linked by a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
