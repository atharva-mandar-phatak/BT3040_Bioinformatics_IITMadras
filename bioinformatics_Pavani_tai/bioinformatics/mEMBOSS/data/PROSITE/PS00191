* Cytochrome b5 family, heme-binding domain signature and profile *
*******************************************************************

Cytochrome b5  is  a  membrane-bound  hemoprotein  which  acts as an  electron
carrier for several membrane-bound  oxygenases [1].   There are two homologous
forms of b5, one  found in microsomes and one  found in the outer  membrane of
mitochondria.  Two conserved histidine residues serve as axial ligands for the
heme group.    The  structure of  a number  of oxidoreductases consists of the
juxtaposition of  a  heme-binding domain homologous to that of b5 and either a
flavodehydrogenase or a molybdopterin domain. These enzymes are:

 - Lactate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.1.2.3) [2], an   enzyme  that  consists  of  a
   flavodehydrogenase domain and a heme-binding domain called cytochrome b2.
 - Nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.1.-), a key enzyme involved in  the first step of
   nitrate  assimilation in  plants, fungi  and  bacteria [3,4]. Consists of a
   molybdopterin domain   (see  <PDOC00484>),  a  heme-binding  domain  called
   cytochrome b557, as well as a cytochrome reductase domain.
 - Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) [5],  which catalyzes the terminal reaction in
   the oxidative degradation  of sulfur-containing  amino acids. Also consists
   of a molybdopterin domain and a heme-binding domain.
 - Yeast  acyl-CoA  desaturase  1  (EC  1.14.19.1)  (gene  OLE1).  This enzyme
   contains a C-termainal heme-binding domain.

This family of proteins also includes:

 - TU-36B, a Drosophila muscle protein of unknown function [6].
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC1F12.10c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YMR073c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YMR272c.

We used a segment which includes the first  of the two histidine heme ligands,
as a signature pattern for the heme-binding domain of cytochrome b5 family.
