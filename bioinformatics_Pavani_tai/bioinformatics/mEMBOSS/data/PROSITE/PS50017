* Death domain profile *
************************

The death  domain  [1,2,3,E1] (FAS/TNF cytosolic interaction domain) has first
been described  as  a region in the cytoplasmic tail of the 75 Kd TNF receptor
(TNFR-1) (see  <PDOC00561>)  which  is  involved  in  TNF-mediated  cell death
signaling. A corresponding region is found in the cytoplasmic tail of FAS/APO1
another surface  receptor  inducing apoptotic cell death. This region mediates
self-association of  these  receptors,  thus  giving  the signal to downstream
events leading to apoptosis.

Subsequently, a number of other proteins have  been found to interact with the
cytoplasmic part of either FAS or the TNF receptor  in the region of the death
domain. Overexpression  of  these  proteins  usually  leads  to cell death. By
profile analysis, it has been shown that  a number  of  other proteins contain
regions with  significant  similarity  to  the  death  domain.  Interestingly,
several of these proteins also work in the context of cell death signaling.

The following proteins have been found to contain a death domain:

 - Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  type  I  (TNFR-1),  which  induces cell death upon
   binding of TNF.
 - FAS/APO1 receptor, which induces cell death upon binding of FAS-ligand.
 - Low-affinity  nerve  growth factor receptor (LA-NGFR), which is involved in
   inducing cell death, sensing the absence of it's ligand NGF.
 - Wsl-1, a receptor that mediates apoptosis.
 - MORT1/FADD, a human protein that binds to the death  domain of FAS/APO1 and
   induces apoptosis.
 - TRADD, a human protein that binds to TNFR-1, signaling cell death and NF-kB
   activation.
 - RIP,  a  human  protein that interacts with FAS/APO1 and weakly with TNFR-1
   and induces  cell  death.  Rip  contains  a protein kinase domain at its N-
   terminus.
 - All  known isoforms of ankyrin, this includes the ankyrin-like protein unc-
   44 from  Caenorhabditis  elegans.    Ankyrin is a protein that attaches the
   cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.
 - Human 'death associated protein kinase' (DAP-kinase), a  mediator of gamma-
   interferon induced cell death.
 - p84, a human protein that binds to the N-terminus of the Rb-protein.
 - MyD88,  a  mouse  macrophage  differentiation  marker  that also contains a
   TOLL/IL1R-domain.
 - Unc-5, a Caenorhabditis elegans receptor-type neuronal guidance protein.
 - Pelle,  a  protein  kinase  from  Drosophila  involved  in  the Toll/Dorsal
   signaling pathway.

 - Reaper,  a  cell  death  mediating  protein  from Drosophila, has also been
   reported [4] to contain a death domain. However, rigorous sequence analysis
   [2] does not statistically confirm the presence of such a domain.

In most  of  these  proteins,  the  death  domain is located at the extreme C-
terminus. Exceptions  are  ankyrin,  MyD88 and pelle, all protein probably not
directly involved in cell death signaling. In the case of ankyrin, the isoform
2.1 is a splice variant which has the death domain located at the C-terminus.

The profile  covers  the  complete  domain  up to the boundaries that define a
minimally functional  death  domain  in  FAS  and TNF-receptor. This region is
slightly bigger than the observed sequence conservation.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
