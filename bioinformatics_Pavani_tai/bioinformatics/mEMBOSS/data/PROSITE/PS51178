* PASTA domain profile *
************************

The PASTA  domain  (for penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase
associated domain) is an extracellular module of ~70 residues that is found in
the C-termini  of  eukaryotic-like  serine/threonine  kinases (PSTKs) and high
molecular weight  penicilin-binding  proteins  (PBPs).  The  PASTA  domain  is
distributed mainly  in  the GRAM-positive bacteria, most notably among species
of the  genera  Bacillus  and  Clostridia.  It is not found in eukaryotes. The
PASTA domain occurs both singly and in multiple copies, which suggests that it
is a  domain  rather than a structural repeat. It is found in association with
other domains,  such  as  transpeptidase,  protein kinase (see <PDOC00100>) or
transglycolase [1].

The PASTA domain is a small globular fold consisting of three beta strands and
an alpha  helix,  with  a loop region of variable length between the first and
second beta strands (see <PDB:1QMF>) [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire PASTA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
