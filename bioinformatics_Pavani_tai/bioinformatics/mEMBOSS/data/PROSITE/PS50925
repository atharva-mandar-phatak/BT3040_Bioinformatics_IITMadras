* BLUF domain profile *
***********************

The BLUF (for 'sensors of blue-light using FAD') domain is an about 90-residue
FAD-binding domain  involved  in  sensory  transduction in microorganisms. The
BLUF domain  is  mainly  found in two branches of Bacteria, Proteobacteria and
Cyanobacteria, but  also  in  the  eukaryotic  unicellular  flagellate Euglena
gracilis. BLUF  domain  proteins  can  be  divided into 'complex', multidomain
proteins and  'short' proteins composed of a BLUF domain plus 30-70 additional
amino acids with no significant similarity to known protein motifs. In complex
proteins the  BLUF  domain  can  be  linked  to the adenyl cyclase, GGDEF (see
<PDOC50887>) or  EAL (see <PDOC50883>) domains. The BLUF domain is supposed to
be involved  in  sensing  blue-light  (and  possibly  redox)  using FAD and is
similar to  the flavin-binding PAS domains (see <PDOC50112>) and cryptochromes
[1].

Some proteins known to contain a BLUF domain are listed below:

 - Rhodobacter sphaeroides protein appA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycgF.
 - Euglena gracilis alpha and beta subunit of photoactivated adenylate cyclase
   (PAC) (EC 4.6.1.1).

The profile we developed covers the entire BLUF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: September 2003 / First entry.
