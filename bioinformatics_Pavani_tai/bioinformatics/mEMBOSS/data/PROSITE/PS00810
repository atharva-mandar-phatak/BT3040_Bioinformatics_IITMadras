* ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase signatures *
********************************************

ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase) [1,2]
(EC 2.7.7.27)  catalyzes  a  very  important  step   in  the  biosynthesis  of
alpha 1,4-glucans  (glycogen  or  starch) in bacteria and plants: synthesis of
the activated glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose, from glucose-1-phosphate and ATP.

ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a tetrameric allosterically regulated enzyme.
It is a homotetramer in bacteria while in plant  chloroplasts and amyloplasts,
it is a heterotetramer of two different, yet evolutionary related, subunits.

There are a number of  conserved  regions in  the  sequence  of  bacterial and
plant ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase  subunits.  We  selected  three  of these
regions as  signature  patterns.  The  first  two are N-terminal and have been
proposed to  be  part  of the allosteric and/or substrate-binding sites in the
Escherichia coli  enzyme  (gene  glgC).  The  third  pattern  corresponds to a
conserved region in the central part of the enzymes.
