* Uncharacterized protein family UPF0076 signature *
****************************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Goat antigen UK114, a human homolog and the rat corresponding protein which
   is known as perchloric acid soluble protein (PSP1). PSP1 [2] may inhibit an
   initiation stage of cell-free protein synthesis.
 - Mouse heat-responsive protein HRSP12.
 - Yeast chromosome V hypothetical protein YER057c.
 - Yeast chromosome IX hypothetical protein YIL051c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C23G10.2.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycdK.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhaR.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yjgF and HI0719, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yoaB.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yabJ.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1627.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0944.
 - Lactococcus lactis aldR.
 - Myxococcus xanthus dfrA.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0709.
 - Rhizobium strain NGR234 symbiotic plasmid hypothetical protein y4sK.
 - Pyrococcus horikoshii hypothetical protein PH0854.

These are  small  proteins of around 15 Kd whose sequence is highly conserved.
As a signature  pattern, we selected a well conserved region located in the C-
terminal part of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [PA]-[ASTPV]-R-[SACVF]-x-[LIVMFY]-x(2)-[GSAKR]-x-[LMVA]-
                    x(5,8)-[LIVM]-E-[MI]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
