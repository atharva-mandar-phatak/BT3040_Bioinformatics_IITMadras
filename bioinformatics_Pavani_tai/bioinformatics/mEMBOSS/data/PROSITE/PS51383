* YjeF C-terminal domain signatures and profile *
*************************************************

The YjeF  C-terminal  domain  is an ~280-residue module found in the following
proteins:

 - Yeast chromosome XI hypothetical protein YKL151c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R107.2.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein YjeF.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxkO.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP1363.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY77.05c.
 - Mycobacterium leprae hypothetical protein B229_C2_201.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein sll1433.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ1586.
 - Streptococcus mutans	putative uncharacterized protein SMU.573.
 - Streptococcus thermophilus predicted sugar kinase STER_0661.
 - Streptococcus sanguinis putative uncharacterized protein SSA_0673.
 - Thermotoga maritima hypothetical protein Tm0922.

The YjeF  C-terminal  domain  has an alpha/beta fold and shows high structural
homology to  the  members of a ribokinase-like superfamily. The members of the
ribokinase-like superfamily  are  all  phosphotransferases  and  catalyze  the
phosphorylation of the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate; magnesium and ATP
(or ADP)  are  required  for  their  activity. The YjeF C-terminal is found in
association with  the  YjeF  N-terminal domain, which belongs of a specialized
family of Rossmann fold domains (see <PDOC51385>) [1-3].

The first  pattern  we  developed  covers  residues  that might be involved in
forming the  substrate-binding  pocket. The second one corresponds to residues
that could form a kinase anion hole, with the conserved aspartate predicted to
be the  catalytic  base  [1].  We  also  developed  a profile which covers the
entire YjeF C-terminal domain.
