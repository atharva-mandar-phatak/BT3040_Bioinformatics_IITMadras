* Macrophage migration inhibitory factor family signature *
***********************************************************

A protein  called  macrophage  migration  inhibitory factor (MIF) [1] seems to
exerts an  important  role  in  host inflammatory responses. It play a pivotal
role in  the  host  response  to  endotoxic  shock  and  appears to serve as a
pituitary "stress" hormone that regulates systemic inflammatory responses. MIF
is a  secreted  protein  of  115 residues which is not processed from a larger
precursor.

D-dopachrome tautomerase  [2]  is  a  mammalian cytoplasmic enzyme involved in
melanin biosynthesis  and  that  tautomerizes  D-dopachrome  with  concomitant
decarboxylation to  give  5,6-dihydroxyindole  (DHI).  It  is a protein of 117
residues highly related to MIF.

It must be noted that MIF binds glutathione and has been said to be related to
glutathione S-transferases. This assertion has been later disproved [3].

As a  signature  pattern  for  these  proteins, we selected a conserved region
located in the central section.

-Consensus pattern: [DE]-P-[CLV]-[APT]-x(3)-[LIVM]-x-S-[IS]-[GT]-x-[LIVM]-
                    [GST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
