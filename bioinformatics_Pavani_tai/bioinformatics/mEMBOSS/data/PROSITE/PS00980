* G-protein coupled receptors family 3 signatures and profile *
***************************************************************

Glutamate and  calcium  bind  to  G-protein  coupled    receptors  that, while
structurally similar to the majority of G-protein coupled receptors (R7G) (see
the relevant entry <PDOC00210>),  do not show any  similarity  at the level of
their sequence, thus representing a new family whose current known members are
listed below:

 - The  metabotropic  glutamate  receptors  which evoke a variety of function,
   such as  long-tern  potentiation,  memory  acquisition  and learning, etc.,
   through the modulation of intracellular effectors [1,2,3].  Currently there
   are eight known  subtypes  of  metabotropic glutamate  receptors; mGluR1 to
   mGluR8. The  subtypes  mGluR1  and mGluR5 are coupled to the stimulation of
   the phosphatidylinositol-calcium  second  messenger  system  while  mGluR2,
   mGluR3, mGluR4,  mGluR6,  mGluR7  and mGluR8 are coupled to G proteins that
   inhibit adenylate cyclase activity.
 - The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor [4]  which  sense changes in the
   extracellular concentration of calcium ions.  The activity of this receptor
   is coupled  to  the  stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol-calcium second
   messenger system.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZC506.4.

Structurally these receptors are composed of:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) A  very  large  hydrophilic extracellular region of about 540 to 600 amino
    acid  residues. This region contains 17 conserved cysteines which could be
    involved in disulfide bonds;
 c) A region of about 250 residues that  seem  to  contain seven transmembrane
    domains;
 d) A C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of variable length (50 to 350 residues).

There are quite a number of regions of high sequence conservation both  in the
N-terminal domain  and  in the region containing the transmembrane domains. We
have selected  three  of  these  conserved  regions as signature patterns. The
first one corresponds to a highly conserved hydrophobic segment in the central
part of  the  N-terminal  extracellular  region.  The  second corresponds to a
section that contains a cluster of six cysteines in the C-terminal part of the
extracellular domain.  The  last one corresponds to the C-terminal part of the
cytoplasmic loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains.

We also developed a profile which covers the seven transmembrane regions.
