* CBM3 (carbohydrate binding type-3) domain profile *
*****************************************************

Carbohydrate-binding  modules  (CBM)  have  been  classified into more than 40
families  according  to  sequence  homology [E1]. Several cellulolytic enzymes
share  a  conserved  region  of about 150 amino acid residues, the CBM3 domain
[1].  It  has been classified in three different subtypes, termed family IIIa,
IIIb and IIIc. The family IIIa (scaffoldin) and IIIb (mainly free enzymes) are
closely  similar  in  their primary structures and both types bind strongly to
crystalline  cellulose  [2,3].  Members  of  the  family  IIIc,  fails to bind
crystalline  cellulose,  but serves in a 'helper' capacity by feeding a single
incoming  cellulose  chain  into the active site of the neighbouring catalytic
module pending hydrolysis [4,5].

The  CBM3  domain  is  mainly  found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which
correspond  to a wide range  of  bacterial glycosyl hydrolases  like  family 9
(see <PDOC00511>), family 5 (see <PDOC00565>) and family 10 (see <PDOC00510>).

The  crystal  structure  of  CBM3  has  been  solved  (see <PDB:1NBC>) [2]. It
consists  of nine beta-strands which form a compact domain that has an overall
prismatic  shape.  It  is  arranged in two antiparallel beta-sheets that stack
face-to-face  to  form  a  beta sandwich with jelly roll topology. Two defined
surfaces,  located  on opposite sides of the molecule, contain conserved polar
and aromatic residues which are probably involved in the binding of the CBM to
cellulose  [2,3].  The  first  one forms a planar strip whereas the second one
forms a shallow groove.

Some proteins known to contain a CBM3 domain are listed below:

 - Clostridial  cellulosomal  scaffolding  proteins  cipA, cipC and cbpA. They
   promote the   binding   of  cellulose  to  the  catalytic  domains  of  the
   cellulolytic enzymes.
 - Bacterial   cellulases   A, B, F, G, I, N, Y, Z   (Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase)
   (EC 3.2.1.4).

The profile we developed covers the whole CBM3 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  CBM3  domain  is also known as cellulose-binding domain family III
 (CBD III).
