* Signal peptidases II signature *
**********************************

Signal peptidases (SPases) [1]  (also  known  as leader peptidases) remove the
signal peptides from secretory proteins.  In prokaryotes three types of SPases
are known: type I (gene lepB) which is responsible for  the  processing of the
majority  of  exported pre-proteins;  type II (gene lsp)  which  only  process
lipoproteins, and a third type involved in the processing of pili subunits.

SPase II   (EC 3.4.23.36),   also   known  as  lipoprotein  signal  peptidase,
recognizes a  conserved  sequence  and  cuts in front of a cysteine residue to
which a  glyceride-fatty  acid  lipid  is  attached.  SPase  II is an integral
membrane protein that is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane.

There are  a  number  of  conserved  regions  in the sequence of Spase II from
various bacteria  [2],  we  have  selected one of these regions as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[GASF]-[GA]-[GAST]-[LIVMTF]-[GAS]-N-[LVMFGIA]-
                    [LIVFYGT]-D-[RIK]-[LIVMFAC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family A8 in  the classification of peptidases
 [3,E1].
