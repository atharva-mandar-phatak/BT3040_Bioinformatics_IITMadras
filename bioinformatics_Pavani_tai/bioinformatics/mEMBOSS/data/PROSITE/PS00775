* Glycosyl hydrolases family 3 active site *
********************************************

It has been shown [1,2] that the following  glycosyl hydrolases can be, on the
basis of sequence similarities, classified into a single family:

 - Beta glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) from  the  fungi  Aspergillus wentii (A-3),
   Hansenula anomala,  Kluyveromyces  fragilis,  Saccharomycopsis  fibuligera,
   (BGL1 and BGL2), Schizophyllum commune and Trichoderma reesei (BGL1).
 - Beta glucosidases from  the  bacteria   Agrobacterium  tumefaciens  (Cbg1),
   Butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens (bglA),    Clostridium    thermocellum   (bglB),
   Escherichia coli  (bglX),  Erwinia  chrysanthemi  (bgxA)  and  Ruminococcus
   albus.
 - Alteromonas strain O-7 beta-hexosaminidase A (EC 3.2.1.52).
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yzbA.
 - Escherichica  coli  hypothetical protein ycfO and HI0959, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.

One of the conserved regions in  these enzymes  is  centered  on  a  conserved
aspartic acid  residue  which has been shown [3], in  Aspergillus wentii beta-
glucosidase A3, to be implicated in the catalytic mechanism. We have used this
region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-[KR]-x-[EQKRD]-x(4)-G-[LIVMFTC]-[LIVT]-[LIVMF]-
                    [ST]-D-x(2)-[SGADNIT]
                    [D is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
