* Mannitol dehydrogenases signature *
*************************************

The following dehydrogenases have been shown [1] to be evolutionary related:

 - Mannitol-1-phosphate  5-dehydrogenase    (EC 1.1.1.17)  (gene mtlD),  which
   catalyzes the NAD-dependent reduction of mannitol 1-phosphate into fructose
   6-phosphate.
 - Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.67)  (gene mtlK),  which  catalyzes  the
   NAD-dependent reduction of mannitol into fructose.
 - Mannonate  oxidoreductase  (EC  1.1.1.57)  (fructuronate  reductase)  (gene
   uxuB), which  catalyzes  the  NAD-dependent  reduction of fructuronate into
   mannonate.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydfI.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiQ.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YEL070w.

As a signature pattern, we  selected a conserved region located in the central
section of these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMY]-x-[FS]-x(2)-[STAGCV]-x-V-D-R-[IV]-x-[PS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
