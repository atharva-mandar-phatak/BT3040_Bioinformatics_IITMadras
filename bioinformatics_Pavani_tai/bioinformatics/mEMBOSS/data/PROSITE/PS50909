* GAT domain profile *
**********************

The GAT  domain  is  a  region of homology of ~130 residues, which is found in
eukaryotic GGAs  (for  Golgi-localized,  gamma ear-containing ADP ribosylation
factor (ARF)-binding  proteins)  and  vertebrate TOMs (for target of myb). The
GAT domain  is found in its entirety only in GGAs, although, at the C-terminus
it shares  partial  sequence  similarity  with a short region of TOMs. The GAT
domain is   found  in  association  with  other  domains,  such  as  VHS  (see
<PDOC50179>) and  GAE  (see  <PDOC50180>).  The GAT domain of GGAs serves as a
molecular anchor  of  GGA  to  trans-Golgi  network  (TGN)  membranes  via its
interaction with  the  GTP-bound  form  of a member of the ARF family of small
GTPases and  can bind specifically to the Rab GTPase effector rabaptin5 and to
ubiquitin [1,2,3,4,5].

The GGA-GAT  domain possesses an all alpha-helical structure, composed of four
helices arranged  in  a  somewhat  unusual topology, which has been called the
helical paper  clip (see <PDB:1NAF>). The overall structure shows that the GAT
domain has  an elongated shape, in which the longest helix participates in two
small independent  subdomains:  an  N-terminal  helix-loop-helix hook and a C-
terminal three-helix  bundle.  The  hook  subdomain  has been shown to be both
necessary and  sufficient for ARF-GTP binding and Golgi targeting of GGAs. The
N-terminal hook  subdomain  contains  a  hydrophobic  patch, which is found to
interact directly  with  ARF  [3].  It has been proposed that this interaction
might stabilize  the  hook subdomain [4]. The C-terminal three-helix bundle is
involved in the binding with Rabaptin5 and ubiquitin [5].

The profile we developed covers the entire GAT domain.
