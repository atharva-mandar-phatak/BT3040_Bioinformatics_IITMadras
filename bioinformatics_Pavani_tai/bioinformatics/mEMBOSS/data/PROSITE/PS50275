* Sac phosphatase domain profile *
**********************************

The Sac  domain is a region of homology between the N-terminus of synaptojanin
and the   otherwise   unrelated   yeast  protein  Sac1p.  The  Sac  domain  is
approximately 400 residues in length, and proteins containing this domain show
approximately 35%  identity with other Sac domains throughout this region. The
Sac domain  exhibits  phosphatidylinositol  polyphosphate phosphatase activity
and can  hydrolyse  phosphate from any of the three positions of inositol that
may be  phosphorylated  (3-,  4-  and  5).  However,  adjacent  phosphates are
resistant to   hydrolysis.   Sac   domains  cannot  hydrolyse  phosphate  from
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2),  or  PtdIns(3,4)P2,  or
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but can hydrolyse PtdIns(3,5)P2 [1,2].

The Sac  domain  consists  of  seven  highly  conserved motifs which appear to
define the  catalytic  and  regulatory  regions  of the phosphatase. The sixth
conserved region  contains  a highly conserved C-x(5)-R-[TS] motif, thought to
be the  catalytic  motif  of  many  metal-independent  protein  and  inositide
polyphosphate phosphatases.  Interestingly, the Inp51p Sac domain in which the
cysteine, arginine  and  threonine/serine  residues  within  the C-x(5)-R-[TS]
motif are absent, does not exhibit any phosphatase activity [1,2].

Two classes  of Sac domain proteins have been identified in mammals as well as
lower eukaryotes [1,2]. The first comprises proteins, which, in addition to an
N-terminal phosphatase  Sac  domain, have all the domains associated with type
II phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-phosphatases:

 - Mammalian   synaptojanins,   type   II  phosphatidylinositol  phosphate  5-
   phosphatases.
 - Yeast  INP51, a 108 kDa membrane protein. It is involved in endocytosis and
   regulation of  the actin cytoskeleton under conditions of normal vegetative
   growth. Although  the Sac phosphatase domain of INP51  may be catalytically
   inactive, the domain may retain other functions.
 - Yeast  INP52, a 133 kDa membrane protein. It is involved in endocytosis and
   regulation of  the actin cytoskeleton under conditions of normal vegetative
   growth.
 - Yeast  INP53,  a  124  kDa  membrane  protein. It appears to have a role in
   intra-Golgi and Golgi-to-endosomal trafficking.

The other class of Sac-containing phosphatases consists of proteins with an N-
terminal Sac phosphatase domain and no other recognizable domains:

 - Yeast  Sac1p,  a 67 kDa membrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum
   (ER) and  Golgi.  It  regulates  the  actin  cytoskeleton  and phospholipid
   metabolism.
 - Yeast   FIG4, a 101 kDa protein encoded by a pheromone regulated or induced
   gene. FIG4   might  function  to  regulate  effector molecules of the actin
   cytoskeleton during mating.

The profile we developed covers the seven highly conserved motifs found in Sac
domains.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
