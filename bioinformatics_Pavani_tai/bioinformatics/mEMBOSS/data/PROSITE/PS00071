********************************************************

Glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.1.12)  (GAPDH)  [1]  is  a
tetrameric NAD-binding enzyme common to both the  glycolytic and gluconeogenic
pathways. A cysteine in the middle of the  molecule  is  involved in forming a
covalent  phosphoglycerol  thioester intermediate.   The sequence  around this
cysteine is  totally  conserved   in  eubacterial and eukaryotic GAPDHs and is
also present, albeit in a  variant  form,  in  the  otherwise highly divergent
archaebacterial GAPDH [2].

Escherichia coli  D-erythrose  4-phosphate  dehydrogenase (E4PDH) (gene epd or
gapB) is an enzyme highly related to GAPDH [3].

-Consensus pattern: [ASV]-S-C-[NT]-T-{S}-x-[LIM]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Bacillus megaterium GAPDH which has  Pro instead of Ser in position 2  of
 the pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
