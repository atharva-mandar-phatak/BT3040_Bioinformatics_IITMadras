* Sodium:alanine symporter family signature *
*********************************************

It has  been shown [1] that integral membrane proteins that mediate the intake
of a  wide  variety  of  molecules  with the concomitant uptake of sodium ions
(sodium symporters)  can  be  grouped, on the basis of sequence and functional
similarities into  a  number  of  distinct  families. One of these families is
known as the  sodium:alanine  symporter family (SAF) and currently consists of
the following proteins:

 - Thermophilic bacterium PS-3 alanine carrier protein (ACP). ACP can use both
   sodium and hydrogen as a symport ion.
 - Alteromonas haloplanktis D-alanine/glycine permease (gene dagA).
 - Bacillus subtilis alsT.
 - Hypothetical   protein   yaaJ   from   Escherichia  coli  and  HI0183,  the
   corresponding Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0883.

These integral  membrane  proteins  are  predicted  to  comprise a least eight
membrane spanning  domains.    As  a  signature  pattern we selected a  highly
conserved region which is located in the N-terminal section and which includes
part of the first transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: G-G-x-[GA](2)-[LIVM]-F-W-M-W-[LIVM]-x-[STAV]-[LIVMFA](2)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
