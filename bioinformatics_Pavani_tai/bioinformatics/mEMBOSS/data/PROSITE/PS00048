* Protamine P1 signature *
**************************

Protamines are small, highly  basic  proteins, that substitute for histones in
sperm chromatin  during  the    haploid phase  of  spermatogenesis.  They pack
sperm  DNA into  a   highly  condensed, stable and inactive complex. There are
two different  types  of  mammalian  protamine,  called P1 and P2. P1 has been
found in  all species studied, while P2 is sometimes absent. There seems to be
a single  type of avian protamine whose sequence is closely related to that of
mammalian P1 [1].

As a signature  for this family of proteins, we selected a conserved region at
the N-terminal extremity of the sequence.

-Consensus pattern: [AV]-R-[NFY]-R-x(2,3)-[ST]-{S}-S-{NS}-S
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
