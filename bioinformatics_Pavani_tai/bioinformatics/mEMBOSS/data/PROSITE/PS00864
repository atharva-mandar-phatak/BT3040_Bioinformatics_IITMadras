* Calsequestrin signatures *
****************************

Calsequestrin is   a  moderate-affinity, high-capacity calcium-binding protein
of cardiac  and  skeletal muscle [1], where it is located in the lumenal space
of the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  terminal  cisternae.  Calsequestrin acts as a
calcium  buffer  and  plays  an important   role  in  the  muscle  excitation-
contraction coupling.  It  is  a highly acidic protein of about 400 amino acid
residues that  binds  more than 40 moles of calcium per mole of protein. There
are at  least two different forms of calsequestrin: one which is expressed  in
cardiac muscles  and  another  in  skeletal  muscles.  Both  forms have highly
similar sequences.

We have developed two signature sequences, the first one corresponds to the N-
terminus of  the  mature  protein;  the second is located just in front of the
C-terminus  of  the  protein  which is  composed  of  a  highly acidic tail of
variable length.
