*********************************************************

Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A  synthase  (EC  2.3.3.10) (HMG-CoA  synthase)
catalyzes the  condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to produce HMG-
CoA and CoA [1].

In vertebrates  there  are  two  isozymes  located  in  different  subcellular
compartments: a  cytosolic  form which is the starting point of the mevalonate
pathway which leads to cholesterol and other sterolic and isoprenoid compounds
and a  mitochondrial form responsible for ketone body biosynthesis. HMG-CoA is
also found in other eukaryotes such as insect, plants and fungi.

A cysteine  is  known to act as the catalytic nucleophile in the first step of
the reaction,  the  acetylation  of the enzyme by acetyl-CoA. We have used the
conserved region around this active site residue as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: N-x-[DN]-[IV]-E-G-[IV]-D-x(2)-N-A-C-[FY]-x-G
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2003 / Text revised.
