* Histidine acid phosphatases signatures *
******************************************

Acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.2)  are  a  heterogeneous group  of  proteins that
hydrolyze phosphate esters, optimally at low pH.  It has been shown [1] that a
number of acid phosphatases, from both  prokaryotes and eukaryotes,  share two
regions of  sequence  similarity,  each  centered around a conserved histidine
residue. These  two  histidines  seem to be involved in the enzymes' catalytic
mechanism [2,3].  The first histidine is located in the N-terminal section and
forms a  phosphohistidine  intermediate  while the second is located in the C-
terminal section  and possibly acts as proton donor. Enzymes belonging to this
family are called 'histidine acid phosphatases' and are listed below:

 - Escherichia coli pH 2.5 acid phosphatase (gene appA).
 - Escherichia coli glucose-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.10) (gene agp).
 - Yeast constitutive and repressible acid phosphatases (genes PHO3 and PHO5).
 - Fission yeast acid phosphatase (gene pho1).
 - Aspergillus phytases A and B (EC 3.1.3.8) (gene phyA and phyB).
 - Mammalian lysosomal acid phosphatase.
 - Mammalian prostatic acid phosphatase.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  proteins B0361.7, C05C10.1, C05C10.4
   and F26C11.1.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x(2)-[LIVMA]-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-R-H-[GN]-x-R-x-[PAS]
                    [H is the phosphohistidine residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-x-[LIVMFAG]-{T}-x-[STAGI]-H-D-[STANQ]-{V}-[LIVM]-
                    x(2)-[LIVMFY]-x(2)-[STA]
                    [H is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for rat prostatic acid  phosphatase  which  seems to  have Tyr instead of the
 active site His
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 14.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
