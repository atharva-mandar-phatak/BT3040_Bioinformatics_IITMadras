* Stonin homology domain (SHD) profile *
****************************************

Human stonins,  like  their  Drosophila  homologue stoned B are supposed to be
endocytotic proteins  involved  in  clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses.
The two   human   stonins,  as  well  as  their  Drosophila  melanogaster  and
Caenorhabditis elegans  homologues,  exhibit a modular structure consisting of
an N-terminal  proline-  and  serine-rich  domain,  a  central stonin homology
domain (SHD),  and a C-terminal domain homologous to the signal-binding domain
of the mu subunits of adaptor protein (AP) complexes (mu-homology domain) (see
<PDOC51072>). The  ~140 amino-acid SHD domain  has not been described in other
proteins and  may thus be unique to members of the stonin family. Its function
is not yet known [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire SHD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
