Urease  (EC  3.5.1.5) is a nickel-binding enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of  urea  to  carbon  dioxide  and ammonia [1]. Historically, it was the first
enzyme  to  be  crystallized  (in  1926).  It  is mainly found in plant seeds,
microorganisms  and invertebrates. In plants, urease is a hexamer of identical
chains. In bacteria [2], it consists of either two or three different subunits
(alpha, beta and gamma).

Urease  binds  two nickel ions per subunit; four histidine, an aspartate and a
carbamated-lysine serve as ligands to these metals; an additional histidine is
involved  in  the  catalytic  mechanism [3]. The urease domain forms an (alpha
beta)(8) barrel structure (see <PDB:2KAU>) with structural similarity to other
metal-dependent   hydrolases,   such  as  adenosine  and  AMP  deaminase  (see
<PDOC00419>) and phosphotriesterase (see <PDOC01026>).

As  signatures  for  this  enzyme,  we  selected  a  region  that contains two
histidines  that bind one of the nickel ions and the region of the active site
histidine. We also developed a profile that covers the whole urease domain.
