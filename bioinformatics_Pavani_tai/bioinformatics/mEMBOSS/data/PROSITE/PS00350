* MADS-box domain signature and profile *
*****************************************

A number of transcription factors  contain a conserved domain of 56 amino-acid
residues, sometimes known as the MADS-box domain. They are listed below:

 - Serum  response  factor  (SRF)  [1],  a mammalian transcription factor that
   binds to the Serum Response Element (SRE). This is a short sequence of dyad
   symmetry located 300 bp  to the 5' end of the transcription initiation site
   of genes such as c-fos.
 - Mammalian  myocyte-specific  enhancer  factors  2A  to 2D (MEF2A to MEF2D).
   These proteins  are  transcription  factor  which binds specifically to the
   MEF2 element  present  in  the  regulatory  regions of many muscle-specific
   genes.
 - Drosophila myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2).
 - Yeast  GRM/PRTF  protein  (gene  MCM1) [2], a  transcriptional regulator of
   mating-type-specific genes.
 - Yeast arginine metabolism regulation protein I (gene ARGR1 or ARG80).
 - Yeast transcription factor RLM1.
 - Yeast transcription factor SMP1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana  agamous  protein (AG) [3],  a  probable transcription
   factor  involved  in  regulating  genes  that  determines stamen and carpel
   development in wild-type flowers.   Mutations in  the AG gene result in the
   replacement of the stamens by petals and the carpels by a new flower.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  homeotic proteins Apetala1 (AP1), Apetala3 (AP3) and
   Pistillata (PI)  which  act  locally  to specify the identity of the floral
   meristem and to determine sepal and petal development [4].
 - Antirrhinum majus and tobacco homeotic protein deficiens (DEFA) and globosa
   (GLO) [5].  Both proteins are transcription factors involved in the genetic
   control of  flower  development.    Mutations  in  DEFA  or  GLO  cause the
   transformation of petals into sepals and of stamina into carpels.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana putative transcription factors AGL1 to AGL6 [6].
 - Antirrhinum majus morphogenetic protein DEF H33 (squamosa).

In SRF, the conserved domain has been shown [1] to  be involved in DNA-binding
and dimerization.  We have derived a pattern that spans the complete length of
the domain. The profile also spans the length of the MADS-box.
