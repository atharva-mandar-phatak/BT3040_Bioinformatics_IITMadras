* LIS1 homology (LisH) motif and C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) motif profiles *
***************************************************************************

The 33-residue LIS1 homology (LisH) motif is found in eukaryotic intracellular
proteins involved  in  microtubule dynamics, cell migration, nucleokinesis and
chromosome segregation.  The  LisH  motif  is  likely  to  possess a conserved
protein-binding function  and it has been proposed that LisH motifs contribute
to the  regulation  of microtubule dynamics, either by mediating dimerization,
or else  by  binding  cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain or microtubules directly.
The LisH  motif  is  found  associated  to  other  domains, such as WD-40 (see
<PDOC00574>), SPRY,  Kelch,  AAA  ATPase,  RasGEF,  or  HEAT (see <PDOC50077>)
[1,2,3].

The secondary  structure  of  the  LisH  domain  is predicted to be two alpha-
helices [1].

Some proteins known to contain a LisH motif are listed below:

 - Animal  LIS1.  It regulates cytoplasmic dynein function. In human, children
   with defects  in  LIS1  suffer  from  Miller-Dieker  lissencephaly, a brain
   malformation that  results  in  severe  retardation,  epilepsy and an early
   death.
 - Emericella nidulans nuclear migration protein nudF, the orthologue of LIS1.
 - Eukaryotic   RanBPM,   a   Ran  binding  protein  involved  in  microtubule
   nucleation.
 - Eukaryotic Nopp140, a nucleolar phosphoprotein.
 - Mammalian  treacle,  a  nucleolar protein. In human, defects in treacle are
   the cause  of  Treacher  Collins  syndrome  (TCS),  an  autosomal  dominant
   disorder of craniofacial development.
 - Animal  muskelin.  It acts as a mediator of cell spreading and cytoskeletal
   responses to the extracellular matrix component thrombospondin 1.
 - Animal transducin beta-like 1 protein (TBL1).
 - Plant tonneau.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  LEUNIG,  a putative transcriptional corepressor that
   regulates AGAMOUS expression during flower development.
 - Fungal aimless RasGEF.
 - Leishmania major katanin-like protein.

The C-terminal  to  LisH (CTLH) motif is a predicted alpha-helical sequence of
unknown function that is found adjacent to the LisH motif in a number of these
proteins but  is absent in other (e.g. LIS1) [1,2,3]. The CTLH domain can also
be found in the absence of the LisH motif, like in:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana hypothetical protein MUD21.5.
 - Yeast protein RMD5.

The profiles we developed cover respectively the entire LisH and CTLH motifs.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL LisH
 motifs.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
