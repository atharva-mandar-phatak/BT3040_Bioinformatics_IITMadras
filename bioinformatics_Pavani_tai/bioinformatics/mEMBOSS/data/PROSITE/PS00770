* Aminotransferases class-IV signature *
****************************************

Aminotransferases  share certain mechanistic features with   other  pyridoxal-
phosphate dependent enzymes, such as  the  covalent  binding of the pyridoxal-
phosphate group  to  a  lysine  residue.  On the basis of sequence similarity,
these various  enzymes  can  be  grouped [1,2] into subfamilies. One of these,
called class-IV, currently consists of the following enzymes:

 - Branched-chain amino-acid aminotransferase  (EC 2.6.1.42) (transaminase B),
   a bacterial   (gene   ilvE)  and  eukaryotic  enzyme  which  catalyzes  the
   reversible transfer  of  an  amino  group  from 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate to
   glutamate, to form leucine and 2-oxoglutarate.
 - D-alanine   aminotransferase   (EC  2.6.1.21).  A  bacterial  enzyme  which
   catalyzes the transfer of the amino group from D-alanine (and other D-amino
   acids) to 2-oxoglutarate, to form pyruvate and D-aspartate.
 - 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) lyase (gene pabC). A  bacterial enzyme that
   converts ADC into 4-aminobenzoate (PABA) and pyruvate.

The above enzymes  are  proteins of about 270  to 415 amino-acid residues that
share a few regions of sequence similarity.  Surprisingly, the  best conserved
region does not include the  lysine residue  to  which the pyridoxal-phosphate
group is  known  to  be  attached,  in  ilvE. The region we use as a signature
pattern is located some 40 residues at the C-terminus side of the PlP-lysine.
