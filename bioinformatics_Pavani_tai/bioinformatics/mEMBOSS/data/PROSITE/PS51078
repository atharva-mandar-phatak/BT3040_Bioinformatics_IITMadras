* IclR-type HTH and iclR effector binding domains profiles *
************************************************************

The  iclR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain of about 60 amino acids present in transcription regulators of the iclR
family,  involved  in carbon metabolism in eubacteria and archaea. The domains
are  named  after  Escherichia  coli  iclR  (isocitrate  lyase  regulator),  a
repressor   of   the   glyoxylate   bypass  operon  for  acetate  utilization.
Transcription  regulators  of  the  iclR  family  contain the DNA-binding wHTH
domain  in  the  N-terminal part. The C-terminal part contains a ~170 residues
regulatory  domain, termed Effector binding Domain (ED) as it may bind a small
effector  or  signal  molecule.  Most  iclR-type  transcription regulators are
repressors  of specific catabolic genes in the absence of specific substrates,
while excess of a specific effector triggers de-repression. IclR-like proteins
can  function  as  regulators  for small catabolites and aromatic hydrocarbons
metabolism, for control of sporulation and of virulence [1-3].

The   structure   of  Thermotoga  maritima  iclR  shows  that  the  N-terminal
DNA-binding domain is composed of three helices (H) and a beta-hairpin (B1-B2)
in  the  topology: H1-H2-H3-B1-B2 (see <PDB:1MKM>). The helix-turn-helix motif
comprises  helices  2  and 3; helix 3 is termed the recognition helix, like in
other  wHTHs  where  it binds the DNA major groove. The beta-hairpin is called
the  wing. C-terminal to the DNA-binding domain, helix 4 and a short loop form
a  linking  region.  The  C-terminal effector binding domain forms a structure
similar  to  that  of  versatile,  small molecule-binding GAF/PAS domains (see
<PDB:1TF1>) [4]. IclR-like regulators can form dimers or tetramers and seem
to recognize a short palindromic operator/promoter [2-4].

Some proteins known to contain an iclR-type HTH and effector binding domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  iclR,  a  repressor  of the aceBAK operon (also known as
   glyoxylate bypass operon) for acetate utilization.
 - Streptomyces  coelicolor  gylR,  a  repressor of the gylCABX operon for the
   glycerol    catabolism    pathway.   GylR   functions   glycerol-inducible,
   glucose-repressible, and also as a negative autoregulator.
 - Erwinia   chrysanthemi   kdgR,   a  repressor  of  the  genes  involved  in
   pectinolysis and in pectinase secretion.
 - Escherichia  coli  mhpR,  an  activator of the mhpRABCDEF operon coding for
   components of the 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate degradation pathway.
 - Acinetobacter strain ADP1 pcaU, a regulator of protocatechuate degradation.
   PcaU  functions  as  a repressor or an activator depending on the levels of
   the inducer protocatechuate, and autoregulatory.
 - Acinetobacter strain ADP1 pobR, a transcription activator of pobA, involved
   in the degradation of 4-hydroxybenzoate.

The profiles we developed span the entire DNA-binding iclR-type HTH domain and
the effector binding domain, the latter including the linker region.
