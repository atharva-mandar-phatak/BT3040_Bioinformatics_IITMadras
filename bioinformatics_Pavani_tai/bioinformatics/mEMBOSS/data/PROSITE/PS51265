* Zinc finger Dbf4-type profile *
*********************************

In  eukaryotes,  initiation  of  DNA  replication  requires  the  assembly  of
pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) on chromatin during the G1 phase. In the S
phase,  pre-RCs  are  activated  by  two protein kinases, Cdk2 and Cdc7, which
results in the loading of replication factors and the unwinding of replication
origins  by  the  MCM  helicase complex [1]. Cdc7 is a serine/threonine kinase
(see <PDOC00100>)that is conserved from yeast to human. It is regulated by its
association with a regulatory subunit, the Dbf4 protein. This complex is often
referred to as DDK (Dbf4-dependent kinase) [2].

DBF4  contains  an  N-terminal  BRCT domain (see <PDOC50172>) and a C-terminal
conserved  region  that  could  potentially  coordinate  one  zinc  atom,  the
DBF4-type  zinc  finger. The zinc finger is important for the interaction with
Cdc7 [3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire DBF4-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
