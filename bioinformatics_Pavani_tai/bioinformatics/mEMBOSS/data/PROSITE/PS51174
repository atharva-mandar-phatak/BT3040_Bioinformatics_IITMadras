* Barwin domain signatures and profile *
****************************************

Barwin [1] is a barley seed protein of 125 residues that binds weakly a chitin
analog. It contains six cysteines involved in disulfide bonds, as shown in the
following schematic representation.

'*': position of the patterns.

Barwin is closely related to the following proteins:

 - Hevein, a wound-induced protein found in the latex of rubber trees.
 - HEL, an Arabidopsis thaliana hevein-like protein [2].
 - Win1 and win2, two wound-induced proteins from potato.
 - Pathogenesis-related protein 4 from tobacco.

Hevein and the win1/2 proteins consist  of an N-terminal chitin-binding domain
followed by  a  barwin-like C-terminal domain of ~122 residues. Barwin and its
related proteins could be involved in a defense mechanism in plants [1].

The dominating structural feature of the barwin domain is a well-defined four-
stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, two parallel beta-sheets packed antiparallel
to each other and four short alpha-helices (see <PDB:1BW3>) [3].

As signature  patterns,  we selected two highly conserved regions that contain
some of  the  cysteines.  We  also  developed a profile that covers the entire
barwin domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-G-[KR]-C-L-x-V-x-N
                    [The 2 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: V-[DN]-Y-[EQD]-F-V-[DN]-C
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
