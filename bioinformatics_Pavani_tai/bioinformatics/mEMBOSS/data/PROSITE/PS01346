* Claudin family signature *
****************************

The claudins  [1]  are  a  family of integral membrane proteins that are major
components of  tight  junction  (TJ) strands. There are at least 17 members of
this family in mammals. The claudins are proteins of about 200 to 230 residues
that contains four conserved transmembrane domains.

As signature  pattern  for this family, we selected a conserved region located
in an extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane regions.

-Consensus pattern: [GN]-L-W-x(2)-C-x(7,9)-[STDENQH]-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.

-Note: The claudin  family  is  evolutionary related to the PMP-22 family (see
 <PDOC00939>).
