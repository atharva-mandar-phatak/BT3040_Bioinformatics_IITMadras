**************************************************
* pfkB family of carbohydrate kinases signatures *
**************************************************

It has  been  shown [1,2,3] that the following carbohydrate and purine kinases
are evolutionary  related  and  can  be grouped into a single family, which is
known [1] as the 'pfkB family':

 - Fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) (gene scrK).
 - 6-phosphofructokinase isozyme 2 (EC 2.7.1.11) (phosphofructokinase-2) (gene
   pfkB). pfkB is a minor phosphofructokinase isozyme in Escherichia coli  and
   is not  evolutionary  related  to  the  major  isozyme (gene pfkA).  Plants
   6-phosphofructokinase also belong to this family.
 - Ribokinase (EC 2.7.1.15) (gene rbsK).
 - Adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) (gene ADK).
 - 2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase (EC 2.7.1.45) (gene: kdgK).
 - 1-phosphofructokinase   (EC 2.7.1.56)  (fructose 1-phosphate kinase)  (gene
   fruK).
 - Inosine-guanosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.73) (gene gsk).
 - Tagatose-6-phosphate  kinase  (EC  2.7.1.144)  (phosphotagatokinase)  (gene
   lacC).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiC.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiI.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhfQ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihV.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxdC.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR105w.

All the above kinases are proteins of from 280 to 430 amino acid residues that
share a few region  of sequence similarity.   We  have selected  two of  these
regions as signature patterns.  The  first  pattern  is based on a region rich
in glycine which is located in the N-terminal  section of these enzymes; while
the second pattern is based on a conserved region in the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-G-x(0,1)-[GAP]-x-N-{AGLS}-[STA]-x(2)-{A}-x-{G}-
                    {GNKA}-[GS]-x(9)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ADK,  gsk, kdgK, yeast ribokinase and YJR105w, B.subtilis yxdC and E.coli
 yihV.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 33.

-Consensus pattern: [DNSK]-[PSTV]-x-[SAG](2)-[GD]-D-x(3)-[SAGV]-[AG]-
                    [LIVMFYA]-[LIVMSTAP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.

-Note: Some bacterial fructokinases belong to the ROK family <PDOC00866>.
