* Fido domain profile *
***********************

The following   proteins   share   a   globular  domain  named  fido  that  is
approximately 125  to 150 residues long and is present in all kingdoms of life
[1,2,3,4]:

 - Fic  (filamentation  induced  by cAMP) from diverse bacteria. It contains a
   longer insert in the fido domain.
 - Doc  (death  on  curing)  proteins  from phage P1 and several bacteria. All
   these proteins contain a minimal stand-alone version of the fido domain.
 - HypE  (Huntingtin  associated  protein  E)  from animal. In humans, HypE is
   thought to  interact  with  Huntingtin,  one  of  the major proteins in the
   Huntington's disease  protein interaction network. Proteins related to HypE
   are also  found in several bacteria and some archaea. HypE proteins contain
   a longer  insert  in  their  fido  domain  and  are  typically  multidomain
   proteins.
 - Type IV secretion system effector AnkX from Legionella.
 - VopS,  a  type  III  secretion  system  effector  from  Vibrio  that causes
   eukaryotic cell cytotoxicity.
 - IbpA  (virulence  factor  p76)  from  Haemophilus somnus. It includes an N-
   terminal haemagglutination   activity   domain,  two  fido  domains  and  a
   peptidase C58 domain.
 - BepA,  an  anti-apoptotic  bacterial  effector  protein, which is a type IV
   secretion system substrate.

The fido  domain  of Vibrio VopS covalently modifies Rho GTPase threonine with
AMP to  inhibit  downstream  signaling  events  in  host cells. The AMPylation
activity extends  to  a  eukaryotic  fido  domain  in Drosophila fic homologue
CG9523. AMPylation    represents    a   newly   discovered   posttranslational
modification used to stably modify proteins with AMP. This signaling mechanism
is predicted to be functionally similar to other posttranslation modifications
such as  phosphorylation, SUMOylation or acetylation, because the added moiety
changes the  activity  of the modified protein. The covalent attachment of AMP
by a  phosphodiester bond is predicted to be reversible and is bulky enough to
provide a docking site for a putative AMP binding domain [4].

The fido domain contains a central motif conserved in most sequences (H-x-F-x-
[DE]-[AG]-N-[GK]-R), with  the  motif  His contributing to fic AMPylation. The
fido domain  adopts an alpha-helical fold, arranged as a six-helix up and down
bundle (see <PDB:2F6S>) [2,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire fido domain.
