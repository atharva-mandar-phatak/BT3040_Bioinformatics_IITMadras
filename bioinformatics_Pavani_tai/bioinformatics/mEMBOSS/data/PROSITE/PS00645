*****************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located in  the  inner mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there is  one  with a  molecular  weight  of 51 Kd (in mammals), which is  the
second largest subunit of complex I and is a component of the iron-sulfur (IP)
fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind to NAD, FMN, and a 4Fe-4S cluster.

The 51 Kd subunit is highly similar to [3,4]:

 - Subunit alpha of Alcaligenes eutrophus NAD-reducing hydrogenase (gene hoxF)
   which also binds to NAD, FMN, and a 4Fe-4S cluster.
 - Subunit NQO1 of Paracoccus denitrificans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
 - Subunit F of Escherichia coli NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoF).

The 51 Kd subunit and  the bacterial  hydrogenase alpha subunit contains three
regions of sequence similarities.  The  first one most probably corresponds to
the NAD-binding site, the  second to  the FMN-binding site, and the third one,
which contains three cysteines,  to  the  iron-sulfur binding region.  We have
developed signature  patterns for  the  FMN-binding and for the 4Fe-4S binding
regions.
