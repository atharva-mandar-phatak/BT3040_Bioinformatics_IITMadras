* Avidin-like domain signature and profile *
********************************************

Avidin [1]  is a minor constituent of egg white in several groups of oviparous
vertebrates.  Avidin,  which was discovered in the 1920's, takes its name from
the  avidity  with which it binds biotin. These two molecules bind so strongly
that is highly difficult to separate them. Streptavidin is  a protein produced
by Streptomyces  avidinii    which    also  binds biotin and whose sequence is
evolutionary related to that of avidin.

Avidin and streptavidin both  form  homotetrameric  complexes of noncovalently
associated chains.  Each  chain  forms a very strong and specific non-covalent
complex with one molecule of biotin.

Fibropellins I and III [2] are proteins that form the apical lamina of the sea
urchin embryo,  a  component  of  the extracellular matrix. These two proteins
have a  modular structure composed of a CUB domain (see <PDOC00908>), followed
by a variable number of EGF repeats (see <PDOC00021>) and a C-terminal avidin-
like domain. The fibropellin avidin-like domain forms a homotetramer incapable
of binding biotin [3].

The three-dimensional  structures  of  both  streptavidin [4,5] and avidin [6]
have been  determined  and  revealed  them  to  share  a common fold: an eight
stranded anti-parallel  beta-barrel  with  a repeated +1 topology enclosing an
internal ligand binding site (see <PDB:1AVD>).

As a  signature  sequence  for  the avidin-like domain we selected a conserved
motif located  in  its  C-terminal  section.  We also developed a profile that
covers the entire avidin-like domain.

-Consensus pattern: [DENY]-x(2)-[KRI]-[STA]-x(2)-V-G-x-[DN]-x-[FW]-T-[KR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: It  is  suggested, on the basis of similarities of structure, function,
 and sequence,    that  this  family  forms an overall superfamily, called the
 calycins, with the lipocalin <PDOC00187> and the cytosolic fatty-acid binding
 proteins <PDOC00188> families [7,8].
