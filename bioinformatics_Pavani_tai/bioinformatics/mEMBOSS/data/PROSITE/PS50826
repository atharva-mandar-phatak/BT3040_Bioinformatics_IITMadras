* RUN domain profile *
**********************

The RUN  domain,  named  after  RPIP8, unc-14 and NESCA, is organized into six
conserved blocks  (A-F),  which  are  predicted  to constitute the 'core' of a
globular structure  tolerating  insertions  of considerable length between the
conserved blocks.  The  RUN  domain  is  found in one or two copies in several
proteins that  are  linked particularly to the functions of GTPases in the Rap
and Rab  families.  RUN  domains  can  be  associated  with  TBC/rab  GAP (see
<PDOC50086>), FYVE  (see  <PDOC50178>),  DENN,  SH3 (see <PDOC50002>), DAG/PE-
binding (see   <PDOC00379>),   PLAT/LH2,  PH  (see  <PDOC50003>)  or  PX  (see
<PDOC50195>) domains.  The  RUN  domain  may have a role in the interaction of
various proteins with cytoskeletal filaments [2].

The predicted   secondary  structures  of  the  RUN  domain  core  indicate  a
predominantly alpha fold [1].

Some proteins known to contain a RUN domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Rap2 interacting protein 8 (RPIP8). A probable specific effector
   of the   small  GTP-binding  protein  Rap2  in  cells  exhibiting  neuronal
   properties.
 - Human   Nesca   (new   molecule  containing  SH3  at  the  C-terminus),  an
   ubiquitously expressed protein.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans unc-14, a protein required for axonal elongation and
   guidance that interacts with the serine/threonine kinase unc-51.
 - Mouse  GTP-binding  protein-associated protein B (GBPAP-B), a protein found
   in yeast  two-hybrid screen with Rab6 and which specifically interacts with
   this GTPase bound to GTP. It contains two RUN domains.

The profile we developed covers the entire RUN domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
