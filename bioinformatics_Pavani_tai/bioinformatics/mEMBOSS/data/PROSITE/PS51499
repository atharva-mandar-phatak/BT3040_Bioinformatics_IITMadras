ACCUMULATION OF  PHOTOSYSTEM  ONE1  (APO1)  is  required  for  accumulation of
photosystem I (PSI) and other plastid-encoded [4FE-4S] cluster proteins of the
chloroplast. APO1  belongs  to a gene family with four defined groups (APO1 to
APO4) only  found  in  nuclear  genomes of vascular plants. Members of the APO
gene family  are  present  in both monocotyledonae and dicotydiledonae and are
predicted to  be localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria. APO1 to APO4 show
much fewer  similarities  in  the N terminus than in the remaining part of the
proteins, indicating  different  localizations  and/or  functions. Each of the
groups, APO1  to  APO4,  displays  distinct  and conserved features suggesting
that they  are  all important for the plant cell and possess related functions
in different cellular compartments [1].

All members of the APO gene family contain an ~100 amino acid residue-spanning
region (APO  motif 1) with conserved Cys, His, Gly, and acidic and basic amino
acids. This  highly  conserved  APO1  motif  is  duplicated  at the C terminus
(designated APO  motif  2).  The  two  motifs are separated by a non-conserved
spacer of  variable  length.  The  conserved  Cys in both motifs could provide
ligands for  tetranuclear  Fe-S centers. Several conserved differences between
the two  motifs  could indicate different functions. For example, both motifs,
APO 1  and  2,  contain  a  conserved  H in another positions. Two conserved R
residues are  present  in  APO  motif  1  and  two  K  residues in motif 2. In
addition, APO  motif 2 contains conserved G, VW, YG, and A residues, which are
not present in APO motif 1 in any of the groups [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire APO domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
