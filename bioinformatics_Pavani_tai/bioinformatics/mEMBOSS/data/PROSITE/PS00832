* 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthases signatures and profile *
*********************************************************

2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthases  [1]  constitute a family of interferon-induced
enzymes that bind double-stranded  RNA (dsRNA) and  polymerizes ATP into 2'-5'
linked oligomers of adenosine (pppA(2'p5'A)n) (2-5A) of various lengths.   The
2-5A molecules activate a  latent  ribonuclease (Rnase L)  that  then  cleaves
single-stranded  RNAs; as  a result  protein  synthesis  and  virus growth are
inhibited. Thus  2-5A synthases play an important role in the antiviral action
of interferons.

Three distinct  classes  of 2-5A synthases have been described that correspond
to proteins  of  40-46  Kd,  69-71  Kd, and 100 Kd. The 40 and 46 Kd forms are
produced by alternative splicing of the same gene. The 69  and 71 Kd forms are
also produced by alternative  splicing of a gene and  consist  of two adjacent
homologous domains whose sequences are  highly similar to that of the 40/46 Kd
forms. The sequence of the 100 Kd form is not yet known.

We  developed  two  signature patterns for these enzymes.   The  first spans a
region rich in glycine  residues which has been proposed [2] to be part of the
ATP-binding site.  The  second  signature  corresponds  to  a highly conserved
region located in the C-terminal part of 2-5A synthases proteins or domains.
