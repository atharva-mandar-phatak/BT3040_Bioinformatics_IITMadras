* UvrC family homology region 1 and 2 profiles *
************************************************

In   prokaryote,  nucleotide  excision  repair,  DNA  damage  recognition  and
processing are  achieved  by  the  action  of the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC protein
complex [1].

UvrC  proteins contain 4 conserved regions: the UVR domain which interact with
uvrB  (see  <PDOC50151>),  a  Helix hairpin Helix (HhH) domain important for 5
prime  incision of damage DNA and the homology regions 1 (N-terminal part) and
2  (central  part) of unknown function. UvrC homology region 2 is specific for
UvrC  proteins,  whereas  UvrC  homology  region 1 is also shared by few other
nucleases.

Proteins that contain the UvrC homology region 1 are listed below.

 - Prokaryotic uvrC proteins.
 - Bacteriophage   T4   Endonuclease   II   protein.   Small  subunit  of  the
   ribonucleotide reductase enzyme.
 - Bacteriophage  T4 Intron-associated endonuclease 1 protein. An endonuclease
   specific  to  the  thymidylate  synthase  (td) gene splice  junction and is
   involved in intron homing.
 - Mycobacterium   tuberculosis   hypothetical   protein  Rv2191,  a  putative
   exonuclease.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yurQ.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile profiles: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
