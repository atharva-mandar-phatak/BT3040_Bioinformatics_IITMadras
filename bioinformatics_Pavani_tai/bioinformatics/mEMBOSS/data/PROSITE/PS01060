* Flagella transport protein fliP family signatures *
*****************************************************

In Escherichia coli and related proteins the fliP protein probably [1] plays a
role in the transport of flagellar proteins.  FliP is a protein of about 30 Kd
which contains  three  or  four  transmembrane  regions. Proteins evolutionary
related to  fliP  have  been  found  in  a wide range of bacteria (mopC, hrcR,
hrpW, spaP,  yscR,  etc.)  and  are  involved  in  a variety of signal-peptide
independent secretion systems.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for  this  family  of  proteins. These
patterns are  located  in  the  C-terminal  part of these proteins and overlap
with parts of the last two transmembrane regions.

-Consensus pattern: [PA]-[AS]-[FY]-x-[LIVT]-[STH]-[EQ]-[LI]-x(2)-[GA]-F-
                    [KREQ]-[IM]-[GV]-[LIF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: P-[LIVMF]-K-[LIVMF](5)-x-[LIVMA]-[DNGS]-G-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
