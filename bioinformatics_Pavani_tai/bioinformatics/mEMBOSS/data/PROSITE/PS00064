***************************************

L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) (LDH) [1]  catalyzes the reversible NAD-
dependent interconversion of pyruvate to L-lactate.  In vertebrate muscles and
in lactic  acid bacteria it represents the final step in anaerobic glycolysis.
This tetrameric enzyme is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In
vertebrates there  are  three  isozymes  of  LDH:  the  M  form (LDH-A), found
predominantly in muscle tissues; the H form (LDH-B), found in heart muscle and
the X  form  (LDH-C),  found  only in the spermatozoa of mammals and birds. In
birds and  crocodilian eye lenses, LDH-B serves as a structural protein and is
known as epsilon-crystallin [2].

L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (L-hicDH) [3]  catalyzes the
reversible and stereospecific  interconversion  between 2-ketocarboxylic acids
and L-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids. L-hicDH is evolutionary related to LDH's.

As a signature for LDH's we have  selected  a region that includes a conserved
histidine which is essential to the catalytic mechanism.
