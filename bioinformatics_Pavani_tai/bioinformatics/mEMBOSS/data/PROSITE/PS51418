********************************

Small  GTPases  form  an  independent  superfamily  within the larger class of
regulatory  GTP  hydrolases. This superfamily contains proteins that control a
vast  number  of  important  processes  and  possess  a  common,  structurally
preserved  GTP-binding  domain [1,2]. Sequence comparisons of small G proteins
from  various  species  have  revealed  that  they  are  conserved  in primary
structures at the level of 30-55% similarity [3].

Crystallographic analysis of various small G proteins revealed the presence of
a  20  kDa  catalytic  domain  that  is  unique for the whole superfamily (see
<PDB:5P21>)  [2,4].  The  domain  is  built of five alpha helices (A1-A5), six
beta-strands   (B1-B6)  and  five  polypeptide  loops  (G1-G5).  A  structural
comparison  of  the  GTP-  and  GDP-bound  form, allows one to distinguish two
functional   loop   regions:   switch  I  and  switch  II  that  surround  the
gamma-phosphate  group of the nucleotide. The G1 loop (also called the P-loop)
that connects the B1 strand and the A1 helix is responsible for the binding of
the  phosphate  groups. The G3 loop provides residues for Mg(2+) and phosphate
binding  and is located at the N-terminus of the A2 helix. The G1 and G3 loops
are  sequentially  similar  to  Walker  A and Walker B boxes that are found in
other  nucleotide binding motifs. The G2 loop connects the A1 helix and the B2
strand  and  contains  a conserved Thr residue responsible for Mg(2+) binding.
The  guanine base is recognized by the G4 and G5 loops. The consensus sequence
NKXD  of  the  G4 loop contains Lys and Asp residues directly interacting with
the  nucleotide.  Part  of  the  G5  loop  located between B6 and A5 acts as a
recognition site for the guanine base [5].

The small GTPase superfamily can be devided in 8 different families:

 - Arf  small GTPases. GTP-binding proteins involved in protein trafficking by
   modulating vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi apparatus.
 - Ran  small  GTPases.  GTP-binding  proteins  involved  in nucleocytoplasmic
   transport.  Required  for  the import of proteins into the nucleus and also
   for RNA export.
 - Rab small GTPases. GTP-binding proteins involved in vesicular traffic.
 - Rho   small   GTPases.   GTP-binding  proteins  that  control  cytoskeleton
   reorganization.
 - Ras small GTPases. GTP-binding proteins involved in signaling pathways.
 - Sar1  small  GTPases. Small GTPase component of the coat protein complex II
   (COPII)  which  promotes  the  formation  of  transport  vesicles  from the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
 - Mitochondrial  Rho  (Miro).  Small  GTPase  domain  found  in mitochondrial
   proteins involved in mitochondrial trafficking.
 - Roc  small GTPases domain. Small GTPase domain always found associated with
   the COR domain.

The  various  small  GTPase  family  profiles  cover  the  whole  catalyticaly
conserved region.
