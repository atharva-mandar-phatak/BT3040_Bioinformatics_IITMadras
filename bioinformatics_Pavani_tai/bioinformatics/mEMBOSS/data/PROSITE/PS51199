* Superfamily 4 helicase domain profile *
*****************************************

Helicases  have  been  classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5) [1]. All of the
proteins  bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A
(phosphate-binding   loop   or   P-loop)   (see   <PDOC00017>)  and  Walker  B
(Mg2+-binding  aspartic  acid)  motifs [1]. Superfamily 4 helicase, related to
bacterial  dnaB  proteins,  comprises  a  relatively  small  compact family of
proteins  containing,  in addition to Walker A and B, three distinct conserved
motifs  which  are  not  present  in  other  helicase  superfamilies. SF4 is a
hexameric  helicase  that  function  mainly  in bacterial or bacteriophage DNA
replication.   It   is  intimately  associated  with  other  proteins  of  the
replication fork. The helicase domain assembles into ring-shaped hexamers that
encircle  the  lagging  strand  of  the replication fork, moving in a 5' to 3'
direction and displacing the complementary DNA strand in an unwinding reaction
that is powered by nucleotide hydrolysis [2,3].

Several  bacteriophage  SF4  helicase  domains  have been crystalized (see for
example  <PDB:1CR0>)  [4].  The  central  core  is  similar  to the alpha-beta
RecA-like  domain. The functional enzyme is arranged in a ring-shaped hexamer.
A  nucleotide  binds in the crevice formed between adjacent subunits, where an
arginine  that  is analogous to the arginine finger motif of GTPase-activating
proteins  (see  <PDOC50238>)  could  trans-activate  the  bound nucleotide for
hydrolysis.  This  nucleotide-binding  site  at  the interface of two helicase
domains  is  also  a  feature  of  other DNA helicase such as PcrA, Rep or NS3
proteins, and it could be a general mechanism for DNA unwinding activity [4].

Some proteins known to contain an SF4 helicase domain are listed below [5,6]:

 - Bacterial  dnaB protein. It unwinds the DNA duplex ahead of the replication
   fork  and  is  also  responsible  for  attracting  the  dnaG primase to the
   replication fork.
 - Bacteriophage   T7  gp4  and  bacteriophage  T4  gp41  proteins.  They  are
   bifunctional  primase-helicases  that  unwind duplex DNA at the replication
   fork  while  initiating  the  synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging
   strand.
 - Metazoan  Twinkle  proteins.  In  human, Twinkle  is a helicase involved in
   mitochondrial DNA replication. It has been implicated in autosomal dominant
   progressive  external  ophthalmoplegia  (adPEO),  a  mitochondrial disorder
   characterized by mtDNA deletions [7].
 - Several  Cryptophyta  and  Viridiplantae  hypothetical  proteins  that also
   contain a primase domain.
 - Several  protozoan hypothetical proteins that also contain a primase domain
   or an exonuclease domain.
 - Rhodophyta chloroplastic dnaB-like proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire SF4 helicase domain.
