* CRISP family signature *
**************************

A variety  of  extracellular  proteins  from  eukaryotes have been found to be
evolutionary related.  They  have been termed cysteine-rich secretory proteins
(CRISP). Some relevant members of this family are:

 - Rodent  sperm-coating  glycoprotein (SCP), also  known as acidic epididymal
   glycoprotein (AEG) .  This  protein  is  thought  to  be  involved in sperm
   maturation [1]. It is a protein of about 220 residues and probably contains
   eight disulfide bonds.
 - Mammalian  testis-specific  protein  Tpx-1  [2]. Tpx-1 is highly related to
   SCP's.
 - Mammalian glioma pathogenesis-related protein (GliPR).
 - Lizard helothermine, a toxin that blocks ryanodine receptors.
 - Venom  allergen 5  (Ag5)  from vespid wasps and venom allergen 3 (Ag3) from
   fire ants.  These  proteins  are potent allergens and are the main cause of
   allergic reactions  to  stings  from insects of the hymenoptera family [3].
   Ag5/3 are proteins of about 200 residues and  contain four disulfide bonds.
 - Plant  pathogenesis  proteins  of  the  PR-1 family [4]. These proteins are
   synthesized during  pathogen  infection  or other stress-related responses.
   They are proteins of about 130 to 140 residues  and  probably contain three
   disulfide bonds.
 - Proteins  Sc7  and Sc14 from the basidomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune.
   These extracellular  proteins are loosely associated with fruit body hyphal
   walls [5].  Sc7/14  are proteins of about 180 residues and probably contain
   two disulfide bonds.
 - Ancylostoma secreted protein from dog hookworm.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YJL078c, YJL079c and YKR013w.

The exact function of these proteins is not yet known.  As signature patterns,
we selected two conserved regions located in their C-terminal half. The second
signature contains a  cysteine  which is known  to be involved  in a disulfide
bond in Ag5.

-Consensus pattern: [GDER]-[HR]-[FYWH]-[TVS]-[QA]-[LIVM]-[LIVMA]-W-x(2)-[STN]

                    [LIVMFYWDN]
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 4 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
