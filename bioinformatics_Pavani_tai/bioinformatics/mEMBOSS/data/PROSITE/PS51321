* TFIIS central domain profile *
********************************

Transcription factor  IIS  (TFIIS)  is  a transcription elongation factor that
increases the  overall transcription rate of RNA polymerase II by reactivating
transcription elongation  complexes that have arrested transcription. TFIIS is
a modular  factor  that  comprises  an  N-terminal domain (see <PDOC51319>), a
central domain, and a C-terminal TFIIS-type zinc finger (see <PDOC00383>). The
central domain  is  conserved  in  TFIIS  homologues  and  interacts  with RNA
polymerase II [1,2].

The TFIIS  central  domain comprises a bundle of three helices [1,2] and three
short helices,  which  form  upon Pol II interaction [3] (see <PDB:1PQV>). The
three-helix bundle  is  built  around  a  hydrophobic core composed largely of
three tyrosines  protruding  from  one  face  of the C-terminal helix [1]. The
TFIIS domain  is  separated  from the TFIIS-type zinc finger by an interdomain
linker [1],  which  is  unstructured  in  free TFIIs [2]. Upon Pol II binding,
however, the  linker  forms an alpha-helix, which runs along the Pol II bottom
face [3].

The profile we developed covers the TFIIS central domain and the linker alpha-
helix.
