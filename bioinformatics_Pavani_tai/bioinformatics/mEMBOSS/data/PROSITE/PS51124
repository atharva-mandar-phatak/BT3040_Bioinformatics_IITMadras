* Peptidase family C16 domain profile *
***************************************

Peptidase  family  C16  (EC  3.4.22.-)  contains  the  coronaviruses  cysteine
endopeptidases   involved   in   viral   polyprotein   processing   [E1].  All
coronaviruses  encodes between one and two accessory cysteine proteinases that
recognize  and  process  one  or  two  sites in the amino-terminal half of the
replicase  polyprotein  during assembly of the viral replication complex. MHV,
HCoV   and   TGEV   encode  two  accesssory  proteinases,  called  coronavirus
papain-like  proteinase  1  and  2 (PL1-PRO and PL2-PRO). IBV and SARS encodes
only one called PL-PRO [1]. Coronaviruses papain-like proteinases 1 and 2 have
restricted  specificities,  cleaving  respectively  two  and one bond(s)in the
polyprotein.  This  restricted  activity  may  be  due to extended specificity
sites:  Arg  or  Lys at the cleavage site position P5 are required for PL1-PRO
[2],  and  Phe  at  the cleavage site position P6 is required for PL2-PRO [3].
PL1-PRO  releases  p28 and p65 from the N-terminus of the polyprotein; PL2-PRO
cleaves between p210 and p150.

The  peptidase  family  C16  domain  is  about 260 amino acids in length. This
domain is predicted to have an alpha-beta structural organisation known as the
papain-like  fold.  It  consists  of  three alpha-helices and three strands of
antiparallel  beta-sheet [4]. This domain has a catalytic dyad consisting of a
Cys  and  a  downstream  His [1,2,4]. The nucleophilic Cys occurs in the motif
Asn-Cys-Xaa-Yaa in which Xaa is an aromatic, hydrophobic residue and Yaa is an
aliphatic  hydrophobic  amino  acid.  There  is little conservation around the
general base His. This peptidase domain also contains Cys residues involved in
the  formation of a zinc-binding finger which connects the left and right hand
domains  of  a  papain-like  fold, and may be involved in substrate binding or
control the movement of the catalytic domain [4].

Some proteins known to contain a peptidase C16 domain are listed below:

 - Murine  hepatitis  coronavirus  (MHV)  papain-like  endopeptidase 2  (PLP2)
   (C16.006) [3,5].
 - Human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E papain-like endopeptidase 1 (C16.002) [4].
 - Murine  hepatitis  coronavirus  (MHV)  papain-like  endopeptidase 1  (PLP1)
   (C16.001) [6].
 - Porcine  epidemic   diarrhea   virus   (PEDV)  papain-like  endopeptidase 1
   (C16.003) [7].
 - Avian  infectious  bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) papain-like endopeptidase 1
   (C16.005) [8].
 - SARS coronavirus papain-like endopeptidase (C16.009) [9].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
