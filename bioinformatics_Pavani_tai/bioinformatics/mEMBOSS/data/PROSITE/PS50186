* DEP domain profile *
**********************

The DEP domain is a globular domain of about 80 residues that is found in more
than  50  proteins involved in G protein signaling pathways. It has been named
after the three proteins (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin) in which it was
initially  identified [1]. It has been proposed that the DEP domain could play
a  selective  role  in  targeting  DEP  domain-containing proteins to specific
subcellular  membranous  sites,  perhaps  even  to  specific G protein-coupled
signaling pathways [2,3].

Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  has  revealed  that the DEP domain
comprises  a  three-helix  bundle,  a beta-hairpin 'arm' composed of two beta-
strands and two short beta-strands in the C-terminal region [3].

Representative example of proteins containing DEP domains are listed below:

 - Drosophila  and  vertebrate dishevelled (Dsh and Dvl), proteins that play a
   key role  in the transduction of the Wg/Wnt signal from the cell surface to
   the nucleus.
 - Vertebrate   Pleckstrin,  the  major  substrate  of  protein  kinase  C  in
   platelets. Pleckstrin  contains  two  PH domains (see <PDOC50003>) flanking
   the DEP domain.
 - Mammalian  regulator  of  G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins 6, 7, 9 and 11
   (see <PDOC50132>).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  egl-10,  which  regulates  G  protein signaling in
   nervous system.

The profile we developed covers the entire DEP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
