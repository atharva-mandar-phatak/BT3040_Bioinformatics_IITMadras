* BRX domain profile *
**********************

BREVIS RADIX (BRX) controls the extent of cell proliferation and elongation in
the growth  zone  of the root type. BRX is a member of a small group of highly
conserved proteins,   the   BRX   protein  family,  which  is  only  found  in
multicellular plants.  Four  regions of high conservation can be distinguished
in BRX  family  proteins.  BRX  family  proteins contain four highly conserved
domains of  initially  unknown  function;  most  characteristically,  a tandem
repeat of  55  amino  acids  termed  the  BRX  domain, which has been shown to
mediate homo-  and heterotypic protein-protein interactions. The BRX domain is
predicted to form an alpha-helical structure. Despite the high degree of amino
acid similarity  between  BRX  family proteins, molecular and genetic analyses
revealed that  only  BRX  is  involved  in  root growth, indicating functional
diversification [1,2,3,4].

The BRX  domain,  which  has also been named the DZC (disease resistance, zinc
finger, chromosome condensation) domain, also occurs in the following proteins
of Arabidopsis [2,4]:

 - PRAF family proteins. PRAF family proteins contain other conserved domains,
   such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) (see <PDOC50003>) and FYVE zinc-finger
   (see <PDOC50178>)  domains, which are assumed to bind phosphoinositides and
   target proteins  to  the  plasma  membrane. PRAF-like proteins also contain
   regulator of  chromosome  condensation  1 (RCC1) (see <PDOC00544>) repeats,
   which are  implicated  in  multiple  cellular processes. RCC1 repeats often
   provide guanine nucleotide exchange activity.
 - RLM3,  a  resistance  (R)  protein,  which could act as a potential adaptor
   between specific  TIR-NB-ARC-LRR  receptors  and  BRX proteins. It contains
   other domains such as TIR (see <PDOC50104>) and NB-ARC.

The profile we developed covers the entire BRX domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
