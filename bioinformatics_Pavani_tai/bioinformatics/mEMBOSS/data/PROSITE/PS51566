* Class V SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
************************************************************

Methyltransferases  (EC  2.1.1.-)  constitute  an  important  class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy)  and  a  methylated  molecule.  The substrates that are methylated by
these  enzymes  cover  virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules,  to  lipids,  proteins  and  nucleic  acids. Methyltransferases are
therefore   involved   in   many   essential   cellular   processes  including
biosynthesis,  signal  transduction,  protein repair, chromatin regulation and
gene  silencing  [1,2,3].  More  than  230  different  enzymatic  reactions of
methyltransferases  have been described so far, of which more than 220 use SAM
as  the  methyl  donor  [E1].  A  review  published  in  2003  [2] divides all
methyltransferases  into  5  classes based on the structure of their catalytic
domain (fold):
 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta     see <PDOC51555>
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta     see <PDOC51604>
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta
A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:
 - class VI:   transmembrane			all alpha      see <PDOC51598>
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

Class  V  proteins contain the SET domain (see <PDOC50280>) usually flanked by
other  domains  forming  the  so-called pre- and post-SET regions. The enzymes
belonging  to  this class all N-methylate lysine in proteins. Most of them are
histone    methyltransferases   (EC   2.1.1.43)   like   the   histone   H3-K9
methyltransferase    dim-5    (see    <PDB:1ML9>)   or   the   histone   H3-K4
methyltransferase  SETD7  (see  <PDB:1H3I>)  [3,4].  Some others methylate the
large   subunit   of  the  enzyme  ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase
(RuBisCO)  (EC  2.1.1.127)  in  plants;  in  these  enzymes  the SET domain is
interrupted  by  a novel domain [4]. Cytochrome c lysine  N-methyltransferases
(EC 2.1.1.59)  do  not  possess a SET domain, or at least  not  a  SET  domain
detected  by any  of the detection methods; however they do display a SET-like
region and for this reason they are also assigned to this class [5].

Some enzymatic activities known to belong to the Class V superfamily:

 - SETD3 histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - TRX/MLL histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - Suvar4-20 histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - SET2 histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - PR/SET histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - Suvar3-9 histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - EZ histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - SET7 histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43).
 - RuBisCO methyltransferase: [Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase]-lysine
   N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.127).
 - [Cytochrome c]-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.59).

The profiles we developed to identify Class V SAM-dependent methyltransferases
families are directed against whole length proteins.
