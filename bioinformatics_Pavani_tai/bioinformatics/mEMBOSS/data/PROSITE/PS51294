* Myb-type HTH DNA-binding domain profiles *
********************************************

The  myb  family can be classified into three groups: the myb-type HTH domain,
which  binds  DNA,  the  SANT  domain,  which is a protein-protein interaction
module  (see  <PDOC51293>)  and  the  myb-like  domain that can be involved in
either of these functions.

The myb-type HTH domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of ~55
amino   acids,   typically   occurring   in  a  tandem  repeat  in  eukaryotic
transcription  factors.  The  domain  is  named  after the retroviral oncogene
v-myb,  and  its  cellular counterpart c-myb, which encode nuclear DNA-binding
proteins  that  specifically  recognize  the  sequence  YAAC(G/T)G  [1,2]. Myb
proteins  contain  three tandem repeats of 51 to 53 amino acids, termed R1, R2
and  R3.  This  repeat  region  is  involved in DNA-binding and R2 and R3 bind
directly  to  the  DNA  major  groove.  The  major part of the first repeat is
missing in retroviral v-Myb sequences and in plant myb-related (R2R3) proteins
[3].  A  single  myb-type HTH DNA-binding domain occurs in TRF1 and TRF2.

The  3D-structure  of  the  myb-type HTH domain forms three alpha-helices (see
<PDB:1H88; C>) [4]. The second and third helices connected via a turn comprise
the  helix-turn-helix  motif.  Helix  3  is termed the recognition helix as it
binds the DNA major groove, like in other HTHs.

Some proteins known to contain a myb-type HTH domain:

 - Fruit fly myb protein [2].
 - Vertebrate myb-like proteins A-myb and B-myb.
 - Maize  anthocyanin  regulatory  C1  protein,  a  trans-acting  factor which
   controls the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
 - Maize P protein [5], a trans-acting factor which regulates the biosynthetic
   pathway of a flavonoid-derived pigment in certain floral tissues.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana protein GL1/GLABROUS1 [6], required for the initiation
   of differentiation of leaf hair cells (trichomes).
 - Maize and barley myb-related proteins Zm1, Zm38 and Hv1, Hv33 [7].
 - Yeast BAS1 [8], a transcriptional activator for the HIS4 gene.
 - Yeast REB1 [9], which recognizes sites  within  both  the  enhancer and the
   promoter  of  rRNA  transcription,  as  well  as  upstream  of  many  genes
   transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
 - Fission  yeast  cdc5,  a  possible  transcription  factor whose activity is
   required for cell cycle progression and growth during G2.
 - Fission yeast myb1, which regulates telomere length and function.
 - Baker's yeast pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1.
 - Vertebrate telomeric repeat-binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1/2), which bind to
   telomeric DNA and are involved in telomere length regulation.

We  have  developed a profile, which has been manually adapted to specifically
detect  the  DNA-binding  myb-type  HTH  domain.  A second general profile was
developed  for  detection  of  the  myb-like domain with a high sensitivity. A
third profile was developed for the SANT domain (see <PDOC51293>).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Sequences  known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL,
 except 25.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note:  The  profiles are in competition with one another and with the profile
 of the SANT domain (see <PDOC51293>).

-Last update:  February  2007  /  Profile  and  text  revised;  profile added;
 patterns removed.
