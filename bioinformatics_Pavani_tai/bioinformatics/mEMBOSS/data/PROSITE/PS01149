* Rsu family of pseudouridine synthase signature *
**************************************************

The following  bacterial  proteins,  which  seems  to  belong  to  a family of
pseudouridine synthases  (EC 5.4.99.-) [1] have been shown to share regions of
similarities:

 - Escherichia   coli  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  16S  pseudouridylate  516
   synthase (EC  5.4.99.-)  (gene:  rsuA).  This enzyme is responsible for the
   formation of pseudouridine from uracil-516 in 16S ribosomal RNA.
 - Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae ribosomal large subunit
   pseudouridine synthase B (rluB).
 - Bacillus subtilis ribosomal large subunit pseudouridine synthase B (rluB).
 - Escherichia coli ribosomal large subunit pseudouridine synthase F (rluF).
 - Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae ribosomal large subunit
   pseudouridine synthase E (rluE).
 - Aquifex aeolicus hypothetical protein AQ_554.
 - Aquifex aeolicus hypothetical protein AQ_1464.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ytzF.
 - Borrelia burgdorferi hypothetical protein BB0129.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP1459.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0361.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0612.

These are    proteins  of from 25 to 40 Kd which contain a number of conserved
regions in their central section. They can be picked up in the database by the
following highly conserved pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-R-L-D-x(2)-[STA]-x-G-[LIVFA]-[LIVMF](3)-[ST]-[DNST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2005 / Text revised.
