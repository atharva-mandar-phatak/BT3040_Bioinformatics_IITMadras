* Aerolysin type toxins signature *
***********************************

Aerolysin [1]  is a cytolytic  toxin  exported  by the Gram-negative Aeromonas
bacteria.    The mature toxin binds to eukaryotic cells and aggregates to form
holes  (approximately 3 nm in  diameter)  leading  to the  destruction  of the
membrane permeability barrier  and osmotic lysis.   Staphylococcus aureus also
exports a cytotoxin, alpha-toxin [2], whose biological activity  is similar to
that of aerolysin.  The sequences of  both toxins are not similar except for a
stretch of ten residues rather well conserved.

-Consensus pattern: [KT]-x(2)-N-W-x(2)-T-[DN]-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin [3] has been said to contain a  region
 whose sequence is similar to that of the conserved domain of areolysin/alpha-
 toxin, but the similarity is very weak and this toxin is not picked up by the
 above pattern.

-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
