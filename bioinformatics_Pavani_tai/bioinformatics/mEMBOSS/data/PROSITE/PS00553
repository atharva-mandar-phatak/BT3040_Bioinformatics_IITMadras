* Lambdoid phages regulatory protein CIII signature *
*****************************************************

The lambdoid phage  regulatory  protein  CIII [1] is  a   very  small  protein
whose presence  in  the  cell  results  in   the   stabilization  of  the  CII
transcriptional activator, a usually very unstable protein. The stabilized CII
protein is then able to activate CI, the gene  for the repressor protein which
prevents the transcription  of  proteins necessary  for  lytic development and
thus promotes the establishment of lysogeny.

The exact mechanism of  the  action of CIII on the stability of CII is not yet
known, although it has been proposed  that  CIII  acts  as  an  inhibitor of a
protease that degrades CII.

It has been shown that a region of 22 residues, located in the central part of
various lambdoid  phage  CIII's,  is the region of highest sequence similarity
and sufficient  for   the  activity of the protein.  We have derived a pattern
from this region.

-Consensus pattern: E-S-x-L-x-R-x(2)-[KR]-x-L-x(4)-[KR](2)-x(2)-[DE]-x-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 1991 / First entry.
