* Dehydroquinase class II signature *
*************************************

3-dehydroquinate dehydratase  (EC  4.2.1.10), or dehydroquinase, catalyzes the
conversion of  3-dehydroquinate  into 3-dehydroshikimate. It is the third step
in the  shikimate  pathway  for  the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids from
chorismate. Two  classes  of dehydroquinases  exist,  known as types I and II.
Class-II enzymes are homododecameric enzymes of about 17 Kd. They are found in
some bacteria such as actinomycetales [1,2] and some fungi where they act in a
catabolic pathway  that allows the use of quinic acid as a carbon source. As a
signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in the N-terminal section.
