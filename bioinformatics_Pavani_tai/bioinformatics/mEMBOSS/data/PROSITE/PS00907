* Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase signatures *
*********************************************

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.37) (URO-D), the fifth enzyme  of the
heme biosynthetic pathway,  catalyzes the  sequential  decarboxylation  of the
four acetyl side chains of uroporphyrinogen to yield coproporphyrinogen [1].

URO-D deficiency  is  responsible  for  the  Human  genetic  diseases familial
porphyria cutanea tarda (fPCT) and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP).

The sequence of URO-D has been well conserved throughout evolution.  The  best
conserved  region is  located  in the N-terminal section; it contains a highly
conserved hexapeptide.  There  are  two  arginine residues in this hexapeptide
which could  be  involved  in  the  binding, via salt bridges, to the carboxyl
groups of the propionate side chains of the substrate. We  used this region as
a signature  pattern.  A  second  signature pattern is based on a another well
conserved region which is located in the central section of the protein.

-Consensus pattern: [SP]-[IVCLAM]-W-[LIVMFYC]-[LM]-R-[QR]-[AVS]-G-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIMF]-[GAVS]-F-[STAGCV]-[STAGC]-x-[PA]-[FWYV]-T-[LIVM]-
                    x(2)-Y-x(2,3)-[ADE]-[GK]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
