* BRO1 domain profile *
***********************

Vesicular  trafficking  pathways  sort  transmembrane proteins and lipids into
small  vesicles  that  invaginate  into the endosome. Endosomes coordinate the
transport  of  endocytic,  biosynthetic  and recycling cargoes. Multivesicular
bodies  (MVBs)  are  late  endosomes  which  contain lumenal vesicles that are
sorted  for  delivery either in the lysosome in metazoans, or into the vacuole
in  yeast  or  may  be  targeted for extracellular release. MVBs fuse with the
vacuole/lysosome  where  the  vesicles  and  their  contents  are  degraded by
hydrolases.  The  sorting  of  MVB  cargo and budding of vesicles into the MVB
lumen  require  the  endosomal  sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
complexes I, II and III. The ESCRT-III complex of yeast assembles on endosomal
membranes for the formation of a new vesicle within the MVB cargo.

The  BRO1  domain  is a ~390 residue domain, present in proteins such as yeast
BRO1  and  human  PDCD6IP/Alix  that  are involved in protein targeting to the
vacuole  or  lysosome.  The BRO1 domain of fungal and mammalian proteins binds
with  multivesicular  body  components (ESCRT-III proteins) such as yeast Snf7
and  mammalian  CHMP4b,  and  can  function  to  target BRO1 domain-containing
proteins to endosomes [1-3].

The 3D structure of the BRO1 domain has a boomerang shape composed of 14 alpha
helices   and   3  beta  sheets  (see  <PDB:1ZB1>)  and  contains  a  TPR-like
substructure (see <PDOC50005>) in the central part [1]. The C-terminus is less
conserved.

Some proteins known to contain a BRO1 domain:

 - Fungal  vacuolar protein-sorting protein BRO1 involved in concentration and
   sorting of  cargo  proteins  of the MVB for incorporation into intralumenal
   vesicles.
 - Mammalian  programmed  cell  death  6-interacting protein (PDCD6IP), a BRO1
   homolog. Human PDCD6IP is also required for HIV budding.
 - Mammalian  tyrosine-protein  phosphatase  non-receptor  type  23  (PTPN23).
 - Vertebrate rhophilin, a GTP-Rho binding protein.
 - Fungal  pH-response  regulator  proteins  RIM20/palA  and  palC,  which are
   required  for the proteolytic activation of the transcription factor RIM101
   in response to alkaline ambient pH [3].
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans  apoptosis-linked  gene  2-interacting protein X 1
   (alx-1),  a  BRO1 homolog, involved in post-internalization trafficking and
   degradation.

The  profile  we developed covers the entire BRO1 domain and has been manually
adapted to detect the less conserved C-terminal parts.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
