* PCMH-type FAD-binding domain profile *
****************************************

Flavoenzymes  have  the  ability  to  catalyse  a  wide  range  of biochemical
reactions.   They  are  involved  in  the  dehydrogenation  of  a  variety  of
metabolites,  in  electron  transfer  from  and  to  redox  centres,  in light
emission,  in  the  activation  of  oxygen  for  oxidation  and  hydroxylation
reactions  [1,2].  About  1%  of  all  eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are
predicted  to  encode  a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain [3].
According   to   structural   similarities   and  conserved  sequence  motifs,
FAD-binding  domains  have  been  grouped  in  three  main  families:  (i) the
ferredoxin  reductase (FR)-type FAD-binding domain (see <PDOC51384>), (ii) the
FAD-binding  domains  that  adopt  a  Rossmann  fold  and  (iii)  the p-cresol
methylhydroxylase (PCMH)-type FAD-binding domain [4].

The  FAD  cofactor  consists of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) linked to flavin
mononucleotide  (FMN)  by  a pyrophosphate bond. The AMP moiety is composed of
the  adenine  ring bonded to a ribose that is linked to a phosphate group. The
FMN  moiety  is composed of the isoalloxazine-flavin ring linked to a ribitol,
which  is  connected  to  a  phosphate group. The flavin functions mainly in a
redox  capacity,  being  able  to take up two electrons from one substrate and
release  them two at a time to a substrate or coenzyme, or one at a time to an
electron  acceptor.  The  catalytic function of the FAD is concentrated in the
isoalloxazine  ring,  whereas  the ribityl phosphate and the AMP moiety mainly
stabilize cofactor binding to protein residues [1,2].

The PCMH-type FAD-binding domain consists of two alpha-beta subdomains: one is
composed  of  three parallel beta-strands (B1-B3) surrounded by alpha-helices,
and  is  packed  against  the  second  subdomain  containing five antiparallel
beta-strands (B4-B8) surrounded by alpha-helices (see <PDB:1DII>) [5]. The two
subdomains  accomodate the FAD cofactor between them [2]. In the PCMH proteins
the coenzyme FAD is also covalently attached to a tyrosine located outside the
FAD-binding domain in the C-terminal catalytic domain [6].

Some proteins containing a PCMH-type FAD-binding domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial  UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase (EC 1.1.1.158). It
   is involved in the cell wall formation.
 - Vertebrate alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.26).
 - Eukaryotic lactate dehydrogenase D (EC 1.1.2.4).
 - Bacterial  carbon  monoxide  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.99.2). It catalyzes the
   oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.

The profile we developed covers the whole PCMH-type FAD-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
