****************************
* Reticulon domain profile *
****************************

Eukaryotic proteins  of  the  reticulon  (RTN) family all share an association
with the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER). Whereas amino-terminal regions are not
related to  one another, all reticulon proteins share a 200-amino-acid residue
region of  sequence  similarity  at  the  C-terminus. This region contains two
large hydrophobic  regions  separated by a 66-residue hydrophilic segment. The
conserved hydrophobic  C-terminal  portion has been shown to play an essential
role in  the  association  of reticulons with the ER membrane. The hydrophobic
portions are  supposed  to be membrane-embedded and the hydrophilic 66-residue
localized to  the  lumenal/extracellular face of the membrane. Most reticulons
have a di-lysine ER retention motif at the C-terminus. Because of their likely
association with the rough as well as the smooth ER, the reticulons might play
some role  in  transport  processes  or in regulation of intracellular calcium
levels. It  has  been  suggested  that  the  reticulons  may be serving as ER-
associated channel-like complexes [1,2,3,4,5].

The profile  we  developed  covers  the  entire conserved C-terminal reticulon
domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
