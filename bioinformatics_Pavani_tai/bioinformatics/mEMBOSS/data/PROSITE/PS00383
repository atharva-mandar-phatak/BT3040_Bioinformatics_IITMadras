* Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases signature and profiles *
*****************************************************************

Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases  (EC 3.1.3.48)  (PTPase) [1 to 5]   are
enzymes  that catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a tyrosine
residue.  These  enzymes  are  very  important in  the control of cell growth,
proliferation, differentiation and transformation.   Multiple  forms of PTPase
have been characterized  and   can be  classified into two categories: soluble
PTPases and transmembrane receptor proteins that contain PTPase domain(s). The
currently known PTPases are listed below:

Soluble PTPases.

 - PTPN1 (PTP-1B).
 - PTPN2 (T-cell PTPase; TC-PTP).
 - PTPN3  (H1) and PTPN4 (MEG), enzymes that contain an N-terminal FERM domain
   (see <PDOC00566>)  and  could  act  at  junctions  between the membrane and
   cytoskeleton.
 - PTPN5 (STEP).
 - PTPN6  (PTP-1C;  HCP; SHP) and PTPN11 (PTP-2C; SH-PTP3; Syp), enzymes which
   contain two  copies  of  the  SH2  domain  at its N-terminal extremity. The
   Drosophila protein corkscrew (gene csw) also belongs to this subgroup.
 - PTPN7 (LC-PTP; Hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase; HePTP).
 - PTPN8 (70Z-PEP).
 - PTPN9 (MEG2).
 - PTPN12 (PTP-G1; PTP-P19).

 - Yeast PTP1.
 - Yeast PTP2  which  may  be  involved    in  the  ubiquitin-mediated protein
   degradation pathway.
 - Fission  yeast  pyp1  and pyp2 which play a role in inhibiting the onset of
   mitosis.
 - Fission yeast pyp3 which contributes to the dephosphorylation of cdc2.
 - Yeast CDC14 which may be involved in chromosome segregation.
 - Yersinia virulence plasmid PTPAses (gene yopH).
 - Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus 19 Kd PTPase.

Dual specificity PTPases.

 - DUSP1 (PTPN10; MAP kinase phosphatase-1; MKP-1); which dephosphorylates MAP
   kinase on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185.
 - DUSP2 (PAC-1), a nuclear enzyme that dephosphorylates  MAP kinases ERK1 and
   ERK2 on both Thr and Tyr residues.
 - DUSP3 (VHR).
 - DUSP4 (HVH2).
 - DUSP5 (HVH3).
 - DUSP6 (Pyst1; MKP-3).
 - DUSP7 (Pyst2; MKP-X).
 - Yeast MSG5, a PTPase that dephosphorylates MAP kinase FUS3.
 - Yeast YVH1.
 - Vaccinia virus H1 PTPase; a dual specificity phosphatase.

Receptor PTPases.

Structurally, all known receptor PTPases, are  made  up  of  a variable length
extracellular domain,  followed    by a  transmembrane region and a C-terminal
catalytic cytoplasmic domain. Some of the receptor PTPases contain fibronectin
type III   (FN-III)  repeats,  immunoglobulin-like  domains,  MAM  domains  or
carbonic anhydrase-like domains in their extracellular region. The cytoplasmic
region generally  contains two copies of the PTPAse domain. The first seems to
have enzymatic    activity,  while  the second is inactive but seems to affect
substrate specificity  of  the first. In these domains, the catalytic cysteine
is generally conserved but some other, presumably important, residues are not.

In the  following  table,  the  domain  structure of known receptor PTPases is
shown:

PTPase  domains  consist  of about 300  amino  acids.  There are two conserved
cysteines, the  second  one  has  been  shown  to  be  absolutely required for
activity. Furthermore,  a  number  of  conserved  residues  in  its  immediate
vicinity have also been shown to be important.

We derived  a signature pattern for PTPase domains centered on the active site
cysteine.

There are  three profiles for PTPases, the first one spans a short region that
is common  to  both  dual-specificity  protein  phosphatases  and PTPases. The
second and third ones cover the whole domain and are respectively specific for
Ser/Thr and Tyr protein phosphatases and Tyr protein phosphatases.

-Note: The M-phase inducer phosphatases (cdc25-type phosphatase) are tyrosine-
