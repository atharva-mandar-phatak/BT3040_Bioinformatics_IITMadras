* RWP-RK domain profile *
*************************

The RWP-RK  putative DNA-binding domain has been named after its most striking
feature, the  invariant  R-W-P-x-R-K  motif.  It  could  be  involved  in  the
regulation of  genes controlled by nitrogen status. The RWP-RK domain is found
in the following protein [1]:

 - Legume  NIN (for nodule inception), a protein required for the formation of
   infection threads and the initiation of primordia.
 - Arabidopsis  NIN-like  protein  1  (NLP1 or F6P23.15), a protein of unknown
   function.
 - Arabidopsis  NIN-like  protein 2 (NLP2 or F23E12.170), a protein of unknown
   function.
 - Arabidopsis  NIN-like  protein  7  (NLP7 or T19F6.16), a protein of unknown
   function.
 - Arabidopsis  NIN-like  protein  8  (NLP8 or T1O24.24), a protein of unknown
   function.
 - Chlamydomonas  Mid,  a  protein  that  determines  the development of minus
   gametes during  gametogenesis. It controls the expression of minus-specific
   genes and repress the expression of the opposing plus-specific genes.

The profile we developed covers the entire RWP-RK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2011 / First entry.
