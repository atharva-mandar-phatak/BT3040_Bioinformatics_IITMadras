* WLM domain profile *
**********************

The WLM  (WSS1-like  metalloprotease)  domain  is a globular domain related to
the zincin-like  superfamily  of  Zn-dependent peptidase. Since the WLM domain
contains all  known  active  site residues of zincins, it is predicted to be a
catalytically active  peptidase domain. The WLM domain is an eukaryotic domain
represented in  plants, fungi, Plasmodium, and kinetoplastids. By contrast, it
is absent  in animals, Cryptosporidium, and  Microsporidia, suggesting that it
has been  lost  on  multiple occasions during the evolution of eukaryotes. The
WLM domain  is  found  either in stand-alone form or in association with other
domains such  as  the  RanBP2  zinc  finger  (see  <PDOC50199>), the ubiquitin
domain (see  <PDOC00271>) or the PUB/PUG domain. The WLM domain could function
as a  specific  de-SUMOylating  domain  of  distinct  protein complexes in the
nucleus and the cytoplasm [1].

The WLM  domain  has  been suggested to have a segregated alpha/beta structure
with eight helices and five strands [1].

Some proteins known to contain a WLM domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  WSS1  (Weak  suppressor  of  Smt3p-1),  a weak suppressor of the Ub-
   related protein SMT3.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana putative uncharacterized protein At1g55915.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana protein with similarity to zinc metalloproteinase.
 - Schizosaccharomyces    pombe   ubiquitin/metalloprotease   fusion   protein
   SPCC1442.07c.
 - Trypanosoma brucei ORF556.

The profile we developed covers the entire WLM domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
