* LNR (Lin-12/Notch) repeat profile *
*************************************

The  Lin-12/Notch  proteins  act  as transmembrane receptors for intercellular
signals  that  specify  cell  fates  during animal development. In response to
ligand, proteolytic cleavages release the intracellular domain of Notch, which
then  gains  access  to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional co-activator
[1].  The  Lin-12/Notch repeat (LNR) is a region present only in Notch related
proteins.  The  LNR  is  supposed  to  negatively  regulates  the Lin-12/Notch
proteins activity, and participates in maintaining the receptor in its resting
conformation  prior  to ligand binding. It is a triplication of an about 35-40
amino  acid  module  present  on the extracellular part of the protein [2, 3].
Each  module  contains  six cysteine residues engaged in three disulfide bonds
and  three  conserved  aspartate  and asparagine residues [1]. The biochemical
characterization  of  a recombinantly expressed LIN-12.1 module from the human
Notch1  receptor  indicates  that  the  disulfide bonds are formed between the
first  and  fifth,  second  and fourth, and third and sixth cysteines (see the
schematic representation below).

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

The  formation  of this particular disulfide isomer is favored by the presence
of  Ca++,  which  is also required to maintain the structural integrity of the
rLIN-12.1  module.  The  structure  of  a  human LNR  has  been  solved by NMR
(see  <PDB:1PB5>). It shows that the LNR is composed of two alpha-helices [4].
The  conserved  aspartate  and  asparagine  residues  are  important  for Ca++
binding, and thereby contribute to the native fold [1,4].

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the LNR domain from the first to the last
conserved cysteine.
