* Cadherin domain signature and profile *
*****************************************

Cadherins [1,2] are a family of animal glycoproteins responsible for  calcium-
dependent  cell-cell   adhesion.    Cadherins  preferentially   interact  with
themselves in  a  homophilic  manner  in connecting cells; thus acting as both
receptor and  ligand.  A wide number of tissue-specific forms of cadherins are
known, for example:

 - Epithelial (E-cadherin) (CDH1).
 - Neural (N-cadherin) (CDH2).
 - Placental (P-cadherin) (CDH3).
 - Retinal (R-cadherin) (CDH4).
 - Vascular endothelial (VE-cadherin) (CDH5).
 - Kidney (K-cadherin) (CDH6).
 - Cadherin-8 (CDH8).
 - Cadherin-9 (CDH9).
 - Osteoblast (OB-cadherin) (CDH11).
 - Brain (BR-cadherin) (CDH12).
 - T-cadherin (truncated cadherin) (CDH13).
 - Muscle (M-cadherin) (CDH15).
 - Kidney (Ksp-cadherin) (CDH16).
 - Liver-intestine (LI-cadherin) (CDH17).

Structurally, cadherins are built of the following domains: a signal sequence,
followed by a propeptide  of about 130 residues,  then an extracellular domain
of around 600 residues, then a transmembrane region,  and finally a C-terminal
cytoplasmic domain of about 150 residues. The extracellular domain can be sub-
divided into five parts: there are four repeats of about 110 residues followed
by a region that contains four conserved cysteines.   It is suggested that the
calcium-binding region of cadherins is located in the extracellular repeats.

Cadherins are  evolutionary  related to the desmogleins which are component of
intercellular desmosome  junctions  involved  in  the  interaction  of  plaque
proteins:

 - Desmoglein 1 (desmosomal glycoprotein I).
 - Desmoglein 2.
 - Desmoglein 3 (Pemphigus vulgaris antigen).

Other proteins that include cadherin domains are:

 - Drosophila  fat  protein  [3], a huge protein of over 5000 amino acids that
   contains 34  cadherin-like repeats in its extracellular domain. Homologs of
   fat are found in mammals.
 - Protocadherins (6 copies).
 - Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ret (1 copy).

The signature pattern we have developed for the  repeated domain is located in
it the  C-terminal extremity which is its best conserved region.  The  pattern
includes two  conserved    aspartic  acid residues as well as two asparagines;
these residues  could  be  implicated  in the binding of calcium. We have also
developed a profile that spans the complete domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-x-[LIV]-x-D-x-N-D-[NH]-x-P
                    [The 2 D's and the N are involved in calcium binding]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Note: This pattern is found  in the first,  second, and fourth  copies of the
 repeated domain.   In the third copy there is a deletion of one residue after
 the second conserved Asp.
