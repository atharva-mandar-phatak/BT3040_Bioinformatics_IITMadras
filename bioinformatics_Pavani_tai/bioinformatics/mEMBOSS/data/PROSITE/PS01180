**********************
* CUB domain profile *
**********************

The CUB  domain  [1,2,E1]  is  an  extracellular  domain  of approximately 110
residues which  is  found  in  functionally  diverse,  mostly  developmentally
regulated proteins.  Almost  all  CUB domains contain four conserved cysteines
which probably form two disulfide bridges (C1-C2, C3-C4). The structure of the
CUB domain  has  been  predicted  to  be  a  beta-barrel  similar  to  that of
immunoglobulins.

Proteins that have been found to contain the CUB domain are listed below.

 - Mammalian  complement  subcomponents  C1s/C1r.  C1q,  C1s  and C1r form the
   calcium-dependent complex C1, which is the first component of the classical
   pathway  of the  complement system.  Both proteins contain two CUB domains,
   an EGF-like domain, two CCP domains and a trypsin  family  serine  protease
   domain (see <PDOC00124>).
 - Hamster  serine protease  Casp. Casp is a heterodimer of a regulatory and a
   catalytic chain  which  degrades  type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in
   the presence  of  calcium.  It shows the same modular architecture than C1s
   and C1r.
 - Mammalian  complement-activating  component  of  Ra-reactive factor (RARF).
   This protein,  also  known  as  P100,  is  a  protease  that cleaves the C4
   component of  complement.  It  shows the same modular architecture than C1s
   and C1r.
 - Vertebrate    enteropeptidase  (EC 3.4.21.9), a type II membrane protein of
   the intestinal  brush  border,  which activates trypsinogen. It consists at
   least of  a catalytic light chain  and a multidomain  heavy chain which has
   2 LDL receptor-like domains, a MAM  domain (see <PDOC00604>), a SRCR domain
   (see <PDOC00348>) and a CUB domain.
 - Vertebrate  bone  morphogenic  protein  1  (BMP-1), a protein which induces
   cartilage and  bone  formation  and  which  expresses  metalloendopeptidase
   activity. The  Drosophila homolog of BMP-1 is the dorsal-ventral patterning
   protein Tolloid, which is required for normal dorsal development. In purple
   sea urchin a homolog protein is called SuBMP. All these molecules possess a
   zinc-metalloprotease domain  (see  <PDOC00129>) and a varying number of CUB
   (up to 5 in mouse BMP-1 and Tolloid) and EGF-like domains.
 - Sea    urchins  blastula  proteins  BP10 and SpAN. Both proteins consist of
   2 CUB domains, an EGF-like domain and a zinc-metalloprotease domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  proteins  F42A10.8  and R151.5. Both
   proteins consist   of   a  CUB  domain,  a  EGF-like  domain  and  a  zinc-
   metalloprotease domain.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2 CUB domains,  2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>) and a MAM domain
   (see <PDOC00604>).
 - Fibropellins  I  and  III  from  sea urchin. These proteins form the apical
   lamina, a component of the extracellular matrix. These two proteins contain
   a CUB  domain,  followed  by a variable number of EGF-like domains and a C-
   terminal avidin-like domain (see <PDOC00499>).
 - Mammalian  hyaluronate-binding  protein  TSG-6 (or PS4), a serum and growth
   factor induced  protein  possibly  involved  in  cell-cell  and cell-matrix
   interactions during  inflammation and tumorgenesis. TSG-6 contains a 'link'
   domain followed by a CUB domain.
 - Mammalian spermadhesins (see <PDOC00758>) which consist of a CUB domain.
 - Xenopus  embryonic  protein UVS.2,  which is expressed during dorsoanterior
   development. It contains 2 CUB domains.

For the sensitive  detection of CUB domains, we have developed a profile which
spans the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
