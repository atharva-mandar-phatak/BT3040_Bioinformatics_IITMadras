* Pestivirus NS3 proteaase (NS3pro) domain profile *
****************************************************

The genome  of  pestiviruses  [E1]  is a single plus-strand RNA and contains a
single large  open reading frame (ORF), a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and a
3' untranslated  region  (3'UTR).  The  ORF  encodes  a  polyprotein, which is
processed by viral and cellular proteases into mature proteins (the structural
proteins in  the  N-terminal portion of the polyprotein whilst the replicative
(non-structural or  NS) proteins constitute the remainder). The pestivirus NS3
protein is  a multifunctional protein possessing serine protease, RNA helicase
(see <PDOC51192>),   and   a  nucleoside  triphosphatase  (NTPase)  activities
located in  two  functionally  distinct  domains.  The N-terminal one-third of
pestiviral NS3   primarily   serves   as  a  protease  to  process  the  viral
polyprotein. The  helicase  and  NTPase  activities  are  localized  to the C-
terminal of  NS3  protein.  The NS3 protease (NS3pro) domain is of some 180 aa
with a  catalytic  triad  of  His-Asp-Ser. Positive regulation (activation) is
observed by  its  interaction  with  NS4A.  The pestivirus NS3pro domain forms
peptidase family S31 of clan PA [E2].

The profile we developed covers the entire pestivirus NS3pro domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2011 / First entry.
