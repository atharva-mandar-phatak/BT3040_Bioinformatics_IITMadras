* Arterivirus nsp2 cysteine protease (AV CP) domain profile *
*************************************************************

Arteriviruses are   enveloped,   positive-stranded  RNA  viruses  and  include
pathogens of   major   economic  concern  to  the  swine-  and  horse-breeding
industries [E1]:

  - Equine arteritis virus (EAV).
  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).
  - Mice actate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.
  - Simian hemorrhagic fever virus.

The arterivirus  cysteine  protease  (AV  CP)  is the most carboxyl-terminally
located member  of  the  array of three cysteine proteinase domains present in
the amino-terminal  500  residues  of the replicase polyproteins. The AV CP is
located in  the  amino-terminal  region  of nsp2 and is highly conserved among
arteriviruses. The  cleavage  of  the nsp2|3 junction appears to be the single
processing step mediated by the AV CP. For EAV, it has been shown that cleaved
nsp2 is  an  essential  co-factor  for cleavage of the nsp4|6 site by the nsp4
proteinase domain (see <PDOC51493>). The AV CP is an unusual Cys protease with
amino acid  sequence  similarities  to  both papain-like and chymotrypsin-like
proteases. The catalytic dyad is composed of Cys and His residues [1,2,3]. The
AV CP domain forms peptidase family C33 [E2].

Comparative sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis have characterized
the AV CP as a cysteine endopeptidase whose conserved domain encompasses about
100 residues. The entire AV CP domain is highly conserved among arteriviruses.
Among the  conserved  residues  are  a  number  of cysteines and one aspartate
residues [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire AV CP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
