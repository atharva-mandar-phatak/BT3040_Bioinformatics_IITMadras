* Leucine rich repeat profile *
*******************************

The  leucine-rich  repeat  (LRR)  domain is formed from tandem arrays (2 to 52
repeats)  containing a leucine-rich consensus sequence. LRR proteins have been
identified  in  viruses,  bacteria, archae and eukaryotes. LRR domains mediate
macromolecular  interactions  in processes as diverse as bacterial invasion of
host  cells, the plant immune response, and inhibition of RNA binding. All LRR
repeats can be divided into a highly conserved segment and a variable segment.
The  highly  conserved  segment  consists  either  of  an  11-residue stretch,
LxxLxLxxNxL,   or  a  12-residue  stretch,  LxxLxLxxCxxL.  Variable  sequences
connecting the consensus provide functional diversity for binding [1,2].

Various  crystallographic  studies  of leucine-rich repeats revealed that each
LRR  contains  a  beta-strand  and  an alpha-helix connected by loops (see for
example  <PDB:2BNH>)  [3].  Multiple  LRRs  are  arranged  so that they form a
nonglobular, horseshoe-shaped structure, wherein parallel beta-sheets line the
inner  circumference  of  the  horseshoe  (the concave side) and alpha-helices
decorate the outer circumference (the convex side). Although the sequences and
numbers  of  LRRs can differ, diverse LRRs share this overall horseshoe shape.
Mutagenesis  studies  and  structural  analyses  of  LRR-ligand complexes have
revealed that the concave surface of LRRs is involved mainly in ligand binding
[2].

In  various  types  of  repeats  it  has been shown that they fold in a highly
cooperative   manner.   In   general   folding  of  an  individual  repeat  is
energetically  unfavorable,  whereas  formation  of  interrepeat interfaces is
highly  favorable.  Thus,  folding is initiated only when two adjacent repeats
fold  forming  a  favorable  interface. Once this activation energy barrier is
surpassed,  folding  proceeds rapidly, via a nucleation-propagation mechanism.
In  some  LRR  repeats  it  has  been  show  that  nucleation  initiate in the
N-terminal  capping  domain [4,5].

The  profile we developed covers the 22 amino acids of the LRR repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: sea  lampreys  have  evolved a primitive immune system based on the LRR
 domain  scaffold.  The  LRR  is   used  instead  of the Ig domain to generate
 diversity [6].
