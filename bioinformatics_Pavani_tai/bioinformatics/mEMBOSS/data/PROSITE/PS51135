* CIDE-N domain profile *
*************************

The  CIDE-N  or  CAD  domain  is  a ~78 amino acid protein-protein interaction
domain  in  the  N-terminal  part  of  Cell death-Inducing DFF45-like Effector
(CIDE)  proteins, involved in apoptosis. At the final stage of programmed cell
death,  chromosomal  DNA is degraded into fragments by Caspase-activated DNase
(CAD),  also  named  DNA  fragmentation factor 40 kDa (DFF40). In normal cells
CAD/DFF40  is completely inhibited by its binding to DFF45 or Inhibitor of CAD
(ICAD).   Apoptotic  stimuli  provoke  cleavage  of  ICAD/DFF45  by  caspases,
resulting  in  self-assembly  of  CAD/DFF40  into  the  active dimer [1].

Both  CAD/DFF40  and  ICAD/DFF45  possess  an N-terminal CIDE-N domain that is
involved  in  their  interaction.  The name of the CIDE-N domain refers to the
CIDE  proteins  and CAD, where the domain forms the N-terminal part [2,3]. The
CIDE-N domains from different proteins can interact, e.g. CIDE-N of CIDE-B and
ICAD/DFF45  with CIDE-N of CAD/DFF40, and such interactions can also be needed
for proper folding [4,5].

Tertiary  structures show that the CIDE-N domain forms an alpha/beta roll fold
of five beta-strands forming a single, mixed parallel/anti-parallel beta-sheet
with  one  [4]  or  two  [3,5]  alpha-helices  packed  against  the sheet (see
<PDB:1IBX>).  Binding surfaces of the CIDE-N domain form a central hydrophobic
cluster, while specific binding interfaces can be formed by charged patches.

Some proteins known to contain a CIDE-N domain:

 - Mammalian  DNA  fragmentation  factor  40  kDa (DFF40) or Caspase-activated
   deoxyribonuclease (CAD), an endonuclease that induces DNA fragmentation and
   chromatin condensation during apoptosis. The degradation of chromosomal DNA
   by  CAD/DFF40 will kill the cells.
 - Mammalian  DNA  fragmentation  factor  45  kDa  (DFF45) or Inhibitor of CAD
   (ICAD), which controls the activity and proper folding of CAD/DFF40.
 - Mammalian CIDE-A and CIDE-B, activators of cell death and DNA fragmentation
   that  can  be  inhibited  by ICAD/DFF45. In contrast with CAD and ICAD, the
   CIDE  proteins are expressed in a highly restricted way and show pronounced
   tissue specificity.
 - Fruit  fly  DNAation  factor  DREP1,  a  DFF45  homolog  that  can  inhibit
   CIDE-A-induced apoptosis.

The profile we developed covers the entire CIDE-N domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
