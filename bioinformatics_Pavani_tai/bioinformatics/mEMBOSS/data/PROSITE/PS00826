****************************
* MARCKS family signatures *
****************************

The myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) [1] is a protein of
about 300  amino  acid  residues  .  It  is one of the most prominent cellular
substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). The N-terminal glycine residue of MARCKS
is myristoylated  and  allows the protein  to associate with plasma membranes.
MARCKS binds calmodulin in a  calcium-dependent manner;  the  region of MARCKS
responsible for  calcium-binding    is a highly basic domain of 25 amino acids
(called PSD)  that  contains  the  PKC  phosphorylation  sites. When it is not
phosphorylated, the PSD domain can bind to filamentous actin.

A protein  known  as  MRP (MARCKS-related protein), MacMARKCS or F52 is highly
similar  to MARCKS both  in  its  properties (myristoylation, phosphorylation,
calmodulin-binding) and at the level of the sequence.

We have selected two signature patterns  for this family of protein. The first
is a  perfectly  conserved  heptapeptide  located  in  the  N-terminal part of
MARCKS and  MRP  and    also  found  in  the cytoplasmic region of the cation-
independent mannose-6-phosphate    receptor.  The function  of  this conserved
region is not yet known. The second pattern corresponds to the PSD domain.
