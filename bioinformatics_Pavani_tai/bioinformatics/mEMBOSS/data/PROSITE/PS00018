* EF-hand calcium-binding domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

Many calcium-binding proteins belong to the same evolutionary family and share
a  type  of calcium-binding domain known as the EF-hand [1 to 5]. This type of
domain  consists  of  a  twelve  residue loop flanked on both side by a twelve
residue  alpha-helical domain (see <PDB:1CLL>). In an EF-hand loop the calcium
ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The six residues
involved  in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12; these residues
are denoted by X, Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12
provides   two   oxygens  for  liganding  Ca  (bidentate  ligand).  The  basic
structural/functional  unit  of  EF-hand proteins is usually a pair of EF-hand
motifs  that  together  form a stable four-helix bundle domain. The pairing of
EF-hand enables cooperativity in the binding of Ca2+ ions.

We list below the proteins  which  are  known to contain EF-hand  regions. For
each type of protein we have indicated between parenthesis the total number of
EF-hand regions known or supposed to exist.   This  number  does  not  include
regions which  clearly  have  lost  their  calcium-binding  properties, or the
atypical low-affinity site (which spans thirteen residues) found in the S-100/
ICaBP family of proteins [6].

There has been a number of attempts [7,8] to develop patterns that pick-up EF-
hand  regions,  but  these  studies were made a few years ago when not so many
different  families  of  calcium-binding  proteins  were  known.  We therefore
developed a new pattern which takes into account all published sequences. This
pattern  includes the complete EF-hand loop as well as the first residue which
follows  the loop and which seem to always be hydrophobic. We also developed a
profile that covers the loop and the two alpha helices.

-Consensus pattern: D-{W}-[DNS]-{ILVFYW}-[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]-{GP}-[LIVMC]-
                    [DENQSTAGC]-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVMFYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
 for a few sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
 probably not calcium-binding  and  a few proteins for which we have reason to
 believe that  they bind  calcium:  a number  of endoglucanases and a xylanase
 from the  cellulosome complex of Clostridium [9].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Positions 1 (X), 3 (Y) and 12 (-Z) are the most conserved.
-Note: The 6th residue in an EF-hand loop is, in most  cases a  Gly,  but  the
 number of exceptions to this 'rule' has gradually increased and we felt  that
 the pattern should include all the  different  residues which have been shown
 to exist in this position in functional Ca-binding sites.
-Note: The pattern will, in some cases,  miss  one  of  the EF-hand regions in
 some proteins with multiple EF-hand domains.
