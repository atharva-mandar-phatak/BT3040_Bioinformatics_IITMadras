* Zinc finger A20-type profile *
********************************

NF-kappaB  transcription  factors  mediate  the  effects  of  pro-inflammatory
cytokines  such  as  TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 beta. Failure to downregulate
NF-kappaB  transcriptional  activity  results in chronic inflammation and cell
death  [1].  It  has  been  shown that A20 protein can downregulates NF-kappaB
signaling  by  targeting  receptor  interacting  protein  (RIP),  an essential
mediator  of  the  proximal  TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling complex, to the
proteasome [2].

The C-terminal  region of A20, is composed of seven C4-type zinc fingers, that
function  as a  ubiquitin  ligase by polyubiquitinating RIP with Lys-48-linked
ubiquitin chains, thereby targeting RIP for proteasomal degradation [2].

A20-type  zinc  fingers  are  found  in all eukaryotes and form fusions with a
variety of domains involved in ubiquitin signaling pathways.

The profile we developed covers the whole A20-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
