* Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain profile *
********************************************

The forkhead-associated  (FHA) domain [1,E1] is  a putative nuclear signalling
domain found  in  a  variety  of  otherwise unrelated proteins. The FHA domain
comprise approximately  55  to  75  amino  acids  and  contains  three  highly
conserved blocks separated by divergent spacer regions. Currently  it has been
found in the following proteins:

 - Four  transcription factors that also contain a forkhead (FH) domain: mouse
   myocyte nuclear  factor  1  (MNF1),  yeast transcription factor FHL1, which
   probably controls  pre-mRNA  processing, and  yeast FKH1 and FKH2. In those
   protein the FHA domain is located N-terminal of the DNA-binding FH domain.
 - Kinase-associated protein  phosphatase  (KAPP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, a
   protein which specifically interacts with the receptor-type  Ser/Thr-kinase
   RLK5. In  KAPP,  the  FHA domain  maps  to a region that interacts with the
   receptor-type protein  kinase  RLK5 only if the kinase is phosphorylated on
   serine residues [2].
 - Two  protein  kinases from yeast that are involved in mediating the nuclear
   response to  DNA  damage:  DUN1  and  SPK1/SAD1 [3]. The latter is the only
   known protein containing two copies of the FHA domain.
 - Protein  kinase  cds1 from fission yeast contains a FHA domain and might be
   the ortholog of SPK1.
 - Protein kinase MEK1 from yeast, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Human nuclear antigen Ki67 which is expressed only in proliferating cells.

 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR115c, which contains a RING-finger C-terminal
   of the FHA domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins L8083.1 and 9346.10, which contain an extensive
   coiled-coil region C-terminal of the FHA domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK632.2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C01G6.5.

 - FraH  from  the  prokaryote Anabaena, which contains a zinc-finger motif N-
   terminal of the FHA domain.
 - An  ORF from the bacterium Streptomyces, which is on the opposite strand of
   the protein kinase pks1, overlapping the ORF of the kinase.

The profile we developed for the FHA domain covers the total domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
