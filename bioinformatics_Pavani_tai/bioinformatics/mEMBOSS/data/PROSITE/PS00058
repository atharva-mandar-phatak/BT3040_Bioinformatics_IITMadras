* DNA mismatch repair proteins mutL / hexB / PMS1 signature *
*************************************************************

Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication [1]. It
involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that  have been missed by the
proofreading  element  of the DNA polymerase complex.     The sequence of some
proteins involved in mismatch repair in different organisms have been found to
be evolutionary related. These proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli and  Salmonella typhimurium  mutL  protein [2].   MutL  is
   required for dam-dependent methyl-directed DNA repair.
 - Streptococcus pneumoniae hexB protein [3]. The Hex system is nick directed.
 - Yeast proteins PMS1 and MLH1 [4].
 - Human protein MLH1 [5] which is  involved  in a form of familial hereditary
   nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).

As a signature pattern for  this class of mismatch repair proteins we selected
a  perfectly conserved heptapeptide which is located in the N-terminal section
of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: G-F-R-G-E-[AG]-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
