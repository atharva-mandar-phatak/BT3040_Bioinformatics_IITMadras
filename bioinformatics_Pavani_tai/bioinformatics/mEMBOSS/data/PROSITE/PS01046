* ATP-dependent serine proteases, lon family, serine active site *
******************************************************************

The following proteins belongs to a family of proteases which are dependent on
the hydrolysis  of  ATP  for  their  activity and which have a serine in their
active site:

 - Bacterial  ATP-dependent  proteases [1,2]. The prototype of those bacterial
   enzymes is  the  Escherichia coli La protease (EC 3.4.21.53) (gene lon). La
   is capable   of   hydrolyzing   large  proteins;  it  degrades  short-lived
   regulatory (such  as  rcsA  and  sulA)  and  abnormal  proteins.  It  is  a
   cytoplasmic protein  of  87  Kd  that  associates  as  an homotetramer. Its
   proteolytic activity is stimulated by single-stranded DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  mitochondrial  matrix  proteases [3,4].  The prototype of these
   enzymes is the yeast PIM1 protease. It is a mitochondrial matrix protein of
   120 Kd  that associated as an homohexamer. It catalyzes the initial step of
   mitochondrial protein degradation.
 - Haemophilus influenzae lon-B (HI1324), a protein which does not contain the
   ATP-binding domain,  but possess a slightly divergent form of the catalytic
   domain.

The region  around  the serine residue involved in the catalytic mechanism [5]
is perfectly conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: D-G-[PD]-S-A-[GS]-[LIVMCA]-[TA]-[LIVM]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Proteins belonging to this family  also contain a copy  of the ATP/GTP-
 binding motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).
-Note: These proteins belong to family S16 in the classification of peptidases
 [6,E1].
