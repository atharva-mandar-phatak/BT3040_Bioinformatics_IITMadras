* Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

The  vitamin  K-dependent  blood  coagulation  factor  IX  as  well as several
extracellular  regulatory proteins require vitamin K for the posttranslational
synthesis  of  gamma-carboxyglutamic  acid,  an  amino  acid  clustered in the
N-terminal  Gla  domain  of these proteins [1,2]. The Gla domain is a membrane
binding  motif  which,  in  the  presence  of  calcium  ions,  interacts  with
phospholipid membranes that include phosphatidylserine.

The  3D  structure  of  the  Gla  domain  has  been  solved  (see  for example
<PDB:1CFH>)  [3,4].  Calcium  ions  induce  conformational  changes in the Gla
domain  and  are  necessary  for  the  Gla  domain  to fold properly. A common
structural  feature  of functional Gla domains is the clustering of N-terminal
hydrophobic  residues  into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with
the cell surface membrane [4].

Proteins known to contain a Gla domain are listed below:

 - A number of plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation.   These proteins
   are prothrombin, coagulation factors VII, IX and X, proteins C, S, and Z.
 - Two proteins that  occur  in calcified tissues:  osteocalcin (also known as
   bone-Gla protein, BGP), and matrix Gla-protein (MGP).
 - Proline-rich Gla proteins 1 and 2 [5].
 - Cone snail venom peptides: conantokin-G and -T, and conotoxin GS [6].

The  pattern  we  developed  start with the conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x-Cys motif
found  in  the  middle of the domain which seems to be important for substrate
recognition by the carboxylase [7] and end with the last conserved position of
the  domain (an aromatic residue). We also developed a profile that covers the
whole Gla domain.

-Consensus pattern: E-x(2)-[ERK]-E-x-C-x(6)-[EDR]-x(10,11)-[FYA]-[YW]
                    [The 2 E's are the carboxylation site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: All glutamic residues present in the domain are potential carboxylation
 sites; in coagulation proteins, all are modified to Gla, while in BGP and MGP
 some are not.
