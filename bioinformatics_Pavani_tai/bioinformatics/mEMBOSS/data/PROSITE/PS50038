* Frizzled (fz) domain profile *
********************************

The  frizzled (fz) domain is an extracellular domain of about 120 amino acids.
It was  first  identified  in  the alpha-1 chain of type XVIII collagen and in
members of the Frizzled family of seven transmembrane (7TM) proteins which act
as receptors  for  secreted  Wingless (Wg)/Wnt glycoproteins (see <PDOC00219>)
[1]. In  addition  to  these  proteins, one or two copies of the fz domain are
also found [2,3,4,5,6] in:

 - The frizbee (Frzb) family; secreted frizzled-like proteins.
 - Smoothened; another 7TM receptor involved in hedgehog signaling.
 - Carboxpeptidase Z (CPZ).
 - Transmembrane serine protease corin.
 - Two  receptor  tyrosine  kinases (RTKs) subfamilies, the Ror family and the
   muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) family.

As the  fz  domain  contains  10 cysteines which are largely conserved, it has
also been  called  cysteine-rich domain (CRD) [1]. The fz domain also contains
several other  highly  conserved  residues,  for  example,  a basic amino acid
follows C6,  and a conserved proline residues lies four residues C-terminal to
C9 [5].  The  crystal  structure of a fz domain shows that it is predominantly
alpha-helical with  all  cysteines  forming  disulfide  bonds.  In addition to
helical regions, two short beta-strands at the N-terminus form a minimal beta-
sheet with  the  second beta sheet passing through a knot created by disulfide
bonds [7].

The schematic  representation of the structure of a typical fz domain is shown
below:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

Several  fz  domains  have  been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for
Wg/Wnt  ligand  binding,  strongly  suggesting  that the fz domain is a Wg/Wnt
interacting domain [8,9,10].

The profile we developed covers the entire fz domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
