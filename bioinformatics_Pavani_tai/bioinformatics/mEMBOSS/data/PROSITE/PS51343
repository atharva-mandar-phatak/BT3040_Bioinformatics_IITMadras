* P-II protein family signatures and profile *
**********************************************

P-II  family  proteins are regulators of nitrogen metabolism, with a length of
~110 amino acid residues, found throughout the bacteria and most archaea. P-II
proteins sense cellular 2-oxoglutarate as an indicator for nitrogen limitation
and  bind and respond to ATP. The family is named after the P-II protein (gene
glnB),  a  bacterial protein important for the control of glutamine synthetase
[1,2,3].  In  nitrogen-limiting  conditions,  when  the  ratio of glutamine to
2-ketoglutarate  decreases, P-II is uridylylated on a tyrosine residue to form
P-II-UMP. P-II-UMP allows the deadenylation of glutamine synthetase (GS), thus
activating   the   enzyme.   Conversely,   in  nitrogen  excess,  P-II-UMP  is
deuridylated  and  then  promotes  the adenylation of GS. P-II also indirectly
controls the transcription of the GS gene (glnA) by preventing NR-II (ntrB) to
phosphorylate NR-I (ntrC) which is the transcriptional activator of glnA. Once
P-II  is  uridylylated,  these  events  are  reversed.  The  tyrosine which is
uridylated is located in the T-loop in the central part of the protein.

Not  all  P-II  family  proteins have this site for sensing cellular glutamine
[4].  In  cyanobacteria,  P-II  seems to be phosphorylated on a serine residue
rather than being uridylated. It has a different set of interacting proteins.

In  methanogenic archaebacteria, the  nitrogenase iron  protein gene (nifH) is
followed by two  open reading  frames highly  similar  to the eubacterial P-II
protein [5].  These  proteins could be involved in  the regulation of nitrogen
fixation.

In the  red  alga,  Porphyra  purpurea, there is a glnB homolog encoded in the
chloroplast genome.

Other proteins highly similar to glnB are:

 - Bacillus subtilis protein nrgB [6].
 - Escherichia coli glnK [7].
 - Plant P-II protein, which is localized to the chloroplast [8].

We  developed  two  signature  patterns  for  P-II protein. The first one is a
conserved   stretch  (in  eubacteria)  of  six  residues  which  contains  the
uridylated  tyrosine,  the  other is derived from a conserved region in the C-
terminal part of the P-II protein. We also developed a profile that covers the
whole P-II protein.
