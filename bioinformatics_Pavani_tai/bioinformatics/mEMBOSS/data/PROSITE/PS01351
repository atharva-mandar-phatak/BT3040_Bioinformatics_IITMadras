* MAP kinase signature *
************************

Mitogen-activated protein  kinases  (EC  2.7.11.24)  (MAP kinases, also called
ERKs for  extracellularly-regulated kinases)  form a group of serine/threonine
protein   kinases   (see <PDOC00100>)  that  play  important  roles  in signal
transduction  pathways  regulating  adaptative  response  to a  wide  range of
stimuli.

Almost all MAPKs possess a conserved TXY motif in which both the threonine and
tyrosine residues  are    phosphorylated  during  activation  of the enzyme by
upstream dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs).

However the TXY motif is not enough conserved to develop a pattern. The region
we selected for our pattern is located just after the TXY motif and contains a
F and a C residue  that are MAPK-specific. The R and E residues in  the  first
part of  our  pattern,  and  the  R,  D and K residues in the second part, are
shared by  many  additional  protein  kinases.  They have been included in the
pattern to  eliminate matches from unrelated sequences in the database, and to
"anchor" the MAPK-specific F and C residues to this region [3,4].

-Consensus pattern: F-x(10)-R-E-x(72,86)-R-D-x-K-x(9)-[CS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Does not detect  MAPK4/ERK4 and MAPK6/ERK3 which are probably  not real
       MAP kinases.
