* RNA polymerases beta chain signature *
****************************************

DNA-dependent RNA  polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6) are  ubiquitous enzymes  necessary
for the  transcription  of  genomic  DNA  into  RNA.  Most RNA polymerases are
multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits.  However
the two  largest  subunits  (generally  known  as  alpha  and beta chains) are
present in all known multimeric RNA polymerases.  The  beta chain is currently
known in:

 - Eubacterial RNA polymerase beta chain (gene rpoB).
 - Plants and algal chloroplast RNA polymerase beta chain (gene rpoB).
 - Eukaryotes RNA polymerases I, II and III second largest subunits.
 - Archebacterial RNA polymerase subunit B (gene rpoB) or B' (gene rpoB1).
 - Poxviruses RNA polymerase 132 Kd subunit (gene RPO132).
 - Baculoviruses RNA polymerase subunit LEF-8.
 - African swine fever virus RNA polymerase subunit EP1242L.
 - Fungal plasmid-encoded RNA polymerases.

The beta  chains are proteins of from 900 to 1400 amino acid residues.  A well
conserved region of 13  residues that contains two conserved lysines and which
is thought to be part of the  active site is located in the C-terminal part of
all beta chains [1]. We have used this region as a signature pattern.
