* YTH domain profile *
**********************

The YTH  (for  YT521-B  homology)  is  a  100-150-residue domain that has been
identified in   the   mammalian  pre-mRNA  splicing  factor  YT521-B  and  its
Drosophila and  yeast  homologues.  The  YTH  domain  is  found in a number of
eukaryotic nuclear  proteins of unknown function that could be involved in RNA
binding. It  is  particularly  abundant  in  plants. The YTH domain is usually
located in  the middle of the protein sequence. It has been predicted that the
biological function of the YTH domain is to bind to RNA [1].

The YTH  domain is predicted to have a mixed alpha-helix-beta-sheet fold, with
four alpha-helices  and six beta-strands. The conservation pattern follows the
predicted secondary   structure,  with  three  blocks  of  conserved  sequence
separated by  loops  of  variable size. Notable features of the YTH domain are
the highly conserved aromatic residues located in the beta-sheet [1].

Some proteins known to contain a YTH domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian putative splicing factor YT521.
 - Human  dermatomyositis associated with cancer putative autoantigen-1 (DACA-
   1) and its mammalian homologs.
 - Human high-glucose-regulated protein 8 and its mammalian homologs.

The profile we developed covers the entire YTH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2003 / First entry.
