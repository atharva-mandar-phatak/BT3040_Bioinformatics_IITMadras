* Acetate and butyrate kinases family signatures *
**************************************************

The following enzymes have been shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related:

 - Acetate  kinase  (EC  2.7.2.1)  (acetokinase) (gene ackA) from bacteria and
   archaebacteria. This enzyme  is  involved in the interconversion of acetate
   and acetyl-CoA  via  the acetyl phosphate intermediate. In anaerobic growth
   it provides ATP by catabolyzing acetate phosphate into acetate.
 - Butyrate  kinase  (EC  2.7.2.7) (gene buk). This enzyme  is involved in the
   interconversion of  butyrate  and  butyryl-CoA  via  the  butyryl phosphate
   intermediate.  Butyrate kinase  is  involved  in  the  acidogenic  phase of
   fermentation.
 - Propionate kinase (EC 2.7.2,.) (gene tdcD) from Escherichia coli.

We have developed two signature  patterns for these enzymes;  the first one is
located in the N-terminal section and the second in the central section.  Both
of them are glycine-rich and could be involved in substrate or ATP-binding.
