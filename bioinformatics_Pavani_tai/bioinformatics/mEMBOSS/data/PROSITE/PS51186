* Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain profile *
**********************************************************

The  N-acetyltransferases  (NAT)  (EC  2.3.1.-)  are  enzymes  that use acetyl
coenzyme  A  (CoA)  to  transfer  an  acetyl  group to a substrate, a reaction
implicated  in  various  functions  from  bacterial  antibiotic  resistance to
mammalian   circadian   rhythm  and  chromatin  remodeling.  The  Gcn5-related
N-acetyltransferases  (GNAT)  catalyze the transfer of the acetyl from the CoA
donor  to  a  primary  amine of the acceptor. The GNAT proteins share a domain
composed  of  four  conserved  sequence  motifs A-D [1,2]. This GNAT domain is
named after yeast GCN5 (from General Control Nonrepressed) and related histone
acetyltransferases  (HATs)  like Hat1 and PCAF. HATs acetylate lysine residues
of  amino  terminal  histone  tails,  resulting  in  transcription activation.
Another  category  of  GNAT,  the  aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases, confer
antibiotic  resistance  by  catalyzing  the  acetylation  of  amino  groups in
aminoglycoside  antibiotics  [3].  GNAT  proteins  can  also have anabolic and
catabolic functions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [1-5].

The  acetyltransferase/GNAT domain forms a structurally conserved fold of 6 to
7    beta    strands    (B)    and    4    helices   (H)   in   the   topology
B1-H1-H2-B2-B3-B4-H3-B5-H4-B6,  followed  by  a C-terminal strand which may be
from the same monomer or contributed by another [2,5] (see <PDB:1YGH>). Motifs
D  (B2-B3),  A  (B4-H3)  and  B  (B5-H4)  are collectively called the HAT core
[2,4,5], while the N-terminal motif C (B1-H1) is less conserved.

Some proteins known to contain a GNAT domain:

 - Yeast GCN5 and Hat1, which are histone acetyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.48).
 - Human PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase.
 - Mammalian   serotonin  N-acetyltransferase  (SNAT)  or  arylalkylamine  NAT
   (AANAT),  which acetylates serotonin into a circadian neurohormone that may
   participate in light-dark rhythms, and human mood and behavior.
 - Mammalian glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) (EC 2.3.1.4).
 - Escherichia  coli  rimI and rimJ, which acetylate the N-terminal alanine of
   ribosomal proteins S18 and S5, respectively (EC 2.3.1.128).
 - Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  aminoglycoside  2'-N-acetyltransferase  (aac),
   which  acetylates  the  2'  hydroxyl  or amino group of a broad spectrum of
   aminoglycoside antibiotics.
 - Bacillus subtilis bltD and paiA, which acetylate spermine and spermidine.

The profile we developed covers the entire GNAT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
