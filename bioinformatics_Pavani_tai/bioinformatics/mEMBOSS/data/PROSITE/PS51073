* RPEL repeat profile *
***********************

RPEL repeat  (RPxxxEL)  containing  proteins  are  found  in  a  wide range of
metazoan organisms.   RPEL   repeats  have  been  shown  to  be  required  for
unpolymerized actin  binding  and proteins containing RPEL repeats are able to
modify cell shape and/or are important in the regulation of gene expression by
the actin  cytoskeleton. RPEL repeats can be found in association with the SAP
motif (see <PDOC50800>), which could be involved in DNA binding [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain RPEL repeats are listed below:

 - Mammalian   myocardin,  heart-specific  serum  response  factor  (SRF)  co-
   activator.
 - Vertebrate  myocardin-related  transcription  factor  A  (MRTF-A or MAL), a
   signal-regulated SRF co-activator.
 - Vertebrate myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTF-B).
 - Mammalian phosphatase and actin regulator 1 to 3.

The profile we developed covers the entire RPEL repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
