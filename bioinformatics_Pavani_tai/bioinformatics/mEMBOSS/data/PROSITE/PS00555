* Plant viruses icosahedral capsid proteins 'S' region signature *
******************************************************************

The capsid protein of plant  icosahedral positive strand RNA viruses generally
consists of four distinct domains: an N-terminal positively charged 'R' domain
involved in the  interaction with RNA,  a connecting arm 'a', a central domain
'S' forming the virion shell, and a C-terminal projecting 'P' domain.  Some of
the viruses lack either the R or P domains.

It has been shown [1] that the S domain  of the  capsid protein of a number of
plant viruses are evolutionary related, namely:

 - Carmoviruses: carnation mottle  virus (CarMV),  melon  necrotic  spot virus
   (MNSV), and turnip crinkle virus (TCV).
 - Dianthoviruses: red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV).
 - Sobemoviruses: maize  chlorotic  mottle  virus  (MCMV),  and  southern bean
   mosaic virus (SBMV).
 - Tombusviruses: artichoke mottled  crinkle virus (AMCV),  cucumber  necrosis
   virus (CNV), cymbidium ringspot virus (CyRSV), and tomato bushy stunt virus
   (TBSV).
 - Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV).

The S domain of these viruses  contains  from 158  to  166 amino acids  and is
composed of eight beta-strand anti-parallel twisted sheets in what is known as
a 'jellyroll' conformation.  The  signature  pattern for this domain starts at
the C-terminal  part of the 3rd  beta-strand  and extends up to the end of the
4th strand.
