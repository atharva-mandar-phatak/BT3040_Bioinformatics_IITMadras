* Gas vesicles protein GVPa signatures *
****************************************

Gas vesicles are small, hollow, gas filled protein structures found in several
cyanobacterial  and archaebacterial     microorganisms  [1].  They  allow  the
positioning of  the  bacteria  at the favorable depth for growth. Gas vesicles
are hollow    cylindrical tubes, closed by a hollow, conical cap  at each end.
Both the    conical  end caps and central cylinder are made  up of 4-5 nm wide
ribs that  run at right angles to the long axis of the structure. Gas vesicles
seem to be constituted of two different protein components: GVPa and GVPc.

GVPa, a small protein of about 70 amino acid residues, is the main constituent
of gas vesicles and form the essential core of the structure.  The sequence of
GVPa is extremely well conserved.

GvpJ and  gvpM,  two proteins encoded in the cluster of genes required for gas
vesicle synthesis  in  the archaebacteria Halobacterium halobium and Haloferax
mediterranei, have  been  found  [2]  to  be evolutionary related to GVPa. The
exact  function of  these    two proteins is not known, although they could be
important for determining the shape determination gas vesicles.

The N-terminal  domain  of  Aphanizomenon  flos-aquae  protein  gvpA/J is also
related to GVPa.

We developed two  signature  patterns for this family of proteins.  The  first
pattern  is located in the N-terminal  section while  the  second is in the C-
terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[DE]-[LIVMFYT]-[LIVM]-[DE]-x-[LIVM](2)-[DKR](2)-
                    G-x-[LIVMA]-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: R-[LIVA](3)-A-[GS]-[LIVMFY]-x-[TK]-x(3)-[YFI]-[AG]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Aphanizomenon flos-aquae gvpA/J.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Patterns and text revised.
