* Fumarate lyases signature *
*****************************

A number of enzymes, belonging  to  the lyase class,  for  which fumarate is a
substrate have been shown [1,2]  to  share a short conserved sequence around a
methionine which is  probably involved  in the catalytic activity of this type
of enzymes. These enzymes are:

 - Fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2) (fumarate hydratase), which catalyzes  the reversible
   hydration of fumarate to L-malate. There seem to be 2 classes of fumarases:
   class I are thermolabile dimeric enzymes  (as for example: Escherichia coli
   fumC); class II enzymes  are  thermostable  and tetrameric and are found in
   prokaryotes (as for example: Escherichia coli fumA and fumB) as well as  in
   eukaryotes.  The  sequence  of the two classes of fumarases are not closely
   related.
 - Aspartate  ammonia-lyase  (EC 4.3.1.1)  (aspartase),  which  catalyzes  the
   reversible conversion of  aspartate to fumarate and ammonia.  This reaction
   is analogous to that catalyzed by fumarase, except that ammonia rather than
   water is involved in the trans-elimination reaction.
 - Arginosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.1) (argininosuccinate lyase), which catalyzes the
   formation of arginine and fumarate from argininosuccinate, the last step in
   the biosynthesis of arginine.
 - Adenylosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.2) (adenylosuccinate lyase) [3], which catalyzes
   the eight step  in  the de novo  biosynthesis  of purines, the formation of
   5'-phosphoribosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide  and  fumarate  from 1-(5-
   phosphoribosyl)-4-(N-succino-carboxamide).  That enzyme  can also catalyzes
   the formation of fumarate and AMP from adenylosuccinate.
 - Pseudomonas  putida  3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.2)
   (3-carboxymuconate lactonizing  enzyme) (gene pcaB) [4], an enzyme involved
   in aromatic acids catabolism.

-Consensus pattern: G-S-x(2)-M-x-{RS}-K-x-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 8.
