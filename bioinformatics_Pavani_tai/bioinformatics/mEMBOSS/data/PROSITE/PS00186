* Isopenicillin N synthase signatures *
***************************************

Isopenicillin N  synthase  (EC  1.21.3.1)  (IPNS) [1,2] is a key enzyme in the
biosynthesis of  penicillin  and cephalosporin.  In the presence of oxygen, it
removes  iron and ascorbate, four hydrogen atoms from L-(alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-
cysteinyl-d-valine to   form   the   azetidinone  and  thiazolidine  rings  of
isopenicillin.  IPNS is  an  enzyme  of  about  330  amino-acid  residues. Two
cysteines are  conserved in fungal and bacterial  IPNS  sequences;  these  may
be involved in iron-binding and/or substrate-binding.

Cephalosporium acremonium DAOCS/DACS [3] is a bifunctional  enzyme involved in
cephalosporin biosynthesis. The DAOCS domain, which is structurally related to
IPNS, catalyzes the step from penicillin N to deacetoxy-cephalosporin C - used
as a   substrate   by  DACS  to  form  deacetylcephalosporin  C.  Streptomyces
clavuligerus possesses  a  monofunctional  DAOCS  enzyme  (gene cefE) [4] also
related to IPNS.

We derived  two  signature  patterns  for  these  enzymes, centered around the
conserved cysteine residues.

-Consensus pattern: [RK]-x-[STA]-x(2)-S-x-C-Y-[SL]
                    [C may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Streptomyces clavuligerus  DAOCS  which has  Ser in the first position of
 the pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 6.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-x-C-G-[STA]-x(2)-[STAG]-x(2)-T-x-[DNG]
                    [C may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Nocardia lactamdurans IPNS.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
