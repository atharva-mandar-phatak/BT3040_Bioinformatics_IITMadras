* COE family signature *
************************

The independent cloning of rodent EBF/Olf-1 and Drosophila Collier has defined
a family of transcription factors, the Collier or COE family [1]. COE proteins
have various  functions  in  different  organisms. Proteins currently known to
belong to this family are listed below:

 - Mammalian  COE1  (OLF-1;  EBF-1; OE-1), COE2 (EBF-2; OE-3) and COE3 (EBF-3;
   OE-2).
 - Xenopus XCOE2 and XCOE3.
 - Zebrafish ZCOE2.
 - Drosophila Collier.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans unc-3.

In mouse,  COE1 has a role in B-cell differentiation, and could also perform a
role in  neuronal  differentiation.  All  three  COE are expressed in immature
olfactory neuronal  precursors  and  mature  olfactory  neurons  as well as in
developping nervous system during embryogenesis.

In Drosophila,  Collier  is involved in the formation of the embryonic somatic
muscle DA3,  in  the  patterning  of  the wing by mediating Hedgehog activity.
It could  also  act as a second-level regulator in the patterning of embryonic
head.

In Xenopus, XCOE2  is expressed in precursors of primary neurons, and may play
a pivotal  role  in  the transcriptional cascade specifying primary neurons in
embryo. It promotes neuronal differentiation by activating XNeuroD expression.

In Zebrafish, ZCOE2  is  expressed  in  a subset of primary neuroblasts in the
spinal cord and at later stages is a marker of the olfactory placodes.

Caenorhabditis elegans mutants for unc-3 move abnormally suggesting that unc-3
might regulate expression of genes involved in growth cone pioneering long the
ventral cord or in fasciculation.

As a  signature  for  these proteins we selected a conserved region located in
a domain  thought  to be part of the DNA-binding region. The signature pattern
includes four conserved cysteines that could be part of a zinc-finger motif.

-Consensus pattern: C-S-R-C-C-[DE]-[KR]-K-S-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 2002 / Pattern and text revised.
