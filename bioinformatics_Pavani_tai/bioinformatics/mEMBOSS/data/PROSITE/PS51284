**********************
* DOC domain profile *
**********************

The anaphase-promoting  complex  (APC) is a multi-subunit E3 protein ubiquitin
ligase that  is  reponsible  for  the metaphase to anaphase transition and the
exit from  mitosis.  The subunit APC10 is a one-domain protein homologous to a
sequence element,  termed  the  DOC  domain,  found  in  several  hypothetical
proteins that  may also mediate ubiquitination reactions, because they contain
combinations of either RING finger (see <PDOC00449>), cullin (see <PDOC00967>)
or HECT (see <PDOC50237>) domains [1-3].

The DOC   domain  consists  of  a  beta-sandwich,  in  which  a  five-stranded
antiparallel beta-sheet  is  packed  on  top  of a three stranded antiparallel
beta-sheet, exhibiting a 'jellyroll' fold (see <PDB:1JHJ; A>) [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a DOC domain are listed below:

 - Eucaryotic Doc1/Apc10.
 - Mammalian protein associated with the transcription factor Myc (PAM).
 - Mouse runty-jerky-sterile (RJS) protein.
 - Human HERC2, the ortholog of RJS.

The profile we developed covers the entire DOC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
