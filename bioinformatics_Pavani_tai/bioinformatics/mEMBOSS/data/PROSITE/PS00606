Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase   (EC  2.3.1.41)  (KAS)  [1]  is  the  enzyme  that
catalyzes the  condensation of  malonyl-ACP with the growing fatty acid chain.
It is found as a component of the following enzymatic systems:

 - Fatty  acid  synthase  (FAS),  which  catalyzes the formation of long-chain
   fatty acids  from  acetyl-CoA,  malonyl-CoA  and NADPH. Bacterial and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   different enzymatic  activities;    beta-ketoacyl  synthase is one of these
   polypeptides. Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and
   FAS2; the  beta-ketoacyl  synthase domain  is  located  in  the  C-terminal
   section of FAS2. Vertebrate FAS consists of a single multifunctional chain;
   the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain is located in the N-terminal section [2].
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium
   patulum [3].  This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis
   of a  polyketide  antibiotic  and  which has a KAS domain in its N-terminal
   section.
 - Polyketide antibiotic  synthase enzyme systems.   Polyketides are secondary
   metabolites produced by microorganisms and plants from simple  fatty acids.
   KAS is   one  of  the  components  involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the
   Streptomyces polyketide  antibiotics  granatacin [4],  tetracenomycin C [5]
   and erythromycin.
 - Emericella nidulans  multifunctional  protein  Wa.  Wa  is  involved in the
   biosynthesis of  conidial  green  pigment.  Wa  is  protein  of 216 Kd that
   contains a KAS domain.
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodE, which probably acts as  a  beta-ketoacyl
   synthase in the synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain.
 - Yeast mitochondrial protein CEM1.

The condensation reaction is a two step process:  the  acyl  component  of  an
activated acyl primer is transferred to a  cysteine residue  of the enzyme and
is then condensed with an activated malonyl donor with the concomitant release
of carbon  dioxide.  The  sequence  around  the  active  site cysteine is well
conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-{A}-{KGR}-x(2)-[LIVMFTAP]-{R}-x-[AGC]-C-[STA](2)-[STAG]-
                    x(2)-{LI}-[LIVMF]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for bacterial and plant beta-ketoacyl synthase III (KAS III).
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 15.
