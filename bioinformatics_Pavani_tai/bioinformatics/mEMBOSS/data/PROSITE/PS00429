* Staphylocoagulase repeat signature *
**************************************

Staphylocoagulase [1,2] is  an  extracellular  protein  produced   by  several
strains of Staphylococcus aureus and  which specifically forms a complex  with
prothrombin. This  complex named staphylothrombin  can clot fibrinogen without
any proteolytic cleavage of prothrombin.

The C-terminal of staphylocoagulase consists  in the tandem repeat of a domain
of 27 amino acids.  There are from 6 to 8  of these repeats,  depending on the
strain of Staphylococcus aureus.  The region  containing  these repeats is not
required for the procoagulant activity.

We have  derived a signature  pattern specific  for  the 27 residues repeat of
staphylocoagulase.

-Consensus pattern: A-R-P-x(3)-K-x-S-x-T-N-A-Y-N-V-T-T-x(2)-[DN]-G-x(3)-Y-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1990 / First entry.
