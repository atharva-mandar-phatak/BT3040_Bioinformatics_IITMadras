* C1q domain profile *
**********************

C1q is  a subunit of the C1 enzyme complex that activates the serum complement
system.  It is composed of 9 disulfide-linked dimers of the chains A, B and C,
which share  a  common  structure  which  consist  of  a N-terminal nonhelical
region, a  triple  helical (collagenous) region and a C-terminal globular head
which is called the C1q domain. That domain consists of  about 136 amino acids
which probably form ten beta strands interspersed by  beta-turns  and/or loops
[1]. Such a domain has been found in the C-terminus of  vertebrate secreted or
membrane-bound proteins which are mostly short-chain  collagens and  collagen-
like molecules [1-4]. These proteins are listed below:

 - Complement  C1q subcomponent  chains A, B and C. Efficient activation of C1
   takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions
   of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.
 - Vertebrate short-chain  collagen  type  VIII,  the major  component  of the
   basement membrane  of corneal endothelial cells. It is composed of a triple
   helical domain  in  between  a  short  N-terminal and  a  larger C-terminal
   globule which contains the C1q domain.
 - Vertebrate collagen type X, which has the same structure than collagen type
   VIII. It is a product of hyperthrophic chondrotocytes.
 - Bluegill  inner-ear  specific structural protein. This short-chain collagen
   forms a microstructural matrix within the otolithic membrane.
 - Chipmunk hibernation-associated plasma  proteins  HP-20,  HP-25  and HP-27.
   These proteins disappear from blood  specifically during  hibernation. They
   contain a collagen-like  domain  near  the  N-terminus and a C-terminal C1q
   domain.
 - Human  precerebellin, which  is  located  within postsynaptic structures of
   Purkinje cells, probably membrane-bound. Cerebellin is involved in synaptic
   activity.
 - Rat precerebellin-like  glycoprotein, a probable membrane protein.  The C1q
   domain is located at the C-terminal extracellular extremity.
 - Human  endothelial  cell  multimerin  (ECM), a carrier protein for platelet
   factor V/VA.
 - Vertebrate  30 Kd adipocyte complement-related protein (ACRP30), also known
   as ApM1 or AdipoQ.

The C-terminal  globular  domain  of  the C1q subcomponents and collagen types
VIII and  X  is  important  both  for the correct folding and alignment of the
triple helix  and  for  protein-protein recognition events [5,6]. For collagen
type X  it  has been suggested that the domain is important for initiation and
maintenance of the correct assembly of the protein [7].

There are  two well conserved regions within the C1q domain: an aromatic motif
is located  within the first half of the domain, the other conserved region is
located near the C-terminal extremity.
