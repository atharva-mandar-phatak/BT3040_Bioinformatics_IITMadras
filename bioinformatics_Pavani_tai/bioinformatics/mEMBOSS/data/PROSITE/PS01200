* Tub family signatures *
*************************

The mouse  tubby mutation is  the  cause  of  maturity-onset  obesity, insulin
resistance and  sensory  deficits.  This  mutation  maps to a gene, tub [1,2],
which codes for a protein that belongs to a family which currently consists of
the following members:

 - Mammalian tub, an hydrophilic protein of about 500 residues, which could be
   involved in the hypothalamic regulation of body weight.
 - Human    protein   TULP1 [3] is involved in retinis pigmentosa 14 (RP14), a
   retinal degeneration disease.
 - Human protein TULP2 [3].
 - Mammalian protein TULP3 [4].
 - Mouse protein p4-6 whose function is not known.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F10B5.4.
 - Several fragmentary sequences from plants, Drosophila and human ESTs.

While the  N-terminal  part of these protein is not conserved in length nor in
the sequence,  the  C-terminal 250 residues are highly conserved. We therefore
selected two regions in the C-terminal part as signature patterns.  The second
region is  located  at  the  C-terminal  extremity  and contains a penultimate
cysteine residue  that  could  be  critical to the normal functioning of these
proteins.

-Consensus pattern: F-[KRHQ]-G-R-V-[ST]-x-A-S-V-K-N-F-Q
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: A-F-[AG]-I-[GSAC]-[LIVM]-[ST]-S-F-x-[GST]-K-x-A-C-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for TULP2.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
