*********************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family F [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 10  [4,E1].    The  enzymes which are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Aspergillus awamori xylanase A (xynA).
 - Bacillus sp. strain 125 xylanase (xynA).
 - Bacillus stearothermophilus xylanase.
 - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens xylanases A (xynA) and B (xynB).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum bifunctional endoglucanase/exoglucanase (celB).
   This protein consists of two  domains; it  is  the N-terminal domain, which
   has exoglucanase activity, which belongs to this family.
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum xylanase A (xynA).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum ORF4.   This hypothetical protein is encoded in
   the xynABC operon and is probably a xylanase.
 - Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase/xylanase (cex).
 - Clostridium stercorarium thermostable celloxylanase.
 - Clostridium thermocellum xylanases Y (xynY) and Z (xynZ).
 - Cryptococcus albidus xylanase.
 - Penicillium chrysogenum xylanase (gene xylP).
 - Pseudomonas fluorescens xylanases A (xynA) and B (xynB).
 - Ruminococcus flavefaciens bifunctional xylanase XYLA (xynA).  This  protein
   consists of  three  domains: a N-terminal xylanase  catalytic  domain  that
   belongs to family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases; a  central domain  composed of
   short repeats  of Gln, Asn an Trp,  and  a  C-terminal  xylanase  catalytic
   domain that belongs to family 10 of glycosyl hydrolases.
 - Streptomyces lividans xylanase A (xlnA).
 - Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum endoxylanase A (xynA).
 - Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase.
 - Thermophilic bacterium Rt8.B4 xylanase (xynA).

One of the conserved regions in  these enzymes  is  centered  on  a  conserved
glutamic acid  residue  which  has been shown [5],  in  the  exoglucanase from
Cellulomonas fimi, to  be directly involved  in  glycosidic  bond  cleavage by
acting as a nucleophile. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [GTA]-{QNAG}-{GSV}-[LIVN]-x-[IVMF]-[ST]-E-[LIY]-[DN]-
                    [LIVMF]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase whose sequence seems to be incorrect.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 16.
