*********************************
* LytTR-type HTH domain profile *
*********************************

The   LytTR   ('litter')   HTH  domain  is  a  DNA-binding,  potential  winged
helix-turn-helix  (wHTH) domain of about 100 amino acids, present in bacterial
transcriptional  regulators  of  the  algR/agrA/lytR family. It is named after
Bacillus  subtilis  LytT  and  Staphylococcus aureus lytR response regulators,
involved in the regulation of cell autolysis [1]. The LytTR domain is found in
several  bacterial  cytoplasmic  proteins  that  regulate  the  production  of
important  virulence  factors,  like extracellular polysaccharides, toxins and
bacteriocins.  These response regulators of the microbial two-component signal
transduction  systems  contain  N-terminal cheY-like domains (see <PDOC50110>)
and  the  LytTR  domain in the C-terminal part is expected to bind to specific
DNA sequences in the upstream regions of target genes [2]. Other domains found
N-terminally of LytTR are an ATP-binding domain of ABC-type transporter family
(see   <PDOC00185>)   and  a  PAS  domain  (see  <PDOC50112>).  Besides  these
cytoplasmic  proteins, LytTR also occurs in membrane-bound bacterial proteins.
The  N-terminal  parts  of  these  proteins  contain  three to eight predicted
transmembrane segments or the transmembrane MHYT domain (see <PDOC50924>).

According to secondary structure predictions the LytTR domain consists of four
beta-strands  and  three  alpha-helices.  The structure is predicted to form a
novel  type  of  DNA-binding domain, showing similarity to the 'winged HTH' or
'winged helix' proteins [1,2].

Some cytoplasmic proteins known to contain a LytTR domain:

 - Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  algR,  a transcriptional regulator involved in the
   pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis, in the regulation of alginate biosynthesis
   and twitching motility.
 - Clostridium  perfringens virR, involved in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene
   as  a regulator of virulence factors such as perfringolysin O, collagenase,
   hemagglutinin.
 - Staphylococcus  aureus  agrA  and lytR, regulators of virulence factors and
   peptidoglycan turnover. AgrA is involved in the pathogenesis of toxic shock
   syndrome  as a quorum-sensing regulator of expression of toxins, hemolysins
   and other virulence factors.
 - Klepsiella pneumoniae mrkE, a regulator of fimbrial expression.
 - Streptococcus  pneumoniae  comE  and  blpR,  quorum-sensing autocatalytical
   response   regulators   of   competence  and  of  bacteriocin-like  peptide
   production essential for survival, respectively.
 - Escherichia coli mrkE and yehT.
 - Bacillus subtilis lytT.

Some membrane-bound proteins known to contain a LytTR domain:

 - Oligotropha carboxidovorans coxC and coxH.
 - Xanthomonas campestris rpfD.
 - Caulobacter crescentus CC0295, CC0330, CC0551, CC1610 and CC3036.
