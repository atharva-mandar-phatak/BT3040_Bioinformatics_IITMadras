* Scorpion calcine family signature *
*************************************

Toxins of  the  scorpion  calcine  family bind directly to ryanodine receptors
(RyRs), intracellular channel targets of the endoplasmic reticulum, and induce
long lasting  channel openings in a mode of smaller conductance. They have the
ability to translocate into cells by crossing the plasma membrane [1-3].

Toxins of scorpion calcine family are highly basic 33-amino acid peptides that
present three  disulfide  bridges  (C1-C4,  C2-C5, and C3-C6) and fold along a
knottin or  inhibitor  cystine  knot motif (see <PDOC60004>) [1-3] [E1]. Their
three dimensional  structure  consists of a compact disulfide-bonded core from
which emerge  loops  and the N-terminus. The main element of regular secondary
structure is  a  double-stranded  antiparallel  beta-sheet. A third peripheral
extended strand  is  almost  perpendicular to the double-stranded antiparallel
beta-sheet [2,4].  Scorpion  calcine  mimic  the  activating  segment  of  the
dihydropyridine receptor  II-III  loop,  which  interacts with a region of the
ryanodine receptor (see <PDB:1C6W>) [1,2,5].

This family includes:

 - Imperatoxin-A (IpTx A) from Pandinus imperator (Emperor scorpion).
 - Opicalcin-1  and  -2  from  Opistophthalmus  carinatus  (African yellow leg
   scorpion).
 - Maurocalcin (MCa) from Scorpio maurus palmatus (Chactoid scorpion).

We have  developed  a  pattern  that  contains  six conserved cysteines with a
C-C-CC-C-C cysteine arrangement.

-Conserved pattern: C-x(6)-C-x(5)-C-C-x(3)-C-x(9)-R-C
                    [The 6 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
