* Paired domain signature and profile *
***************************************

The  paired  domain is a ~126 amino acid DNA-binding domain, which is found in
eukaryotic  transcription  regulatory  proteins involved in embryogenesis. The
domain  was originally described as the 'paired box' in the Drosophila protein
paired  (prd)  [1,2]. The paired domain is generally located in the N-terminal
part.  An  octapeptide  [3]  and/or  a homeodomain (see <PDOC00027>) can occur
C-terminal  to  the  paired  domain, as well as a Pro-Ser-Thr-rich C-terminus.
Paired domain proteins can function as transcription repressors or activators.
The paired domain contains three subdomains, which show functional differences
in DNA-binding.

The  crystal structures of prd and Pax proteins show that the DNA-bound paired
domain  is bipartite, consisting of an N-terminal subdomain (PAI or NTD) and a
C-terminal subdomain (RED or CTD), connected by a linker (see <PDB:1K78>). PAI
and  RED  each  form  a  three-helical  fold, with the most C-terminal helices
comprising  a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that binds the DNA major groove. In
addition,   the   PAI   subdomain  encompasses  an  N-terminal  beta-turn  and
beta-hairpin,  also named 'wing', participating in DNA-binding. The linker can
bind into the DNA minor groove. Different Pax proteins and their alternatively
spliced  isoforms  use  different  (sub)domains for DNA-binding to mediate the
specificity of sequence recognition [4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a paired domain:

 - Drosophila paired (prd), a segmentation pair-rule class protein.
 - Drosophila  gooseberry  proximal  (gsb-p)  and  gooseberry  distal (gsb-d),
   segmentation polarity class proteins.
 - Drosophila Pox-meso and Pox-neuro proteins.

 The Pax proteins:
 - Mammalian protein Pax1, which may play a role in the formation of segmented
   structures in the embryo. In mouse, mutations in Pax1 produce the undulated
   phenotype, characterized   by  vertebral  malformations  along  the  entire
   rostro-caudal axis.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax2,  a  probable transcription factor that may have a
   role in kidney cell differentiation.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax3.  Pax3  is expressed during early neurogenesis. In
   Man, defects  in  Pax3  are  the  cause  of Waardenburg's syndrome (WS), an
   autosomal dominant combination of deafness and pigmentary disturbance.
 - Mammalian  protein Pax5, also known as B-cell specific transcription factor
   (BSAP).  Pax5  is  involved in the regulation of the CD19 gene. It plays an
   important  role in B-cell differentiation as well as neural development and
   spermatogenesis.
 - Mammalian  protein Pax6 (oculorhombin). Pax6 is a transcription factor with
   important  functions  in eye and nasal development. In Man, defects in Pax6
   are  the  cause  of  aniridia type II (AN2), an autosomal dominant disorder
   characterized by complete or partial absence of the iris.
 - Mammalian protein Pax8, required in thyroid development.
 - Mammalian protein Pax9. In man, defects in Pax9 cause oligodontia.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pax[Zf-a] and Pax[Zf-b].

We  use  the  region  spanning  positions  34  to 50 of the paired domain as a
signature  pattern. This conserved region spans the DNA-binding HTH located in
the  N-terminal  subdomain. We also developed a profile that covers the entire
paired  domain,  including  the PAI and RED subdomains and which allows a more
sensitive detection.
