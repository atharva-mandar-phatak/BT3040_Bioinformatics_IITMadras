* Glycophorin A signature *
***************************

Glycophorin A is  the  major sialoglycoprotein  of  erythrocyte  membrane [1].
Structurally, glycophorin  A  consists of an  N-terminal extracellular domain,
heavily  glycosylated   on   serine and   threonine  residues,   followed by a
transmembrane region and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

In human there are two closely related forms: glycophorin A  which carries the
blood group M/N antigen, and  glycophorin  B which carries the blood group S/s
antigen.

The best conserved region of glycophorin A  is the transmembrane domain and we
have derived a consensus pattern from that region.

-Consensus pattern: I-I-x-[GAC]-V-M-A-G-[LIVM](2)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 1991 / Pattern and text revised.
