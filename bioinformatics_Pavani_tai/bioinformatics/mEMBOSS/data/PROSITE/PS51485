******************************
* Phytocyanin domain profile *
******************************

Among the  blue  copper  proteins with a single type I (or "blue") mononuclear
copper site,  the  plant-specific phytocyanins constitute a distinct subfamily
that can be further subdivided into the families of uclacyanins, stellacyanins,
plantacyanins, and   early   nodulins.   Stellacyanins   have  a  blue  copper
coordinated by two His, one Cys and one Gln. In plantacyanins and uclacyanins,
the ligands of the type-I Cu sites are two His, one Cys and one Met [1,2,3,4].
Early nodulins  lack  amino  acid  residues  that  coordinate  Cu, so they are
believed to   be  involved  in  unknown  processes  without  binding  Cu  [5].
Phytocyanins are found in chloropasts of higher plants.

The phytocyanin  domain  has a core of seven polypeptide strands arranged as a
beta-sandwich comprising  two beta-sheets, beta-sheet I and beta-sheet II (see
<PDB:1WS8>). Beta-sheet  I  consists  of  three beta-strands and beta-sheet II
consists of  four  beta-strands.  A disulfide bridge close the metal center is
characteristic for  phytocyanins,  in  contrast to azurins, pseudoazurins, and
plastocyanins, where  a  disulfide  bond  is located on the distal side of the
beta-barrel. This  disuldide bridge may play a crucial role in maintaining the
tertiary structure  of  the protein and/or the formation of the copper binding
center because  one  of  the  His  ligands of copper is followed directly by a
bridging Cys residue [1,2,3,,4].

Some proteins known to contain a phytocyanin domain are listed below:

 - Cucumber basic protein (CBP).
 - Spinach basic protein (SBP).
 - Cucumber stellacyanin (CST).
 - Zucchini mavicyanin.

The profile we developed covers the entire phytocyanin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
