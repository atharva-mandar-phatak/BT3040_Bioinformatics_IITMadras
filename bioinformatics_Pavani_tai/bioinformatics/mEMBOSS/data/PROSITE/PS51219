* Dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK) domain profile *
**********************************************

Dephospho-coenzyme A  kinase  (DPCK) (EC 2.7.1.24) catalyzes the final step in
coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, the phosphorylation of the 3'-hydroxyl group of
ribose using  ATP  as  a  phosphate  donor. DPCK is present in a wide range of
organisms, including  bacteria,  fungi,  plants and animals. Whereas bacterial
DPCK is  found  in stand-alone form, mammalian DPCK is associated with another
enzyme of the CoA biosynthetic pathway, phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase
(PPAT) (EC 2.7.7.3), in bifunctional coenzyme A synthase (CoA synthase) [1,2].

The DPCK  domain  contains  an  ATP/GTP-binding  Walker  A motif (P-loop) (see
<PDOC00017>) in  its  N-terminal extremity. It is structurally similar to many
nucleoside kinases   and   other   P-loop-containing  nucleotide  triphosphate
hydrolases, despite  having  negligible  sequence similarity to these enzymes.
The DPCK  domain  consists  of  five  parallel  beta-strands flanked by alpha-
helices (see <PDB:1JJV>) [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire DPCK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: June 2006 / Pattern removed, profile added and text revised.
