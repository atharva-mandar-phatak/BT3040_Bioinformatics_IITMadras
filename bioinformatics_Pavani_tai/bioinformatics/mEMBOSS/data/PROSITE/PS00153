* ATP synthase gamma subunit signature *
****************************************

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.3.14) [1,2]  is a component
of the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,
and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of
an oligomeric transmembrane sector, called CF(0), and a catalytic core, called
coupling factor  CF(1).  The  former  acts  as a proton channel; the latter is
composed of  five  subunits,  alpha,  beta,  gamma, delta and epsilon. Subunit
gamma is believed to be important in regulating  ATPase  activity and the flow
of protons  through the CF(0) complex.  The best conserved region of the gamma
subunit [3] is its C-terminus  which  seems  to  be essential for assembly and
catalysis.  As a  signature pattern to detect ATPase gamma subunits, we used a
14 residue conserved segment  where the last  amino acid is found one to three
residues from the C-terminal extremity.

-Consensus pattern: [IV]-T-x-E-x(2)-[DE]-x(3)-G-A-x-[SAKR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for pea chloroplast gamma and two Bacillus species gamma.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: November 1995 / Pattern and text revised.
