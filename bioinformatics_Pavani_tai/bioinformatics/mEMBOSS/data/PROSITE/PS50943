* Cro/C1-type HTH domain profile *
**********************************

The  cro/C1-type HTH domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  50-60  residues  present  in  transcriptional regulators. The domain is
named   after   the   transcriptional  repressors  cro  and  C1  of  temperate
bacteriophages  434  and  lambda,  respectively.  Besides  in  bacteriophages,
cro/C1-type  regulators  are  present  in  prokaryotes  and in eukaryotes. The
helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif is generally located in the N-terminal part
of  these  transcriptional  regulators.  The  C-terminal  part  may contain an
oligomerization  domain, e.g. C1 repressors and CopR act as dimers, while SinR
is  a tetramer. The cro/C1-type HTH domain also occurs in combination with the
TPR  repeat  and  the  C-terminal part of C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylases
contains regions related to the enzymatic function (see <PDOC00089>).

Several   structures  of  cro/C1-type  transcriptional  repressors  have  been
resolved and their DNA-binding domain encompasses five alpha helices, of which
the  extremities are less conserved (see <PDB:2OR1>) [1]. The helix-turn-helix
motif  comprises  the  second  and  third  helices, the third being called the
recognition  helix.  The HTH is involved in DNA-binding into the major groove,
where  the  recognition  helix  makes  most  DNA-contacts.  The  bacteriophage
repressors   regulate  lysogeny/lytic  growth  by  binding  with  differential
affinity  to  the  operators.  These  operators  show  2-fold symmetry and the
repressors  bind as dimers. Binding of the repressor to the operator positions
the DNA backbone into a slightly bent twist [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a cro/C1-type HTH domain:

 - Bacteriophage  434  cro and C1, transcriptional repressors that bind to the
   operator DNA. Upon induction, proteases in the bacterial host cleave the C1
   dimerization  domain  from  the  DNA-binding  domain, so that genes for the
   lytic pathway are no longer repressed.
 - PBSX xre, a repressor protein of the defective prophage in Bacillus.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  sinR,  a  transcriptional  repressor  for inhibition of
   sporulation.  The  structure  and  function are related to phage repressors
   [3].
 - Bombyx   mori   (Silk   moth)  MBF1,  multiprotein  bridging  factor  1,  a
   transcriptional  coactivator  that  mediates  transcriptional activation by
   connecting  a  general  and  a  gene-specific transcription factor. MBF1 is
   conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human [4,5].
 - Plasmid  pIP501 copR, a transcriptional repressor and activator involved in
   plasmid copy number regulation.
 - Escherichia   coli   nadR,   a   transcriptional  regulator  of  early  NAD
   biosynthetic genes.
 - Dictyostelium  discoideum  (Slime  mold)  H7, a vegetative specific protein
   which is deactivated upon the initiation of development.

The  profile we developed covers the entire DNA-binding domain, from the major
part  of  helix  1, including the helix-turn-helix motif and the major part of
helix 5.
