* GYF domain profile *
**********************

The  glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine  (GYF)  domain  is an around 60-amino acid
domain which  contains  a  conserved  GP[YF]xxxx[MV]xxWxxx[GN]YF motif. It was
identified in  the  human  intracellular  protein termed CD2 binding protein 2
(CD2BP2), which  binds  to a site containing two tandem PPPGHR segments within
the cytoplasmic  region  of  CD2.  Binding experiments and mutational analyses
have demonstrated  the  critical  importance  of  the GYF tripeptide in ligand
binding. A  GYF  domain  is also found in several other eukaryotic proteins of
unknown function  [1]. It has been proposed that the GYF domain found in these
proteins could also be involved in proline-rich sequence recognition [2].

Resolution of  the  structure  of  the  CD2BP2  GYF domain by NMR spectroscopy
revealed a compact domain with a beta-beta-alpha-beta-beta topology, where the
single alpha-helix  is  tilted away from the twisted, anti-parallel beta-sheet
(see <PDB:1GYF>). The conserved residues of the GYF domain create a contiguous
patch of  predominantly hydrophobic nature which forms an integral part of the
ligand-binding site [2]. There is limited homology within the C-terminal 20-30
amino acids  of various GYF domains, supporting the idea that this part of the
domain is structurally but not functionally important [3].

The profile we developed spans the entire GYF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
