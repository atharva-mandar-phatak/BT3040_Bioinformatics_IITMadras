* Alpha-carbonic anhydrases signature and profile *
***************************************************

Carbonic anhydrases  (EC 4.2.1.1) (CA) [1,2,3,4] are zinc metalloenzymes which
catalyze the  reversible  hydration  of  carbon dioxide, a reaction underlying
many diverse  physiological  processes in animals, plants, archaebacteria, and
eubacteria. Currently  there  are  five  evolutionarily  distinct  CA families
(alpha, beta,  gamma,  delta  and  epsilon)  that have no significant sequence
identity and   were   invented   independently.   The   alpha-CAs   are  found
predominantly in animals but also in bacteria and green algae [5,6,7].

To date 15 alpha-CA or alpha-CA-like proteins have been identified in mammals.
These can  be  divided  into  five  broad  subgroups: the cytosolic CAs (CA-I,
CA-II, CA-III,  CA-VII  and  CA  XIII),  mitochondrial  CAs (CA-VA and CA-VB),
secreted CAs  (CA-VI),  membrane-associated  (CA-IV, CA-IX, CA-XII and CA-XIV)
and those  without CA activity, the CA-related proteins (CA-RP VIII, X and XI)
[6].

In the  alga  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii,  two CA isozymes have been sequenced
[8]. They are periplasmic glycoproteins evolutionary related to mammalian CAs.
Some bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae [9] also have an alpha-type CA.

The dominating secondary structure is a 10-stranded, twisted beta-sheet, which
divides the  molecules  into two halves (see <PDB:1RAZ>). Except for two pairs
of parallel  strands,  the  beta sheet is antiparallel. A few relatively short
helices are  located  on the surface of the molecule [10]. Alpha-CAs contain a
single zinc   atom   bound   to   three   conserved  histidine  residues.  The
catalytically active  group  is  the  zinc-bound  water  which  ionizes  to  a
hydroxide group.  In the mechanism of catalysis, nucleophilic attack of CO2 by
a zinc-bound  hydroxide ion is followed by displacement of the resulting zinc-
bound bicarbonate    ion  by  water;  subsequent deprotonation regenerates the
nucleophilic zinc-bound hydroxide ion [5,11].

Protein D8 from Vaccinia and  other poxviruses  is related to CAs but has lost
two of  the  zinc-binding  histidines  as  well  as  many  otherwise conserved
residues. This  is  also  true  of  the  N-terminal  extracellular  domain  of
some receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases (see <PDOC00323>).

We derived  a  signature  pattern  for the alpha-CAs which includes one of the
zinc-binding histidines.  We  also  developed a profile that covers the entire
alpha-CA catalytic domain.

-Consensus pattern: S-E-[HN]-x-[LIVM]-x(4)-[FYH]-x(2)-E-[LIVMGA]-H-[LIVMFA](2)
                    [The second H is a zinc ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL   active
 CAs.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Most  prokaryotic  CAs  as  well  as  plant  chloroplast  CAs belong to
 another, evolutionary  distinct  family  of  proteins,  the  beta-family (see
 <PDOC00586>).
