* Chorismate mutase domains profiles *
**************************************

Chorismate  mutase  (CM)  is  a  regulatory  enzyme (EC 5.4.99.5) required for
biosynthesis  of  the  aromatic  amino  acids  phenylalanine  and tyrosine. CM
catalyzes  the  Claisen  rearrangement  of chorismate to prephenate, which can
subsequently  be  converted  to  precursors  of  either  L-Phe  or  L-Tyr.  In
bifunctional  enzymes  the  CM domain can be fused to a prephenate dehydratase
(P-protein   for   Phe  biosynthesis),  (see  <PDOC00671>),  to  a  prephenate
dehydrogenase     (T-protein,     for     Tyr     biosynthesis),     or     to
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate  (DAHP)  synthase  (EC  2.5.1.54).
Besides  these  prokaryotic  bifunctional enzymes, monofunctional CMs occur in
prokaryotes as well as in fungi, plants and nematode worms [1].

The  type  I  or  AroH class of CM is represented by Bacillus subtilis aroH, a
monofunctional,   nonallosteric,  homotrimeric  enzyme  characterized  by  its
pseudo-alpha/beta-barrel  3D  structure.  Each monomer folds into a 5-stranded
mixed  beta-sheet packed against an alpha-helix and a 3[10] helix. The core is
formed  by  a  closed  barrel  of mixed beta-sheets surrounded by helices (see
<PDB:2CHS>).  The  interfaces  between adjacent subunits form three equivalent
clefts that harbor the active sites [2].

The  type  II  or  AroQ  class of CM has a completely different all-helical 3D
structure,  represented  by the CM domain of the bifunctional Escherichia coli
P-protein  (see  <PDB:1ECM>).  This  type  is  named  after  the  Enterobacter
agglomerans  monofunctional  CM  encoded  by the aroQ gene [3]. All CM domains
from  bifunctional  enzymes  as well as most monofunctional CMs belong to this
class, including archaeal CM.

Eukaryotic  CM  from  plants  and  fungi  form  a  separate  subclass of AroQ,
represented  by  the  Baker's  yeast  allosteric  CM.  These enzymes show only
partial  sequence  similarity  to  the  prokaryotic  CMs  due to insertions of
regulatory  domains,  but the helix-bundle topology and catalytic residues are
conserved  and  the  3D structure of the E. coli CM dimer resembles a yeast CM
monomer  (see <PDB:1CSM>) [1,4,5]. The E. coli P-protein CM domain consists of
3  helices  and  lacks allosteric regulation. The yeast CM has evolved by gene
duplication  and  dimerization  and  each  monomer has 12 helices. Yeast CM is
allosterically activated by Trp and inhibited by Tyr [4].

Some proteins known to contain a chorismate mutase domain:

 - Bacillus   subtilis   CM   encoded  by  the  aroH  gene,  a  monofunctional
   homotrimeric  enzyme  that  is  not affected by end-product amino acids and
   effectors.
 - Bacterial  P-protein,  a  bifunctional  enzyme  composed  of  two catalytic
   domains,  CM  and  prephenate dehydratase for biosynthesis of phenylalanine
   (Phe). A C-terminal domain can be involved in feedback inhibition by Phe.
 - Bacterial T-protein, a bifunctional enzyme of two catalytic domains, CM and
   prephenate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.12) for biosynthesis of tyrosine (Tyr).
   Both enzyme activities are inhibited by Tyr.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  aroA(G)  protein, a bifunctional enzyme composed of two
   catalytic domains, CM and DAHP synthase.
 - Enterobacter  agglomerans  CM  encoded  by  the aroQ gene, a monofunctional
   chorismate mutase.
 - Yeast  CM,  a monofunctional CM that is allosterically inhibited by Tyr and
   Phe  and  activated  by  tryptophan,  the  product  from a competing enzyme
   complex at the branch point of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis [1,4].
 - Plant  CM, which often occur with different isoenzymes that are differently
   regulated.

We  developed  a  profile for each structural type of CM domain. Each of the 3
profiles covers the corresponding chorismate mutase domain entirely.
