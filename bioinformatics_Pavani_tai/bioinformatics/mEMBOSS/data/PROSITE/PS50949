* GntR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  gntR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about  60-70 residues present in transcriptional regulators of the
gntR  family.  This  family  of  bacterial  regulators is named after Bacillus
subtilis gntR, a repressor of the gluconate operon [1,2]. Six subfamilies have
been  described  for  the gntR family: fadR, hutC, plmA, mocR, ytrA, and araR,
which  regulate various biological processes and important bacterial metabolic
pathways.   The  DNA-binding  gntR-type  HTH  domain  occurs  usually  in  the
N-terminal   part.  The  C-terminal  part  can  contain  a  subfamily-specific
effector-binding  domain  and/or  an  oligomerization  domain.  The  fadR-like
regulators, representing the largest subfamily, are involved in the regulation
of  oxidized  substrates  related to metabolic pathways or metabolism of amino
acids.  HutC-like  proteins  are  involved  in conjugative plasmid transfer in
several  Streptomyces  species.  PlmA is a cyanobacterial regulator of plasmid
maintenance.  The  mocR  subfamily  encompasses proteins homologous to class I
aminotransferase  proteins, which bind pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. Most
of  the  ytrA-like  proteins  take  part  in  operons  involved in ATP-binding
cassette  (ABC)  transport  systems.  AraR is an autoregulatory protein with a
C-terminal  domain that binds a carbohydrate effector, similar to that present
in regulators of the lacI/galR family (see <PDOC00366>) [3,4].

The  crystal  structures  of fadR show that the N-terminal, DNA binding domain
contains  a  small  beta-sheet  (B)  core  and  three alpha-helices (H) with a
topology  H1-B1-H2-H3-B2-B3 (see <PDB:1H9T>). Helices 2 and 3, connected via a
tight   turn,   comprise   the   helix-turn-helix   motif.  The  anti-parallel
beta-strands 2 and 3 together with B1 form a small beta-sheet, which is called
the  wing.  Helix  3 is termed the recognition helix as in most wHTHs it binds
the  DNA  major groove. Here, only the N-terminal tip of the recognition helix
makes  specific  DNA-contacts  and  the  wing  makes unusual sequence-specific
contacts  to  the  minor  groove.  Like  other  HTH  proteins,  most gntR-type
regulators  bind as homodimers to 2-fold symmetric DNA sequences in which each
monomer recognizes half of the site [5,6].

Some proteins known to contain a gntR-type HTH domain:

 - Bacillus subtilis gntR, a repressor of the gnt operon, which is responsible
   for  gluconate  metabolism.  In the absence of gluconate, gntR binds to the
   promoter  of  the  operon.  The  expression of the operon is induced in the
   presence of gluconate.
 - Escherichia   coli   fadR,   a  transcriptional  regulator  of  fatty  acid
   metabolism.  In  the  absence of the acyl-CoA effector, fadR binds specific
   operator  sites,  represses  the expression of genes involved in fatty acid
   degradation  and  import,  and  activates  biosynthetic  genes.  Binding of
   acyl-CoA   gives  conformational  changes  abolishing  DNA  binding,  which
   derepresses the catabolic genes and deactivates the anabolic genes.
 - Escherichia   coli  phdR,  a  transcriptional  repressor  of  the  pyruvate
   dehydrogenase complex.
 - Klebsiella   aerogenes  and  Pseudomonas  putida  hutC,  a  transcriptional
   repressor of the histidine utilization (hut) operon.
 - Streptomyces  lividans korA, a  regulator that controls plasmid transfer.
 - Rhizobium meliloti mocR, a probable regulator of rhizopine catabolism.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  ytrA,  a  repressor  of  the  acetoine utilization gene
   cluster.
 - Anabaena  sp.  strain  PCC  7120  plmA,  a  regulator  involved  in plasmid
   maintenance [4].
 - Bacillus  subtilis  araR,  a  transcriptional  repressor  of  the arabinose
   operon.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the entire gntR-type HTH domain, from the
well-conserved part of helix 1 to the end of the wing.
