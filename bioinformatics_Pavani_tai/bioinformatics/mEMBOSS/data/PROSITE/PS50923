* Sushi/CCP/SCR domain profile *
********************************

The  extracellular  sushi  domain  is  characterized  by  a consensus sequence
spanning  ~60 residues containing four invariant cysteine residues forming two
disulfide-bridges  (I-III  and  II-IV),  a  highly  conserved  tryptophan, and
conserved  glycine,  proline,  and hydrophobic residues [1]. Sushi domains are
known  to  be involved in many recognition processes, including the binding of
several  complement  factors to fragments C3b and C4b [1]. The sushi domain is
also  known  as  the  complement  controle  protein  (CCP) module or the short
consensus repeat (SCR).

Several  structure  of  the  sushi  domain  have  been solved (see for example
<PDB:1HCC>)  [2].  The sushi domain folds into a small and compact hydrophobic
core  enveloped  by  six beta-strands and stabilized by two disulfide bridges.
The relative structural orientation of the Beta-2 and Beta-4 strands is shared
by  all  the  sushi  structures,  whereas  the  topology  of the other strands
relative to this central conserved core is variable, especially at the regions
that form the interfaces with the preceding and following domains [3].

Some proteins known to contain a sushi domain:

 - Mammalian  complement  receptor type 1 and 2. They mediate cellular binding
   of particles and immune complexes that have activated complement.
 - Mammalian  C4b-binding  protein  alpha  chain.  It  binds  as a cofactor to
   C3b/C4b inactivator, which then hydrolyzes the complement fragment C4b.
 - Mammalian  complement  factor  H-related protein 2. It might be involved in
   complement regulation.
 - Mammalian  membrane  cofactor  protein (MCP), an important membrane protein
   for protecting host cells from damage by complement. MCP possesses cofactor
   activity for inactivation of C3b and C4b by serum factor I.
 - Mammalian   complement   decay-accelerating   factor  (DAF).  This  protein
   recognizes  C4b  and C3b fragments that condense with cell-surface hydroxyl
   or  amino  groups  when nascent C4b and C3b are locally generated during C4
   and  C3  activation.  Interaction  of  DAF with cell-associated C4b and C3b
   polypeptides interferes with their ability to catalyze the conversion of C2
   and  factor  B  to enzymatically active C2a and Bb and thereby prevents the
   formation  of  C4b2a  and  C3bBb,  the  amplification  convertases  of  the
   complement cascade.
 - Mammalian  beta-2-glycoprotein  I  or apolipoprotein H. It binds to various
   kinds  of negatively charged substances such as heparin, phospholipids, and
   dextran   sulfate.  It  may  prevent  activation  of  the  intrinsic  blood
   coagulation  cascade  by binding to phospholipids on the surface of damaged
   cells.
 - Mammalian  P-selectin,  a  Ca(2+)-dependent receptor for myeloid cells that
   binds  to  carbohydrates  on  neutrophils  and  monocytes.  It mediates the
   interaction of activated endothelial cells or platelets with leukocytes.
 - Mammalian  neurocan  core  protein.  It  may modulate neuronal adhesion and
   neurite  growth  during  development  by  binding  to  neural cell adhesion
   molecules  (NG-CAM  and  N-CAM).
 - Mammalian  complement  C2.  It  is  part  of  the  classical pathway of the
   complement system. It is cleaved by activated factor C1 into two fragments:
   C2b  and  C2a. C2a, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor
   4b to generate the C3 or C5 convertase.
 - Mammalian  mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2. A trypsin protease that
   presumably plays an important role in the initiation of the mannose-binding
   lectin  (MBL) complement activation pathway. After activation it cleaves C4
   generating C4a and C4b.
 - Mammalian  thyroid  peroxidase,  a  key  enzyme  in  the process of thyroid
   hormone synthesis.
 - Mammalian  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  type  B  receptor,  subunit  1 (GABA-B
   receptor 1).
 - Mammalian  haptoglobin. It combines with free plasma hemoglobin, preventing
   loss  of iron through the kidneys and protecting the kidneys from damage by
   hemoglobin, while making the hemoglobin accessible to degradative enzymes.
 - Drosophila locomotion-related protein Hikaru genki.
 - Viral  complement  control  protein. It serves to protect the virus against
   complement  attack by inhibiting both classical and alternative pathways of
   complement activation. It binds C3b and C4b.
