* Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase 24 Kd subunit signature *
****************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located in  the  inner mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there is  one  with  a  molecular  weight  of  24  Kd (in mammals), which is a
component of  the  iron-sulfur (IP) fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind a
2Fe-2S iron-sulfur  cluster.  The  24  Kd  subunit  is  nuclear  encoded, as a
precursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and in Neurospora crassa.

The 24 Kd subunit is highly similar to [3,4]:

 - Subunit E of Escherichia coli NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoE).
 - Subunit NQO2 of Paracoccus denitrificans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.

As as signature pattern we selected a highly  conserved region, located in the
central section  of  this  subunit  and which contains two conserved cysteines
that are probably involved in the binding of the 2Fe-2S center.

-Consensus pattern: [DKG]-x(2)-[FLV]-[STKD]-x(5)-C-[LMNQ]-[GA]-x-C-x(2)-[GA]-P
                    [The 2 C's may be 2Fe-2S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
