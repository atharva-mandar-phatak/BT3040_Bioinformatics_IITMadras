* DM10 domain profile *
***********************

DM10 domains  contain  ~105  residues  and  are  of  unknown function. In both
Chlamydomonas and mammals, this module has to date been identified in only two
types of  proteins.  The  first is the nm23-H7 class of nucleoside diphosphate
kinase (NDK7)  that  consists  of an N-terminal DM10 domain and two functional
catalytic NDK  modules  (see  <PDOC00409>).  In  Chlamydomonas,  this  protein
(termed p40  is  tightly  associated  with  the  flagellar axoneme. The second
family of  proteins  containing  DM10  domains is exemplified by Chlamydomonas
Rib72, which  consists of three repeated DM10 regions followed by a C-terminal
domain containing  two  EF-hands  that  are  predicted  to  bind  Ca(2+)  (see
<PDOC00018>). The domain structure of mammalian Efhc1 is essentially identical
to that of Chlamydomonas Rib72. Orthologous proteins are present in many other
organisms that  contain  motile cilia including mouse, rat, Ciona, sea urchin,
Leishmania, and  trypanosomes.  However,  no  obvious Rib72/Efhc1 relative has
been identified  in  higher  plants,  or in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome,
which encodes  only  one  DM10 domain-containing protein. In Chlamydomonas and
likely also  mammals,  DM10 domain-containing protein are tightly bound to the
flagellar doublet  microtubules.  This suggests that DM10 domains might act as
flagellar NDK regulatory modules or as units specifically involved in axonemal
targeting or assembly [1].

DM10 domains  are  predicted  to  have  the  same  organization  of  secondary
structural elements;  this  includes  seven  beta  strands,  with  a short 3-4
residue helix after the first strand, and a more extended alpha helical region
at the C-terminus [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire DM10 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 2007 / First entry.
