* Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase signature *
***********************************************

Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.5) is a FMN  flavoprotein involved
in the de novo synthesis  of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and  pyridoxal phosphate.
It oxidizes  pyridoxamine-5-P (PMP) and pyridoxine-5-P (PNP) to pyridoxal-5-P.
The sequences of the enzyme from bacterial (genes pdxH or fprA) [1] and fungal
(gene PDX3)  [2]  sources  show  that  this  protein has been highly conserved
throughout evolution.

PdxH is  evolutionary  related  [3]  to  one  of  the enzymes in the phenazine
biosynthesis protein pathway, phzD (also known as phzG).

As a  signature  pattern, we selected a highly conserved region located in the
C-terminal part of these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVFMYWA]-E-F-W-[QHGENRAMVYLCF]-x(4)-[RW]-[LIVMK]-[HN]-
                    [DNESIT]-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
