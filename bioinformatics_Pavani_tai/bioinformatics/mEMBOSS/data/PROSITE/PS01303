*****************************************
* BCCT family of transporters signature *
*****************************************

The following prokaryotic transport proteins are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Escherichia coli high-affinity choline transport protein betT.
 - Escherichia coli carnitine transport protein caiT.
 - Bacillis subtilis glycine betaine transporter opuD.
 - Corynebacterium glutamicum glycine betaine transporter betP.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeaV.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1706.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY21C12.11.

These transport  proteins  belong  to  a  family  known as BCCT (for Betaine /
Carnitine /  Choline Transporters) which are specific for compounds containing
a quaternary  nitrogen  atom. These proteins contains 12 transmembrane regions
and are  energized  by proton symport. They contains a concerved region with 4
tryptophans in  their  central  region.  We  use  this  region  as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [GSDNA]-W-T-[LIVM]-x-[FY]-W-x-W-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belongs  to  family  TC 2.33 in  the classification of
 transporters [2].

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
