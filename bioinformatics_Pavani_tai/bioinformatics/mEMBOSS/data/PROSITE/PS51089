* Headpiece (HP) domain profile *
*********************************

Headpiece  is  an ~70-residue F-actin-binding domain present at the C terminus
of  many  cytoskeletal proteins [1]. It was first discovered in the epithelial
brush  border  protein villin, a member of the gelsolin family, which consists
of six gelsolin repeats, followed by the C-terminal headpiece domain [2].

The  headpiece  domain  folds  in  a very compact globular structure organized
around  an extended hydrophobic core (see <PDB:1QQV>) [1]. It is composed of a
highly  alpha-helical C-terminal subdomain and an N-terminal subdomain made up
of  bends  and  turns  with  a  short  alpha-helix.  Most of the actin-binding
residues  identified  by biochemical studies are localized on a single face on
the surface of the domain [3].

Some of the proteins known to contain a headpiece domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic villin protein, a Ca(2+)-regulated actin-binding protein. Villin
   has been demonstrated to bundle and sever F-actin [4].
 - Drosophila villin-like protein quail.
 - Vertebrate dematin, an actin-bundling protein.
 - Animal actin-binding LIM (AbLIM) or limatin protein. It may act as scaffold
   protein and may play a role in axon guidance.
 - Vertebrate  advillin  protein.  It  may  function  in  the morphogenesis of
   neuronal cells which form ganglia.
 - Supervillin  protein.  It  forms  a  high-affinity  link  between the actin
   cytoskeleton and the membrane.

The profile we developed covers the whole headpiece domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
