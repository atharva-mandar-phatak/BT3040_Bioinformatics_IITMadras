* Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases signatures *
**************************************

Acyl-CoA  dehydrogenases [1,2,3] are enzymes  that catalyze  the   alpha,beta-
dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA esters and transfer electrons to ETF, the electron
transfer protein. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are FAD flavoproteins. This family
currently includes:

 - Five eukaryotic isozymes that catalyze the first step of the beta-oxidation
   cycles for fatty acids with various chain lengths.  These are  short (SCAD)
   (EC 1.3.99.2),  medium  (MCAD)  (EC  1.3.99.3), long (LCAD) (EC 1.3.99.13),
   very-long (VLCAD) and short/branched (SBCAD) chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases.
   These enzymes are located in the mitochondrion. They are all homotetrameric
   proteins of  about  400  amino acid residues except VLCAD  which is a dimer
   and which contains, in its mature form, about 600 residues.
 - Glutaryl-CoA  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.3.99.7) (GCDH), which is involved in the
   catabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan.
 - Isovaleryl-CoA   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.3.99.10)  (IVD),  involved  in  the
   catabolism of leucine.
 - Acyl-coA dehydrogenases acdA and mmgC from Bacillus subtilis.
 - Butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.2) from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
 - Escherichia coli protein caiA [4].
 - Escherichia coli protein aidB.

We have  selected  two  conserved  regions as signature patterns. The first is
located in the center of these enzymes, the second in the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [GAC]-[LIVM]-[ST]-E-x(2)-[GSAN]-G-[ST]-D-x(2)-[GSA]

                    [DEN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
