* LOB domain profile *
**********************

The LATERAL  ORGAN  BOUNDARIES  (LOB) gene is expressed at the adaxial base of
initiating lateral  organs  and  encodes  a  plant-specific protein of unknown
function. The  N-terminal  one  half  of  the LOB protein contains a conserved
approximately 100-amino  acid  domain  (the  LOB domain) that is present in 42
other Arabidopsis  proteins  and  in  proteins  from  a variety of other plant
species. Genes  encoding  LOB domain (LBD) proteins are expressed in a variety
of temporal-  and  tissue-specific patterns, suggesting that they may function
in diverse processes [1].

The LOB  domain contains conserved blocks of amino acids that identify the LBD
gene family. In particular, a conserved C-x(2)-C-x(6)-C-x(3)-C motif, which is
defining feature  of  the  LOB  domain,  is present in all LBD proteins. It is
possible that this motif forms a new zinc finger [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire LOB domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
