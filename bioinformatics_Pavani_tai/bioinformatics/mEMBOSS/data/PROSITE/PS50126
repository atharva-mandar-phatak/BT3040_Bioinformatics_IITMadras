* S1 domain profiles *
**********************

The  S1  domain  of  around 70 amino acids, originally identified in ribosomal
protein S1, is found in a large number of RNA-associated proteins. It has been
shown  that  S1 proteins bind RNA through their S1 domains with some degree of
sequence specificity [1,2].

The  solution  structure  of  one  S1 RNA-binding domain from Escherichia coli
polynucleotide  phosphorylase  has  been  determined  [3].  It  displays  some
similarity  with  the  cold  shock domain (CSD) (see <PDOC00304>). Both the S1
and the CSD domain consist of an antiparallel beta barrel of the same topology
with  5  beta  strands.  This  fold  is  also shared by many other proteins of
unrelated  function  and  is known as the OB fold [4]. However, the S1 and CSD
fold  can  be distinguished from the other OB folds by the presence of a short
3(10)  helix  at  the end of strand 3. This unique feature is likely to form a
part of the DNA/RNA-binding site [3].

Some of the proteins in which an S1 domain is found are listed below.

 - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2alpha.
 - Yeast  protein  PRP22. A RNA helicase required for the release of mRNA from
   the spliceosome.
 - Archaeal and eukaryotic DNA dependent RNA polymerase II subunit 5.
 - Eukaryotic  rRNA biogenesis protein RRP5. Required for the formation of 18S
   and 5,8S rRNA.
 - Eukaryotic  dead box protein 8.  Facilitates nuclear export of spliced mRNA
   by releasing the RNA from the spliceosome.
 - Bacterial and chloroplastic translation initiation factor 1 (IF-1).
 - Bacterial  and  chloroplastic  S1  protein.  Plays  an  essential  role  in
   facilitating the   initiation  of  translation  by  interacting  with  both
   ribosome and  with  sequences  in  mRNA  upstream from the ribosome-binding
   site.
 - Bacterial   N-utilization   substance   protein  A  homolog  (nusA).  Could
   participates in both the termination and antitermination of transcription.
 - Bacterial  Ribonuclease E. Matures 5S rRNA from its precursors from all the
   rRNA genes. It also cleaves RNA I, a molecule that controls the replication
   of Cole1  plasmid  DNA.  It  is the major endoribonuclease participating in
   mRNA turnover.
 - Bacterial  ribonuclease G. Involved in processing of the 5'end of 16S rRNA.
   Could also be involved in chromosome segregation and cell division.
 - Bacterial  exoribonuclease  II. Acts on single-stranded polyribonucleotides
   processively in the 3' to 5' direction.
 - Bacterial ribonuclease R.
 - Bacterial  polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Exonuclease that degrades
   mRNA in  a  3'-to-5'  direction,  contains  an  S1  motif at the C-terminus
   immediately after a KH domain.

To identify S1 domains we developed 2 profiles, one is specific for bacterial,
chloroplastic and  eukaryotic  IF-1 proteins. The other recognize all other S1
domains. Both profiles cover the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the S1 profile: ALL
 except 1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the S1 IF-1 profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
