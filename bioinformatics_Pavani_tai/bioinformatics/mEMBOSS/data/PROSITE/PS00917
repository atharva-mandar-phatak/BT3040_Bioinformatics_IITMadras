******************************************************

Asparaginase   (EC 3.5.1.1),   glutaminase   (EC 3.5.1.2)   and   glutaminase-
asparaginase (EC 3.5.1.38) are  aminohydrolases that catalyze the   hydrolysis
of asparagine (or glutamine) to aspartate (or glutamate) and ammonia [1].

Two conserved threonine  residues  have been shown [2,3] to  play  a catalytic
role. One of them is located  in the N-terminal  extremity while the second is
located  at  the  end  of  the  first  third  of  the sequence.  We  used both
conserved regions as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-{L}-T-G(2)-T-[IV]-[AGS]
                    [The second T is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 10.

-Consensus pattern: [GA]-x-[LIVM]-x(2)-H-G-T-D-T-[LIVM]
                    [The first T is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Plant  asparaginases and  mammalian glutaminases do  not belong to this
 family and are thus not detected by the above pattern.
