* Chaperonins TCP-1 signatures *
********************************

The TCP-1 protein [1,2] (Tailless Complex Polypeptide 1)  was first identified
in mice  where  it  is especially  abundant  in testis but present in all cell
types. It has  since  been  found  and  characterized  in many other mammalian
species, in Drosophila and in yeast.  TCP-1  is  a highly conserved protein of
about 60  Kd  (556  to 560 residues) which participates in a hetero-oligomeric
900 Kd  double-torus shaped particle [3] with 6 to 8 other different subunits.
These subunits,  the  chaperonin  containing  TCP-1 (CCT) subunit beta, gamma,
delta, epsilon,  zeta  and eta are evolutionary related to TCP-1 itself [4,5].
The CCT  is  known  to  act  as  a  molecular chaperone for tubulin, actin and
probably some other proteins.

The CCT subunits are highly related to archebacterial counterparts:

 - TF55 and TF56 [6], a molecular chaperone from Sulfolobus shibatae. TF55 has
   ATPase activity,  is  known  to  bind  unfolded  polypeptides  and  forms a
   oligomeric complex of two stacked nine-membered rings.
 - Thermosome  [7],  from Thermoplasma acidophilum. The thermosome is composed
   of two  subunits  (alpha  and  beta)  and also seems to be a chaperone with
   ATPase activity. It forms an oligomeric complex of eight-membered rings.

The TCP-1 family of proteins are weakly, but significantly [8], related to the
cpn60/groEL chaperonin family (see <PDOC00268>).

As signature patterns of this family of chaperonins,  we chose three conserved
regions located in the N-terminal domain.
