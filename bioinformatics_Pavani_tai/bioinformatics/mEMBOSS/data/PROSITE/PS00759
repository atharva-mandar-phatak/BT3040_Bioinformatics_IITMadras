The  following  enzymes  have   been   shown [1,2,3]  to be  evolutionary  and
functionally related:

 - In the biosynthetic pathway from glutamate to  arginine, the  removal of an
   acetyl group from  N2-acetylornithine can  be catalyzed  via  two  distinct
   enzymatic  strategies  depending on the organism.  In some  bacteria and in
   fungi, the   acetyl   group  is  transferred  on  glutamate  by   glutamate
   N-acetyltransferase   (EC 2.3.1.35)   while   in  enterobacteria   such  as
   Escherichia   coli,  it  is   hydrolyzed  by  acetylornithine   deacetylase
   (EC 3.5.1.16) (acetylornithinase) (AO)  (gene argE). AO  is  a  homodimeric
   cobalt-dependent  enzyme which  displays  broad  specificity and  can  also
   deacylates    substrates   such    as   acetylarginine,    acetylhistidine,
   acetylglutamate semialdehyde, etc.
 - Succinyldiaminopimelate desuccinylase (EC 3.5.1.18)  (SDAP)  (gene dapE) is
   the enzyme  which  catalyzes  the  fifth step in the biosynthesis of lysine
   from aspartate  semialdehyde: the hydrolysis of succinyl-diaminopimelate to
   diaminopimelate and succinate. SDAP  is an  enzyme that  requires cobalt or
   zinc as a cofactor.
 - Aminoacylase-1   [4]  (EC 3.5.1.14)   (N-acyl-l-amino-acid  amidohydrolase)
   (ACY1). ACY1  is a homodimeric zinc-binding mammalian enzyme that catalyzes
   the hydrolysis of N-alpha-acylated amino acids (except for aspartate).
 - Carboxypeptidase G2 (EC 3.4.17.11) (folate  hydrolase G2)  (gene cpg2) from
   Pseudomonas strain RS-16.  This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of  reduced
   and non-reduced  folates  to  pteroates  and glutamate. G2 is a homodimeric
   zinc-dependent enzyme.
 - Vacuolar carboxypeptidase S (EC 3.4.17.4) (yscS) from yeast (gene CPS1).
 - Peptidase  T  (EC  3.4.11.-) (gene pepT) (tripeptidase) from bacteria. This
   enzyme catalyzes a variety of tripeptides containing N-terminal methionine,
   leucine, or phenylalanine.
 - Xaa-His dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.3)  (carnosinase)  from  Lactobacillus (gene
   pepV) [5],  a  metalloenzyme  with  activity against beta-alanyl-dipeptides
   including carnosine (beta-alanyl-histidine).

These enzymes  share  a  few characteristics. They hydrolyse peptidic bonds in
substrates that share a common structure, they are dependent on cobalt or zinc
for their  activity  and  they are proteins of 40 Kd to 60 Kd with a number of
regions of sequence similarity.

As signature patterns for  these  proteins, we  selected  two of the conserved
regions. The  first  pattern  contains  a  conserved  histidine which could be
involved in  binding  metal  ions  and the second pattern contains a number of
conserved charged residues.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[GALMY]-[LIVMF]-{Q}-[GSA]-H-x-D-[TV]-[STAV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 9.

-Consensus pattern: [GSTAI]-[SANQCVIT]-D-x-K-[GSACN]-x(1,2)-[LIVMA]-x(2)-
                    [LIVMFY]-x(12,17)-[LIVM]-x-[LIVMF]-[LIVMSTAGC]-[LIVMFA]-
                    x(2)-[DNGM]-E-E-x(0,1)-[GSTNE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belong  to families M20A/M20B in the classification of
 peptidases [6,E1].
