* B9 domain profile *
*********************

B9 domain  containing  proteins  are  found  in  flagellar or cilia-containing
species. Although  its  function  is  unknown,  a cilia-specific role has been
suggested for the poorly characterized B9 domain [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain a B9 domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Meckel  syndrome  1  (MKS1) protein, which may be related to the
   ciliary basal body.
 - Mammalian protein B9D1 and B9D2.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans X-box promoter element regulated protein 7 (xbx-7).
   It corresponds to mammalian MKS1.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ciliary transition zone associate protein 1 (tza-1).
   It corresponds to mammalian B9D2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ciliary transition zone associate protein 2 (tza-2).
   It corresponds to mammalian B9D1.
 - Paramecium  tetraurelia  ICIS-1  (Involved  in Cilia Stability-1), the B9D2
   homolog.

The profile we developed covers the entire B9 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
