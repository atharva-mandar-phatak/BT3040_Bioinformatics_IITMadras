* Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [1,2] is a potent mitogen  for  cells of
mesenchymal  origin,  including  smooth  muscle  cells and glial  cells.  PDGF
consists of  two  different  but closely related chains (A and B chains) which
assemble  to form  disulfide  linked homo- or heterodimers (A-A, B-B, an A-B).
Alternate splicing of the A chain  transcript  can give rise to  two different
forms that differ only in their C-terminal extremity. The transforming protein
of simian sarcoma virus (SSV), encoded by the v-sis oncogene,  is derived from
the B chain of PDGF.

PDGF is  structurally  related  to a number of other growth factors which also
form disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers:

 - Vascular   endothelial   growth  factor  (VEGF),  also  known  as  vascular
   permeability factor  (VPF)  [3], a growth factor active in angiogenesis and
   endothelial cell growth. The genome of the orf poxvirus encodes an  homolog
   of VEGF [4].
 - Vascular  endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B), also active in angiogenesis
   and endothelial cell growth [5].
 - Vascular  endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-C), also active in angiogenesis
   and endothelial cell growth [6].
 - Placenta growth factor (PlGF) [7], which is also active in agiogenesis.

As a signature pattern for this family of growth factors, we selected a region
that include four of  the eight  cysteines conserved in the sequences of these
proteins. In  PDGF,  these  cysteines  are  known to be involved in intra- and
inter-chain disulfide  bonds  [8].  We also developed a profile that spans the
eight conserved cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: P-[PSR]-C-V-x(3)-R-C-[GSTA]-G-C-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
