* Clostridium cellulosome enzymes repeated domain signature *
*************************************************************

Gram-positive, thermophilic  anaerobes  such  as  Clostridium thermocellum  or
Clostridium cellulolyticum secretes a highly active and thermostable cellulase
complex (cellulosome) responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose
[1,2]. The cellulosome contains at least  30 polypeptides, the majority of the
enzymes are endoglucanases  (EC 3.2.1.4), but  there  are  also some xylanases
(EC 3.2.1.8), beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) and endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases
(EC 3.2.1.73).

Complete sequence data for many of these enzymes has been obtained. A majority
of these proteins contain a highly conserved region of about 65 to 70 residues
which is generally (but not always)  located  in  the C-terminus.  This region
contains a  duplicated  segment  of  24  amino acids.   The  function  of this
duplicated segment is not yet known, although it  has  been  suggested that it
could be involved in substrate-binding or in calcium-binding [3].

Currently this domain has been found in:

 - Endoglucanases A (celA), B (celB), D (celD), E (celE),  F (celF), G (celG),
   H (celH) and X (celX) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Endoglucanases  A  (celCCA),  C  (celCCC),  D  (celCCD),  F  (celCCF) and G
   (celCCG) from Clostridium cellulolyticum.
 - Endoglucanase B (engB) from Clostridium cellulovorans.
 - Xylanases Y (XynY) and Z (xynZ) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Endo-beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (licB) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Cellulose  integrating  protein  (cipA) from Clostridium thermocellum. CipA
   acts as  a  scaffolding  protein in the cellulosome. It promotes binding of
   cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes [4].

The pattern  we  developed  spans the first 20 positions of the 24 amino acids
segment.

-Consensus pattern: D-[LIVMFY]-[DNV]-x-[DNS]-x(2)-[LIVM]-[DN]-[SALM]-x-D-x(3)-
                    [LIVMF]-x-[RKS]-x-[LIVMF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.  In all
 cases that pattern is detected twice.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
