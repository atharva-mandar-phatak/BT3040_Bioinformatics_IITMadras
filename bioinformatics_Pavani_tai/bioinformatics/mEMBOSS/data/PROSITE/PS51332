* B12-binding and B12-binding N-terminal domain profiles *
**********************************************************

The  B12-binding  domain is mainly found in two families of enzymes present in
animals  and  prokaryotes,  which use vitamin B12 (cobalamin) as cofactor. The
B12-binding  domain  can  bind  two different forms of the cobalamin cofactor,
with  cobalt  bonded either to a methyl group or to 5'-deoxyadenosine. Methyl-
and  adenosylcobalamin  enzymes  perform  distinct  kinds  of reactions at the
cobalt-carbon  bond.  The  enzymes  that bind methylcobalamin carry out methyl
transfer  reactions. Enzymes that require adenosylcobalamin catalyze reactions
in  which  the  first  step  is  the  cleavage  of  adenosylcobalamin  to form
cob(II)alamin  and  the  5'-deoxyadenosyl  radical  and  thus  act  as radical
generators.  In both types of enzymes the B12-binding domain uses an histidine
to  bind the cobalt atom of cobalamin cofactors. This histidine is embedded in
a  DXHXXG  sequence,  the  most conserved primary sequence motif of the domain
[1,2,3].

The  structure  of  the B12-binding domain is characterised by a five-stranded
alpha/beta  (Rossmann) fold (see <PDB:1BMT>) [4]. In cobalamin the cobalt atom
can  be  either  free  (dmb-off)  or  bound  to dimethylbenzimidazole (dmb-on)
according    to    the    pH.   When   bound   to   the   B12-binding   domain
dimethylbenzimidazole  ligand  is replaced by the active histidine (His-on) of
the DXHXXG motif. The replacement of dimethylbenzimidazole by histidine allows
switching  between  the  catalytic  and  activation  cycles [5]. In methionine
synthase  the  cobalamin cofactor is sandwiched between the B12-binding domain
and  an ~90 residues N-terminal domain forming a helical bundle comprising two
pairs of antiparallel helices [4].

The B12-binding domain is found in the following enzymes:

 - Animal  and prokaryotic methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13). It catalyzes the
   transfer  of a methyl group from methyl-cobalamin to homocysteine, yielding
   enzyme-bound cob(I)alamin and methionine.
 - Animal  and  prokaryotic  methylmalonyl-CoA  mutase  (EC  5.4.99.2).  It is
   involved  in  the degradation of several amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids
   and cholesterol via propionyl-CoA to the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
 - Prokaryotic lysine 5,6-aminomutase (EC 5.4.3.4).
 - Prokaryotic glutamate mutase (EC 5.4.99.1).
 - Prokaryotic methyleneglutarate mutase (EC 5.4.99.4).
 - Prokaryotic isobutyryl-CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.13).

The  first  profile recognizes the whole B12-binding domain. The second one is
directed against the helical bundle found N-terminal to the B12-binding domain
of methionine synthase.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
