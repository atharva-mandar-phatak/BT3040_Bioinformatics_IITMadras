* Death effector domain (DED) profile *
***************************************

The apoptotic  signal  coming  from  ligand-induced  oligomerization  of death
receptors is  mediated  by a number of adaptor proteins containing specialized
interaction domains.  Besides  the  death effector domain (DED), this group is
formed by  the death domain (DD) (see <PDOC50017>) and the caspase recruitment
domain (CARD) (see <PDOC50209>).

The death  effector  domain  was first described in the FADD/Mort1 protein [1]
and later  shown  to  also  occur  in  several  other  proteins [2,3]. The DED
typically associates with other DED-containing proteins, forming either dimers
or trimers [2,3,4]. It has been predicted that the DED is related in structure
and sequence  to  both DD and CARD domains, which work in similar pathways and
show similar  interaction  properties [5]. Important members of the DED family
are:

 - FADD/MORT1 death adaptor protein.
 - Caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.-), upstream death protease, interacts with FADD.
 - Caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.-).
 - v-FLIP, FLICE(caspase)-inhibitors that occur in gamma herpesviruses and the
   poxvirus MCV, interact with FADD and/or Caspase-8.
 - c-FLIP,  cellular  FLICE-inhibitor  with inactive caspase domain, interacts
   with FADD and/or caspase-8.
 - PEA15, a brain-specific phosphoprotein of unknown function

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The profile covers the complete domain.
