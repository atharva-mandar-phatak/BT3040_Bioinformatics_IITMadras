* AP2/ERF domain profile *
**************************

Ethylene  is an endogenous plant hormone that influences many aspects of plant
growth  and  development.  Some  defense  related  genes  that  are induced by
ethylene were found to contain a cis-regulatory element known as the Ethylene-
Responsive  Element  (ERE)  [1].  Sequence  analysis  on  various  ERE regions
identified  a  short motif rich in G/C nucleotides, the GCC-box, essential for
the  response  to  ethylene.  This  short  motif  is recognized by a family of
transcrition factors, the ERE binding factors (ERF) [2,3].

ERF  proteins contain an about 60 amino acid region which is also found in the
APETALA2  (AP2)  protein, the AP2/ERF domain [4]. It has been shown in various
proteins  that  the AP2/ERF domain is necessary and sufficient to bind GCC-box
[5].

The  structure  of  the AP2/ERF domain in complex with the target DNA has been
solved  (see <PDB:1GCC>)  [6].  The  structure  resemble that of bacteriophage
integrases  and  the  methyl-CpG-binding  domain  (MBD)  (see  <PDOC50982>): a
three-stranded   beta-sheet  and  an  alpha  helice  almost  parallel  to  the
beta-sheet.  It  contacts  DNA  via  Arg and Trp residues located in the beta-
sheet.

Some proteins known to contain an AP2/ERF domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana ERF1 to 6.
 - Tobacco  ethylene-responsive  element-binding proteins (EREBPs), homologues
   of ERFs proteins.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  AP2 protein. It regulates meristeme identity, floral
   organ specification and seed coat development.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element (DRE) binding
   factor 1  (CBF1 or DREB1) and DREB2. They bind a GCC-box-like element found
   in  dehydratation  responsive  element.  Binding  to  this element mediates
   cold-inducible transcription.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  and  maize  abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive 4 (ABI4)
   proteins.  They  bind  to  a  GCC-box-like  element found in ABA-responsive
   genes.
 - Octadecanoid-derivative responsive catharenthus AP2-domain (ORCA2) protein.
   It  binds a GCC-box-like element in the jasmonate responsive element of Str
   promoter.
 - Tomato  Pto-interacting  proteins  4 to 6 (Pti4 to Pti6). Pti5 and 6 bind a
   GCC-box-like  element in regulatory regions of various pathogenesis-related
   (PR) genes.
 - Trichodesmium  erythraeum,  Tetrahymena  thermophila,  Enterobacteria phage
   RB49  and  bacteriophage  Felix 01 HNH endonucleases. HNH endonucleases are
   homing endonucleases that move extensively via lateral gene transfer [7].

The profile we developed covers the whole AP2/ERF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
