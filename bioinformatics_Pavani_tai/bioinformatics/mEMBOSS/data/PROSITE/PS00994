* Bacterial export FHIPEP family signature *
********************************************

A number  of  bacterial proteins seem to be involved in translocating specific
proteins across  the bacterial cell membrane by a distinct secretory mechanism
that does  not require the cleavage of a signal peptide. They are evolutionary
related and belong to a family [1,2,3] that currently consists of:

 - flhA  from  various  bacterial species, involved in the export of flagellar
   proteins.
 - hrpI   from   Erwinia   amylovora,   necessary   for  secreting  harpin,  a
   proteinaceous elecitor  of  the hypersensitive response (HR) in the host of
   this plant-pathogen.
 - hrpC2 from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, also involved in HR.
 - hrpI  from  Pseudomonas  syringae,  also involved in HR and probably in the
   secretion of harpin-Pss.
 - hrpO from Burkholderia solanacearum, also involved in HR.
 - invA from Salmonella typhimurium, which could be involved in  translocating
   the invE protein necessary for invading cells of the intestinal epithelium.
 - lcrD  from  Yersinia  enterocolitica and pestis, which could be involved in
   secreting the Yop virulence proteins.
 - mxiA  from Shigella flexneri, involved in secreting the Ipa invasins  which
   are necessary for penetration of intestinal epithelial cells.

These proteins have all about 700 amino-acid residues.  The N-terminal half is
highly conserved  and  seems  to  contain 6 to 8 transmembrane domains. The C-
terminal half  is  less  conserved  and  seemingly     devoid of transmembrane
domains. It  is  possible that these proteins serve as pores for the export of
specific proteins.  We call  this family FHIPEP, which stands for Flagella/Hr/
Invasion Proteins Export Pore.

As a  signature  pattern, we  selected  the  best  conserved  region: a highly
conserved hydrophilic domain between two transmembranes regions.

-Consensus pattern: R-[LIVM]-[GSAT]-E-V-[GSAR]-A-R-F-[STAIV]-L-D-[GSA]-[LM]-P-
                    G-K-Q-M-[GSA]-I-D-[GSA]-[DAE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
