* WAPL domain profile *
***********************

The WINGS  APART-LIKE  (WAPL)  protein  of  Drosophila  melanogaster regulates
heterochromatin structure. It is required to hold sister chromatids of meiotic
heterochromatin together  and  is  implicated  in both heterochromatin pairing
during female meiosis and the modulation of position-effect variegation (PEV).
Although the  high-sequence  conservation is limited to a third of the protein
sequence, a  WAPL homologue has been identified in mammals. Mammalian WAPL may
play a  significant  role  in  meiosis  as does the Drosophila one. Human WAPL
is overexpressed  in   invasive human cervical cancers and is often associated
with cervical carcinogenesis [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire WAPL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2007 / Profile revised.
