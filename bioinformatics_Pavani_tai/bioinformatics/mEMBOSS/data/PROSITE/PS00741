* Dbl homology (DH) domain signature and profile *
**************************************************

The Rho family GTPases Rho, Rac and CDC42 regulate a diverse array of cellular
processes. Like  all  members  of  the Ras superfamily, the Rho proteins cycle
between active   GTP-bound   and  inactive  GDP-bound  conformational  states.
Activation of  Rho  proteins,  through  release  of  bound  GDP and subsequent
binding of  GTP, is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in
the Dbl  family.  The  proteins  encoded  by members of the Dbl family share a
common domain of about 200 residues (designated the Dbl homology or DH domain)
that has  been  shown  to  encode  a GEF activity specific for a number of Rho
family members.  In  addition,  all  family  members  possess a second, shared
domain designated  the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (see <PDOC50003>). Trio
and its  homolog  UNC-73  are  unique  within  the Dbl family insomuch as they
encode two  distinct DH/PH domain modules. The PH domain is invariably located
immediately C-terminal to the DH domain and this invariant topography suggests
a functional interdependence between these two structural modules. Biochemical
data have  established  the  role  of  the  conserved  DH domain in Rho GTPase
interaction and   activation,  and  the  role  of  the  tandem  PH  domain  in
intracellular targeting and/or regulation of DH domain function. The DH domain
of Dbl  has been shown to mediate oligomerization that is mostly homophilic in
nature. In  addition  to  the  tandem  DH/PH  domains  Dbl family GEFs contain
diverse structural motifs like serine/threonine kinase (see <PDOC00100>), RBD,
PDZ (see <PDOC50106>), RGS (see <PDOC50132>), IQ (see <PDOC50096>), REM, Cdc25
RasGEF (see  <PDOC00594>),  CH  (see  <PDOC50021>), SH2 (see <PDOC50001>), SH3
(see <PDOC50002>), EF (see <PDOC00018>), spectrin or Ig [1,2,3,4].

The DH domain is composed of three structurally conserved regions separated by
more variable  regions.  It  does not share significant sequence homology with
other subtypes  of small G-protein GEF motifs such as the Cdc25 domain and the
Sec7 domain  (see  <PDOC50190>),  which specifically interact with Ras and ARF
family small  GTPases,  respectively,  nor  with other Rho protein interactive
motifs, indicating that the Dbl family proteins are evolutionarily unique. The
DH domain  is  composed  of 11 alpha helices that are folded into a flattened,
elongated alpha-helix  bundle  in  which  two  of the three conserved regions,
conserved region  1  (CR1)  and conserved region 3 (CR3), are exposed near the
center of  one  surface.  CR1 and CR3, together with a part of alpha-6 and the
DH/PH junction site, constitute the Rho GTPase interacting pocket [2,3,5].

Some proteins known to contain a DH domain are listed below:

 - Dbl (or mcf-2) oncogene from mammals.  Dbl is a GEF for a  ras-like protein
   known as G25K or CDC42Hs.
 - CDC24 from yeast. CDC24 is a GEF that acts on the ras-like protein CDC42 to
   regulate bud site assembly and mating pheromone signaling.
 - scd1  from fission yeast. It is a cell cycle regulatory protein with global
   homology to CDC24.
 - p140-RAS GEF (cdc25Mm) from mammals. This protein, a GEF for ras, possesses
   both a domain belonging to the CDC24 family  and one belonging to the CDC25
   family.
 - Break  cluster  region  (Bcr) oncogene from mammals. Bcr can form a chimera
   with the abl protein and then cause chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Bcr
   acts on p21-rac proteins.
 - Abr,  a  protein that shares strong sequence organization and identity with
   Bcr, but  lacks  the serine/threonine kinase domain that is found at the N-
   terminus of Bcr.
 - T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing protein 1 (Tiam1 protein). Acts
   as a GEF for rac1, CDC42, and to a lesser extent rhoA.
 - Oncogenes vav and vav2 from mammals.  The target  of these proteins are not
   yet known.
 - Oncogene ect2 from mouse. The target of this protein is not yet known.
