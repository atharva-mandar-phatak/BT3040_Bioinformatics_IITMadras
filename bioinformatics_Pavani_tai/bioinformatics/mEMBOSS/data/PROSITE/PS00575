* Myelin proteolipid protein signatures *
*****************************************

Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP or lipophilin) [1] is the major myelin protein
from the central nervous system (CNS).  It probably plays an important role in
the formation  or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin. In man
point mutations in PLP  are  the  cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD),
a neurologic disorder of myelin metabolism. In animals dismyelinating diseases
such as mouse 'jimpy' (jp),  rat md,  or dog 'shaking pup' are  also caused by
mutations in PLP.

PLP is  a  highly conserved [2] hydrophobic protein of 276 to 280 amino  acids
which seems to contain  four transmembrane   segments, two disulfide bonds and
which covalently binds lipids (at least six palmitate groups in mammals) [3].

PLP is highly related to M6, a neuronal membrane glycoprotein [4].

As signature  patterns  for these proteins, we selected two conserved regions.
The first pattern is located in the N-terminal region; at the extremity of the
first transmembrane region. The second pattern is located in the extracellular
loop between  the  last  two  transmembrane regions  and  contains  a cysteine
involved in a disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: G-[MV]-A-L-F-C-G-C-G-H
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-[ST]-x-[DE]-x(3)-[ST]-[FY]-x-L-[FY]-I-x(4)-G-A
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
