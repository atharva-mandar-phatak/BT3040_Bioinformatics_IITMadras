* Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) signature *
*****************************************************

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP)  (EC 4.1.1.49)  (PEPCK)  [1] catalyzes
the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate by decarboxylation of  oxaloacetate while
hydrolyzing ATP, a rate limiting step in  gluconeogenesis (the biosynthesis of
glucose).

The sequence of this enzyme has  been  obtained  from Escherichia coli, yeast,
and Trypanosoma brucei;   these three  sequences are evolutionary related  and
share many regions of similarity.  As a signature pattern we selected a highly
conserved region that contains four acidic  residues  and  which is located in
the central part of the enzyme.  The beginning of the pattern is located about
10 residues  to  the  C-terminus  of  an  ATP-binding  motif 'A' (P-loop) (see
<PDOC00017>) and is also part of the ATP-binding domain [2].

-Consensus pattern: L-I-G-D-D-E-H-x-W-x-[DEPKVNA]-x-[GVS]-[IV]-x-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Staphylococcus aureus PEPCK.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  (GTP)  (EC 4.1.1.32)  an enzyme that
 catalyzes the same reaction, but  using GTP instead of ATP, is not related to
 the above enzyme (see <PDOC00421>).

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
