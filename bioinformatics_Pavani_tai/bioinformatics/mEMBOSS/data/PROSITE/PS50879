* Ribonuclease H domain profile *
*********************************

Ribonuclease H  (RNase  H) (EC 3.1.26.4) recognizes and cleaves the RNA strand
of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes.

In  prokaryotes  RNase  H is  involved in removing the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids,
particularly  the primers of Okazaki fragments in lagging-strand DNA synthesis
[1].  An  additional  function  of the bacterial RNase H domain is to generate
primers for initiation of DNA replication [2].

The  RNase  H  domain  is  also  present  in  retroviral reverse transcriptase
proteins  where  it  performs three functions : (a) generation of a polypurine
tract  which  acts as the primer for plus strand DNA synthesis, (b) removal of
RNA  primers  from  nascent minus and plus DNA strands, and (c) degradation of
the  original  RNA  template. For HIV, inactivation of the RNase H renders the
virus  non-infectious,  making this enzymatic activity a target for therapy of
AIDS [1].

In eukaryotes, the RNase H1 protein is present in nuclei, but it has also been
isolated  from  mitochondria  of  many organisms. In mouse inactivation of the
RNaseH1  gene  arrest  development  about  day  E8.5  because  of a failure to
generate  mtDNA,  indicating  an  essential role for RNase H1 during mammalian
embryogenesis [3].

The  3D structure of the RNase H domain from diverse bacteria and retroviruses
has  been  solved  (see  for  example  <PDB:1RNH>) [4,5,6]. All have four beta
strands  and four to five alpha helices. The Escherichia coli RNase H1 protein
binds  a  single  Mg(2+)  ion cofactor in  the  active site of the enzyme. The
divalent  cation  is  bound  by  the  carboxyl groups of four acidic residues,
Asp-10,  Glu-48,  Asp-70, and Asp-134 [5]. The first three acidic residues are
highly conserved in all bacterial and retroviral RNase H sequences.

The profile we developed covers the whole RNase H domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
