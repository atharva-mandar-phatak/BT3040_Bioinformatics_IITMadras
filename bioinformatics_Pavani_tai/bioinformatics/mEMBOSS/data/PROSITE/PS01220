* Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein family signature *
*************************************************************

Mammalian phosphatidylethanolamine-binding   protein  (also  knowns  as  basic
cytosolic 21  Kd  protein)  is  a  186  residue  protein found in a variety of
tissues [1].  It  binds hydrophobic ligands, such as phosphatidylethanolamine,
but also  seems  [2]  to bind nucleotides such as GTP and FMN, it is suggested
that it could act in membrane  remodeling  during growth and maturation.  This
protein belongs to a family that also includes:

 - Drosophila antennal protein A5, a putative odorant-binding protein.
 - Onchocerca volvulus antigen Ov-16 and the related proteins D1, D2 and D3.
 - Plasmodium falciparum putative phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein.
 - Toxocara  canis secreted antigen TES-26. This larval protein has been shown
   to bind phosphatidylethanolamine.
 - Yeast  protein  DKA1  (also  known  as  NSP1 or TFS1). The function of this
   protein is not very clear.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YLR179C.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F40A3.3.
 - Plants proteins of the 'CENTRORADIALIS'  and "SELF-PRUNING' family, some of
   which seem to be involved in the flowering process.

As a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region which is located
in the end of the first third of the sequence of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [FYL]-x-[LVM]-[LIVF]-x-[TIVM]-[DC]-P-D-x-P-[SNG]-x(10)-H
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
