* DOMON domain profile *
************************

The DOMON  domain  is an 110-125 residue long domain which has been identified
in the  physiologically  important  enzyme  dopamine beta-monooxygenase and in
several other  secreted  and  transmembrane  proteins  from  both  plants  and
animals. It  has  been  named  after  DOpamine  beta-MOnooxygenase  N-terminal
domain. The DOMON domain can be found in one to four copies and in association
with other  domains,  such as the Cu-ascorbate dependent monooxygenase domain,
the epidermal  growth  factor domain (see <PDOC00021>), the trypsin inhibitor-
like domain  (TIL),  the  SEA domain (see <PDOC50024>), and the Reelin domain.
The architectures  of the DOMON domain proteins strongly suggest a function in
extracellular adhesion [1,2].

The sequence   conservation   is  predominantly  centered  around  patches  of
hydrophobic residues.  The  secondary structure prediction of the DOMON domain
points to  an  all-beta-strand fold with seven or eight core strands supported
by a  buried core of conserved hydrophobic residues. There is a characteristic
motif with  two small positions (Gly or Ser) corresponding to a conserved turn
immediately C-terminal  to  strand  three. It has been proposed that the DOMON
domain might form a beta-sandwich structure, with the strands distributed into
two beta  sheets as is seen in many extracellular adhesion domains such as the
immunoglobulin, fibronectin  type-III,   cadherin  and  PKD  (see <PDOC50093>)
domains [1].

Some proteins known to contain a DOMON domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian   dopamine   beta-monooxygenase  (DM).  It  is  involved  in  the
   conversion of  dopamine  to  the  catecholamine  noradrenaline,  a  crucial
   physiological modulator  of the sympathetic nervous system, T-cell-mediated
   immunity and fetal development.
 - Drosophila  tyramine-beta-hydroxylase  (TBH),  an  orthologue  of DM. It is
   needed for   the  biosynthesis  of  the  neurotransmitter  octopamine  from
   tyramine.
 - Human brain protein C9orf4.
 - Mouse SDR2 protein.
 - Botryllus   schlosseri  PAR  protein,  a  soluble  immunoglobulin  molecule
   homologue.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans uncharacterized protein C09F9.2.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana uncharacterized protein At5g54830.

The profile we developed covers the entire DOMON domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
