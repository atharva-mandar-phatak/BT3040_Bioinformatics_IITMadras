* CVC domain profile *
**********************

Homeobox-containing genes  encode  transcription factors and are characterized
by the  homeodomain  (HD) (see <PDOC00027>), a motif that directs specific DNA
binding to regulate the expression of target genes. Homeobox genes are grouped
into several subclasses according to the primary structure of their HD and its
flanking sequences. Among the paired-like subclass, the paired-like CVC (PLC)-
homeodomain proteins  (HDPs)  are  characterized by a conserved CVC domain and
can be  grouped  into  the  Vsx-1  and Vsx-2 family, containing orthologs from
several species.  The  characteristic  feature  of  the  Vsx-1  group  are the
existence of  a  RV  domain  and LG sequence and the lack of a Paired-Tail/OAR
domain (see  <PDOC50803>).  Instead  of an RV domain, the Vsx-2 group proteins
have a  conserved  14  amino  acid motif called the Paired-Tail or OAR domain.
These specific   domain   differences   may   correlate  with  the  functional
specificity of  each  group.  PLC-HDPs  appear  to  play  a particular role in
occular development  and  execute  their functions by binding to the conserved
locus control  region  (LCR),  located upstream of the transcrption initiation
site of   the   red   opsin   gene,  and  thus  specify  the  development  and
differenciation of  cone  photoreceptors and a subset of retinal inner nuclear
layer bipolar  cells.  The  CVC  (standing  for Chx10/Vsx-1 and ceh-10) domain
consists of approximately 50-60 amino acid residues. Because the CVC domain is
located immediately C-terminal to the homeodomain, the CVC domain is predicted
to influence  transcriptional  regulation through DNA-binding, protein-protein
interaction and/or  protein degradation processes. It is possible that the CVC
domain is  necessary  for  protein  folding  or  protein-protein  interactions
because this domain is hydrophobic [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire CVC domain.
