* Enterobacterial virulence outer membrane protein signatures *
***************************************************************

A number  of enterobacterial outer  membrane  proteins  which  are involved in
virulence and seem to promote  the invasion of bacteria into  eukaryotic cells
have been  shown [1,2]  to be structurally related.  These proteins are listed
below.

 - Escherichia  coli  and  Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein X (gene
   ompX).
 - Salmonella typhimurium virulence membrane protein pagC.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica attachment invasion locus protein (gene ail).
 - Bacteriophage lambda outer membrane protein lom.  Lom  is  expressed during
   lysogeny in Escherichia coli.

These outer membrane  proteins  have from 150 to 170  amino  acid residues and
their sequences are well conserved.  We selected the two most highly conserved
regions as signature patterns. The  first pattern is located in the N-terminal
section of these proteins; the second is located at the C-terminal extremity.

-Consensus pattern: G-[LIVMFY]-N-[LIVM]-K-Y-R-Y-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [FYW]-x(2)-G-x-G-Y-[KR]-F>
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
