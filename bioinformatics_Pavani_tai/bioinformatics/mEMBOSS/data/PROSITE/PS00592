* Glycosyl hydrolases family 9 active sites signatures *
********************************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family E [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 9  [4,E1].  The  enzymes  which  are  currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens cellodextrinase 1 (ced1).
 - Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanases B (cenB) and C (cenC).
 - Clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanase G (celCCG).
 - Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanase C (engC).
 - Clostridium stercoararium endoglucanase Z (avicelase I) (celZ).
 - Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases D (celD), F (celF) and I (celI).
 - Fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase A (endA).
 - Pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase A (celA).
 - Streptomyces reticuli endoglucanase 1 (cel1).
 - Thermomonospora fusca endoglucanase E-4 (celD).

 - Dictyostelium discoideum  spore  germination  specific endoglucanase 270-6.
   This slime mold enzyme may digest the spore cell wall  during  germination,
   to release the enclosed amoeba.
 - Endoglucanases from plants such as Avocado or French bean.  In  plants this
   enzyme may be involved the fruit ripening process.

Two of the most conserved  regions in these enzymes  are centered on conserved
residues which have been shown [5,6], in the endoglucanase D from Cellulomonas
thermocellum, to be important  for the catalytic activity.  The  first  region
contains  an  active  site  histidine  and  the  second  region  contains  two
catalytically important residues: an aspartate and a glutamate.  We  have used
both regions as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: [STV]-x-[LIVMFY]-[STV]-x(2)-G-x-[NKR]-x(4)-[PLIVM]-H-x-R
                    [H is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Cellulomonas fimi cenC and Streptomyces reticuli cel1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Consensus pattern: [FYW]-x-D-x(4)-[FYW]-x(3)-E-x-[STA]-x(3)-N-[STA]
                    [D and E are active site residues]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Fibrobacter succinogenes endA whose sequence seems to be incorrect.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
