Beta-amylase (EC  3.2.1.2)  [1,2]  is  an  enzyme  that  hydrolyzes 1,4-alpha-
glucosidic linkages in starch-type polysaccharide substrates  so  as to remove
successive maltose units from the  non-reducing  ends  of  the  chains.  Beta-
amylase is present in certain bacteria as well as in plants.

Three highly  conserved sequence regions are found in all known beta-amylases.
The first of these regions is located in the N-terminal section of the enzymes
and contains an aspartate  which is known [3] to be involved in the catalytic
mechanism. The  second, located in a more central location, is centered around
a glutamate  which  is  also involved [4] in the catalytic mechanism.   We use
both regions as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-C-G-G-N-V-G-D
                    [D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: G-x-[SA]-G-E-[LIVM]-R-Y-P-S-Y
                    [E is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family 14  in  the  classification of glycosyl
 hydrolases [5,E1].
