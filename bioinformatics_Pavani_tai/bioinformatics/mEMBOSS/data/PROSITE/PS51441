****************************

Ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxydoreductase (FNR) (EC=1.18.1.2) transfers electrons from
ferredoxin (or  flavodoxin)  to  NADP(+) to generate NADPH. In eucaryotes, the
nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-targeted  enzyme  contains  two  domains: an FAD-
binding domain  (see  <PDOC51384>)  and  an  NADP(+)-binding  domain. With the
exception of  Gloeobacter  violaceous PCC 7421, the predicted sequences of all
cyanobacterial petH  genes,  encoding  FNR, correspond to a protein containing
three domains.  Two  domains  at  the  C-terminus  correspond  to the FAD- and
NADP(+)-binding domains  of  higher  plants  FNR  protein,  which  compose the
catalytic domains   of  the  enzyme.  The  N-terminal  domain  is  similar  to
phycobilisome (PBS)-associated  linker  proteins  from  numerous cyanobacteria
[1,2,3]:

 - cpcD,  the  phycocyanin (PC)-associated, rod-capping, linker polypeptide of
   PBS. The similarity spans nearly the entire sequence of this linker class.
 - cpcC,  the PC-associated rod linker polypeptide. The similarity is confined
   only to the C-terminus of this linker class.
 - apcC,  the  allophycocyanin  (APC)-associated, core linker polypeptide. The
   similarity only correspond to about half of the molecule.

The cpcD-like  domain  has an elongated shape and consists of a three-stranded
beta-sheet, two  alpha-helices,  one of which has only about one turn, and the
connecting random coil segments (see <PDB:1B33>) [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire cpcD-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
