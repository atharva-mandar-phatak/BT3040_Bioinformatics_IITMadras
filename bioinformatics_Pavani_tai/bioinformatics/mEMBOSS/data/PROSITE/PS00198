* 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur binding domain signature and profile *
***************************************************************************

Ferredoxins  [1]  are a group  of  iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron
transfer in  a  wide variety  of   metabolic  reactions.   Ferredoxins  can be
divided into several subgroups  depending upon the physiological nature of the
iron-sulfur  cluster(s).   One of these  subgroups are the 4Fe-4S ferredoxins,
which  are  found  in   bacteria  and  which   are thus  often    referred  as
'bacterial-type' ferredoxins.  The structure of these proteins [2] consists of
the duplication of a  domain of twenty six amino  acid residues; each of these
domains contains four cysteine residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center.

Several  structures  of the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
for  example <PDB:1FDN>) [3]. The clusters consist of two interleaved 4Fe- and
4S-tetrahedra  forming  a  cubane-like  structure, in such a way that the four
iron  occupy the eight corners of a distorted cube. Each 4Fe-4S is attached to
the polypeptide chain by four covalent Fe-S bonds involving cysteine residues.

A number  of  proteins  have  been found [4]  that  include one or more 4Fe-4S
binding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins
are  listed  below:

 - The iron-sulfur proteins  of  the succinate  dehydrogenase and the fumarate
   reductase  complexes (EC 1.3.99.1).  These  enzyme   complexes,  which  are
   components of the tricarboxylic  acid cycle, each contain three subunits: a
   flavoprotein,  an iron-sulfur protein,  and a b-type cytochrome.  The iron-
   sulfur proteins contain three  different  iron-sulfur  centers: a 2Fe-2S, a
   3Fe-3S  and a 4Fe-4S.
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5)
   This enzyme is composed of three subunits: A, B, and C. The C subunit seems
   to be an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-
   terminal part of the  protein.
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.  The  B subunit of
   this  enzyme  (gene dmsB)  is  an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  four  4Fe-4S
   ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Escherichia coli  formate  hydrogenlyase.  Two   of  the  subunits  of this
   oligomeric complex (genes hycB and hycF) seem  to  be  iron-sulfur proteins
   that each contain two 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Methanobacterium formicicum formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). This enzyme
   is used by the archaebacteria  to grow on formate.  The  beta chain of this
   dimeric enzyme probably binds two 4Fe-4S centers.
 - Escherichia  coli  formate  dehydrogenases  N  and O (EC 1.2.1.2). The beta
   chain  of these two enzymes (genes fdnH and fdoH) are  iron-sulfur proteins
   with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Desulfovibrio periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase (EC 1.18.99.1).  The large chain
   of this dimeric enzyme binds three 4Fe-4S centers, two of which are located
   in the ferredoxin-like N-terminal region of the protein.
 - Methanobacterium  thermoautrophicum  methyl  viologen-reducing  hydrogenase
   subunit mvhB, which contains six  tandemly repeated ferredoxin-like domains
   and which probably binds twelve 4Fe-4S centers.
 - Salmonella typhimurium anaerobic sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) [5]. Two of
   the subunits of  this enzyme (genes asrA and asrC) seem  to  both  bind two
   4Fe-4S centers.
 - A Ferredoxin-like protein  (gene fixX)  from  the  nitrogen-fixation  genes
   locus of various  Rhizobium  species,  and   one  from  the  Nif-region  of
   Azotobacter species.
 - The 9 Kd  polypeptide  of chloroplast photosystem I [6]  (gene psaC).  This
   protein contains two low potential 4Fe-4S centers, referred as  the A and B
   centers.
 - The chloroplast frxB protein which is predicted to carry two 4Fe-4S centers.
 - An ferredoxin  from a  primitive  eukaryote,  the enteric amoeba  Entamobea
   histolytica.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  yjjW, a protein with a N-terminal
   region belonging to the radical activating enzymes family (see <PDOC00834>)
   and two potential 4Fe-4S centers.

The  pattern  of  cysteine residues in the iron-sulfur region is sufficient to
detect  this class of 4Fe-4S binding proteins. The profile we developed covers
the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-{P}-C-x(2)-C-{CP}-x(2)-C-[PEG]
                    [The 4 C's are 4Fe-4S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
 of known 4Fe-4S sequences, with very few exceptions.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In some  bacterial  ferredoxins,  one of the two duplicated domains has
 lost one or  more of  the four conserved  cysteines.  The consequence of such
 variations is that these domains  have  either lost their iron-sulfur binding
 property or bind to a 3Fe-3S center instead of a 4Fe-4S center.
-Note: The last residue of this  pattern in most  proteins  belonging  to this
 group,  is a Pro; the  only  exceptions  are  the  Rhizobium  ferredoxin-like
 proteins which have Gly, and two Desulfovibrio ferredoxins which have Glu. It
 must also be noted that  the  three  non  4Fe-4S-binding  proteins  which are
 picked-up by the pattern have Gly in this position of the pattern.
