* Erythropoietin / thrombopoeitin signature *
*********************************************

Erythropoietin (EPO)  [1]  is the mammalian hormone involved in the regulation
of erythrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of a physiological level of
erythrocytes in  the  bloodstream. The mature form of EPO is a glycoprotein of
166 amino acid residues.

Thrombopoeitin (TPO)  [2]  is  the  mammalian  hormone  which  functions  as a
megakaryocytic lineage specific growth and differentiation factor. It acts as
a circulating  regulator  of  platelet  numbers.  The  mature form of TPO is a
glycoprotein of 330 amino acid residues.

EPO and  TPO  are  evolutionary related. As a signature pattern, we selected a
conserved region located at the N-terminal extremity of mature EPO and TPO and
that includes  two  cysteines  which  have  been  shown,  in  human EPO, to be
implicated in disulfide bonds.

-Consensus pattern: P-x(4)-C-D-x-R-[LIVM](2)-x-[KR]-x(14)-C
                    [The 2 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2004 / Text revised.
