******************************************************************

The major mutagenic and  carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in  DNA  is
the formation of O6-alkylguanine.  The repair  of  DNA containing O6-alkylated
guanine is carried out by the  enzyme 6-O-methylguanine-DNA  methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.63) (methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase) (MGMT). The
alkyl  group at the O-6 position is  transferred to a  cysteine residue in the
enzyme [1]. This is a suicide reaction: the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated
and  the  methylated protein  accumulates as a dead-end product. Most, but not
all MGMT are also  able to repair O-4-methylthymine.  MGMT sequences have been
obtained from various prokaryotic [2] and eukaryotic sources:

 - Escherichia coli and  Salmonella typhimurium inducible bifunctional protein
   ada.  The N-terminal part of the ada protein functions as a transcriptional
   activator of its own gene and of other alkylation repair genes,  while  the
   C-terminal part functions as a MGMT.
 - Bacillus subtilis adaB. In this bacteria the function of the ada complex is
   carried out by two proteins: adaA, a transcriptional activator, and adaB, a
   MGMT.
 - Escherichia coli constitutive (non-inducible) Ogt enzyme.
 - Bacillus subtilis constitutive (non-inducible) Dat1 enzyme.
 - Yeast DNA repair enzyme MGT1.
 - Mammalian MGMT protein [3].

In  all  these  enzymes  the region around the active site cysteine residue is
conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-P-C-H-R-[LIVMF](2)
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
