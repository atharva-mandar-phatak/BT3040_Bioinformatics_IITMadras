* Prokaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signatures *
********************************************************

A number of  different  prokaryotic  oxidoreductases  that require  and bind a
molybdopterin cofactor have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number of regions of
sequence similarity. These enzymes are:

 - Escherichia coli respiratory nitrate  reductase (EC 1.7.99.4).  This enzyme
   complex allows the bacteria  to  use nitrate as an electron acceptor during
   anaerobic growth.  The enzyme is composed of three different chains: alpha,
   beta  and gamma.  The alpha chain (gene narG)  is the molybdopterin-binding
   subunit.  Escherichia coli  encodes for  a second, closely related, nitrate
   reductase complex  which also contains a  molybdopterin-binding alpha chain
   (gene narZ).
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide  reductase  (DMSO reductase).
   DMSO reductase is the terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various
   sulfoxide  and N-oxide compounds.  DMSO  reductase  is  composed  of  three
   chains: A, B and C. The A chain (gene dmsA) binds molybdopterin.
 - Escherichia  coli  biotin  sulfoxide reductases (genes bisC and bisZ). This
   enzyme reduces  a  spontaneous  oxidation  product  of biotin, BDS, back to
   biotin. It  may  serve  as  a  scavenger,  allowing  the cell to use biotin
   sulfoxide as a biotin source.
 - Methanobacterium formicicum formate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2).  The alpha
   chain (gene fdhA) of this dimeric enzyme binds a molybdopterin cofactor.
 - Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenases -H (gene fdhF), -N (gene fdnG)  and
   -O (gene fdoG).  These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of formate
   to carbon  dioxide.  In  addition   to molybdopterin, the alpha (catalytic)
   subunit also contains an active site, selenocysteine.
 - Wolinella  succinogenes  polysulfide reductase  chain.   This  enzyme  is a
   component of the phosphorylative electron transport system with polysulfide
   as the  terminal acceptor. It is composed of three chains: A, B and C.  The
   A chain (gene psrA) binds molybdopterin.
 - Salmonella typhimurium thiosulfate reductase (gene phsA).
 - Escherichia coli trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase  (EC 1.6.6.9) (gene torA)
   [4].
 - Nitrate  reductase  (EC  1.7.99.4)  from Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene nasA),
   Alcaligenes eutrophus,    Escherichia    coli,   Rhodobacter   sphaeroides,
   Thiosphaera pantotropha  (gene  napA),  and  Synechococcus  PCC  7942 (gene
   narB).

These proteins range from 715 amino acids (fdhF) to 1246 amino acids (narZ) in
size.

We derived three signature patterns for these enzymes. The first is based on a
conserved region  in the N-terminal section and contains two cysteine residues
perhaps involved  in  binding  the molybdopterin cofactor. It should  be noted
that this region is not present in bisC.  The second pattern is derived from a
conserved region located in the central part of these enzymes.
