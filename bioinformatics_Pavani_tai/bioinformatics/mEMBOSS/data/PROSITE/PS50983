* Iron siderophore/cobalamin periplasmic-binding domain profile *
*****************************************************************

ATP binding  cassette  (ABC)  transporters are a ubiquitous family of importer
and exporter  proteins  that  consist  of two alpha-helical transmembrane (TM)
domains, which  form a translocation pathway, and two cytoplasmic ABC domains,
which power  the transport reaction through binding and hydrolysis of ATP (see
<PDOC00364>).  In addition  most  bacterial  importers  employs  a periplasmic
substrate-binding protein  (PBP) that delivers the ligand to the extracellular
gate of  the  TM domains. These proteins bind their substrates selectively and
with high  affinity,  which  is  thought  to  ensure  the  specificity  of the
transport reaction.  Binding  proteins  in  Gram-negative bacteria are present
within the  periplasm, whereas those in Gram-positive bacteria are tethered to
the cell  membrane via the acylation of a cysteine residue that is an integral
component of  a  lipoprotein  signal sequence. The cobalamin (vitamin B12) and
the iron  transport  systems share many common attributes and probably evolved
from the same origin [1,2,3,4].

The structure of the periplasmic-binding domain is composed of two subdomains,
each consisting  of a central beta-sheet and surrounding alpha-helices, linked
by a rigid alpha-helix (see <PDB:1N4A>). The substrate binding site is located
in a cleft between the two alpha/beta subdomains [5].

Some protein  known  to  contain  an  iron  siderophore/cobalamin periplasmic-
binding domain are listed below:

 - Escherichia  coli vitamin B12 transport protein btuF. It is the periplasmic
   binding protein for the vitamin B12 transporter btuCD.
 - Escherichia  coli  ferrichrome-binding periplasmic protein (fhuD). It binds
   iron(III)-hydroxamates.
 - Staphylococcus aureus ferric hydroxamate receptor 2 (fhuD2).
 - Escherichia  coli  ferrienterobactin-binding  periplasmic  protein fepB. It
   binds ferrienterobactin;  part  of  the binding-protein-dependent transport
   system for uptake of ferrienterobactin.
 - Vibrio cholerae periplasmic binding protein (viuP).
 - Escherichia coli iron(III) dicitrate-binding periplasmic protein (fecB). It
   binds citrate-dependent  iron(III);  part  of the binding-protein-dependent
   transport system for uptake of citrate-dependent iron(III).
 - Erwinia  chrysanthemi  achromobactin-binding periplasmic protein (cbrA). It
   binds citrate-or chloride-dependent iron(III); part of the binding-protein-
   dependent transport   system   cbrABCD   for   uptake  of  the  siderophore
   achromobactin.
 - Yersinia pestis hemin-binding periplasmic protein (hmuT).

The profile   we   developed  covers  the  entire  iron  siderophore/cobalamin
periplasmic-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
