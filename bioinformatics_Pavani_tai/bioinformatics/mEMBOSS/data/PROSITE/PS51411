* PSP1 C-terminal domain profile *
**********************************

The yeast   polymerase   suppressor  1  (PSP1)  protein  partially  suppresses
mutations in  DNA polymerases alpha and delta [1]. The C-terminal half of PSP1
contains a  domain,  which is also found in several hypothetical proteins from
both eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources:

 - Crithidia  fasciculata  RBP45  and  RBP33, subunits of the cycling sequence
   binding protein  (CSBP)  II.  RBP45 and RBP33 proteins bind specifically to
   the cycling sequences present in several mRNAs that accumulate periodically
   during the  cell  cycle.  RBP45  and  RBP33  are phosphoproteins, which are
   phosphorylated differentially  during  progression  through the cell cycle.
   Hypothetical proteins with high sequence similarity have been identified in
   other kinetoplastid organisms [2].
 - Bacillus   subtilis  yaaT  protein,  which  plays  a  significant  role  in
   phosphorelay during initiation of sporulation. It is possible that the yaaT
   protein is  also  related  to  DNA  replication.  The  sequence of the yaaT
   protein is  widely conserved in prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), but the
   functions of the protein are unknown [3].

The actual  biological  significance of the PSP1 C-terminal domain has not yet
been clearly established.

The profile we developed covers the entire PSP1 C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 2008 / First entry.
