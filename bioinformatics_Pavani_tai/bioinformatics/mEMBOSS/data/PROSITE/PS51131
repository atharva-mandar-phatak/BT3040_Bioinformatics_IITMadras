* Rad50 zinc-hook domain profile *
**********************************

The  MRN  complex  (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1)  plays  an  important  role  in many DNA
metabolic  events  that  involve DNA double-stranded breaks. MRN is one of the
first  factors to be localized to DNA lesions where it might have a structural
role by tethering and stabilizing broken chromosomes [1,2].

Rad50  is  a  split  ABC-type ATPase; its center contains a long heptad repeat
that  folds  into an antiparallel coiled coil, bringing the N-terminal (Walker
A)  and  the C-terminal (Walker B) domains in close proximity (see <PDB:1L8D>)
[3].  The  apex  of  the  coiled  coil  contains  a  dimerization interface, a
conserved  Cys-x-x-Cys  motif  in  a  hook-shaped domain that dimerizes with a
second  hook  domain  via  cysteine-mediated  zinc  ion  coordination (see the
schematic representation below). This zinc dependent dimerization event allows
the  formation  of  a  complex that has appropriate lenghts and conformational
proporties  to link sister chromatids in homologous recombination and DNA ends
in non-homologous end-joining.
