* ATP P2X receptors signature *
*******************************

P2X purinoreceptors  [1,2]  are  cation-selective  ion  channels  that open on
binding to  extracellular  ATP; they play a role in fast synaptic transmission
between neurones,  and  from  autonomic  nerves to smooth muscles. When ATP is
released as  a  neurotransmitter from central and peripheral nerves it acts at
P2X receptors to produce postsynaptic depolarization and excitation.

P2X receptors  are  from  397 to 595 amino acids long. They consist of a short
intracellular N-terminus  region  followed  by a transmembrane domain, a large
extracellular loop   that   contains   10   conserved   cysteines,   a  second
transmembrane segment and a C-terminal intracellular tail.

Currently, seven forms (P2X1 to P2X7) of P2X receptors are known.

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region located in the central
part of  the  extracellular  domain  and  which  contains two of the conserved
cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: G-G-x-[LIVM]-G-[LIVM]-x-[IV]-x-W-x-C-[DN]-L-D-x(5)-C-x-P-
                    x-Y-x-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / First entry.
