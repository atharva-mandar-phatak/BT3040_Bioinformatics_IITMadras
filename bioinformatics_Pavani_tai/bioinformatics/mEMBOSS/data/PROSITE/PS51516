*********************************
* Sox C-terminal domain profile *
*********************************

The Sox   family   of   high   mobility  group  (HMG)  box  (see  <PDOC00305>)
transcription factors  that  are  homologous  to the Y-chromosome encoded sex-
determining factor  SRY plays important roles in embryonic development. Sox18,
together with  Sox7  and  -17,  constitutes the subgroup F within this family.
Bioinformatic analysis  of the C-termini of subgroup F Sox family members from
different species  including  humans,  mice, rat, chicken and Xenopus revealed
three conserved  blocks  including highly conserved residues. They were termed
proline, charged,  and  serine according to the predominance of the respective
amino acids. The charged block comprises a strong transactivating domain [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire Sox C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2010 / First entry.
