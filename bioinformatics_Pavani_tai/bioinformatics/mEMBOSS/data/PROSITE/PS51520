* Alphavirus nsp2 protease (nsp2pro) domain profile *
*****************************************************

The family of alphaviruses includes 26 known members. They infect a variety of
hosts including  mosquitoes,  birds,  rodents and other mammals with worldwide
distribution. Alphaviruses  also  pose  a  potential threat to human health in
many area.  For  example,  Venezuelan  Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) causes
encephalitis in  humans as well as livestock in Central and South America, and
some variants  of  Sinbis Virus (SIN) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) have been
found to cause fever and arthritis in humans [1].

Alphaviruses possess a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb [E1].
The genomic  RNA  of  alphaviruses  is  translated into two polyproteins that,
respectively, encode  structural  proteins  and  nonstructural  proteins.  The
nonstructural proteins may be translated as one or two polyproteins, nsp123 or
nsp1234, depending  on  the  virus. These polyproteins are cleaved to generate
nsp1, nsp2, nsp3 and nsp4 by a protease activity that resides within nsp2. The
nsp2 protein  of alphaviruses has multiple enzymatic acivities. Its N-terminal
domain has  been  shown  to  possess  ATPase and GTPase activity, RNA helicase
activity and  RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity. The C-terminal nsp2pro domain of
nsp2 is  responsible  for  the  regulation  of  26S  subgenome  RNA synthesis,
switching between  negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis, targeting nsp2
for nuclear   transport   and  proteolytic  processing  of  the  nonstructural
polyprotein [1,2].  The  nsp2pro  domain is a member of peptidase family C9 of
clan CA [E2].

The nsp2pro  domain  consists of two distinct subdomains (see <PDB:2HWK>). The
nsp2pro N-terminal   subdomain  is  largely  alpha-helical  and  contains  the
catalytic dyad  cysteine  and  histidine  residues organized in a protein fold
that differs  significantly from any known cysteine protease or protein folds.
The nsp2pro C-terminal subdomain displays structural similarity to S-adenosyl-
L-methionine-dependent RNA  methyltransferases and provides essential elements
that contribute  to  substrate recognition and may also regulate the structure
of the substrate binding cleft [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire nsp2pro domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
