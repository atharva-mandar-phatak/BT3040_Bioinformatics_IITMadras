* Phosphoketolase signatures *
******************************

Phosphoketolases are   key   enzymes  of  the  pentose  phosphate  pathway  of
heterofermentative and  facultative  homofermentative lactic acid bacteria and
of the  D-fructose  6-phosphate  shunt of bifidobacteria. PK activity has been
sporadically reported in other microorganisms including eukaryotic yeasts. Pks
catalyze an  irreversible thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) dependent phosphorolytic
reaction splitting  D-xylulose  5-phosphate  (EC  4.1.2.9)  or  D-fructose  6-
phosphate (EC 4.1.2.22) in the presence of inorganic phosphate to yield acetyl
phosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate, respectively [1].

A multiple  alignment  of PK sequences shows several highly conserved regions.
We selected  two  of these regions as signature patterns for PKs. The function
of the  first  one  is  not  known,  whereas the second correspond to the ThDP
binding site [1].
