***********************************************
* TonB-dependent receptor proteins signatures *
***********************************************

In Escherichia coli the tonB protein interacts  with  outer  membrane receptor
proteins that  carry  out high-affinity binding and energy-dependent uptake of
specific substrates  into  the  periplasmic space. These substrates are either
poorly permeable  through  the  porin  channels or are encountered at very low
concentrations. In the absence  of tonB these  receptors bind their substrates
but do not carry out active transport.  The tonB  protein  also interacts with
some colicins.  The  proteins that are currently known or presumed to interact
with tonB are:

  Gene   Function or name
  ----   -------------------------------------------------------------------
  btuB   Receptor for cobalamin.
  cirA   Receptor for colicin I (exact substrate not known).
  fatA   Receptor for ferric anguibactin (Vibrio anguillarum).
  fcuA   Receptor for ferrichrome (Yersinia enterocolitica).
  fecA   Receptor for iron dicitrate.
  fepA   Receptor for ferrienterobactin (ferric enterochelin).
  fhuA   Receptor for ferrichrome-iron.
  fhuE   Receptor for ferric coprogen, ferrioxamine B, and rhodotrulic acid.
  foxA   Receptor for ferrioxamine (Yersinia enterocolitica).
  fptA   Receptor for Fe(III)-pyochelin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
  fpvA   Receptor for ferripyoverdine (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
  fyuA   Receptor for pesticin and yersiniabactin (Yersinia).
  hemR   Receptor for hemin (Yersinia enterocolitica).
  hxuC   Receptor for heme/hemopexin (Haemophilus influenzae).
  irgA   Receptor for ferric vibriobactin (Vibrio cholerae).
  iroA   Receptor for a siderophore (Neisseria meningitidis).
  iutA   Receptor for ferric aerobactin.
  pbuA   Receptor for ferric pseudobactin M114 (Pseudomonas strain M114).
  pfeA   Receptor for ferric enterobactin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
  pupA   Receptor for ferric pseudobactin 358 (Pseudomonas putida).
  pupB   Receptor for ferric pseudobactin BN7 and BN8 (Pseudomonas putida).
  tbp1   Receptor for transferrin (Neisseria and Haemophilus).

  Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical proteins HI0262, HI0661, HI0635, HI0712,
  HI1217, and HI1567.

  cba    Colicin B, a channel forming colicin.
  cda    Colicin D.
  cma    Colicin M, inhibitor of murein biosynthesis.

Most of  these proteins contain, at their N-terminus, a short conserved region
[1,2,3],  called the tonB-box, involved in the interaction of the protein with
the tonB protein [4]. With  the  exception of the colicin B, D and M receptors
they all  also contain, in their C-terminal extremity a short conserved domain
that contains two invariant residues.
