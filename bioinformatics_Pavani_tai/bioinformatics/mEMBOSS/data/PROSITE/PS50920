******************************************

Different types of substrate carrier  proteins involved in energy transfer are
found in the inner mitochondrial membrane [1 to 5]. These are:

 - The ADP,ATP carrier protein (AAC)  (ADP/ATP translocase)  which exports ATP
   into the  cytosol and  imports  ADP  into  the  mitochondrial  matrix.  The
   sequence of AAC has been obtained from various mammalian, plant  and fungal
   species.
 - The  2-oxoglutarate/malate    carrier    protein  (OGCP),  which    exports
   2-oxoglutarate into the cytosol and imports  malate  or  other dicarboxylic
   acids into  the  mitochondrial matrix. This protein plays an important role
   in several  metabolic  processes  such  as  the  malate/aspartate  and  the
   oxoglutarate/isocitrate shuttles.
 - The phosphate carrier protein, which transports  phosphate  groups from the
   cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix.
 - The brown fat uncoupling  protein (UCP) which dissipates  oxidative  energy
   into heat by transporting protons  from  the cytosol into the mitochondrial
   matrix.
 - The tricarboxylate transport  protein (or citrate transport  protein) which
   is involved   in  citrate-H+/malate  exchange.  It  is  important  for  the
   bioenergetics of  hepatic  cells  as  it provides a carbon source for fatty
   acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD for the glycolytic pathway.
 - The  Grave's  disease  carrier protein (GDC), a protein of unknown function
   recognized by IgG in patients with active Grave's disease.
 - Yeast mitochondrial proteins MRS3 and MRS4.  The exact  function  of  these
   proteins is not known. They suppress a mitochondrial splice defect  in  the
   first intron  of  the  COB  gene  and  may  act as carriers, exerting their
   suppressor activity    by   modulating   solute   concentrations   in   the
   mitochondrion.
 - Yeast mitochondrial FAD carrier protein (gene FLX1).
 - Yeast  protein  ACR1  [6],  which  seems  essential for acetyl-CoA synthase
   activity.
 - Yeast protein PET8.
 - Yeast protein PMT.
 - Yeast protein RIM2.
 - Yeast protein YHM1/SHM1.
 - Yeast protein YMC1.
 - Yeast protein YMC2.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins  YBR291c,  YEL006w, YER053c,  YFR045w, YHR002w,
   and YIL006w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K11H3.3.

Two other  proteins  have  been  found  to  belong to this family, yet are not
localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane:

 - Maize amyloplast Brittle-1 protein. This protein, found in the endosperm of
   kernels, could play a role in amyloplast membrane transport.
 - Candida  boidinii  peroxisomal  membrane  protein  PMP47  [7].  PMP47 is an
   integral membrane  protein  of  the  peroxisome and it may play a role as a
   transporter.

These proteins all seem to be evolutionary related. Structurally, they consist
of three tandem repeats  of  a  domain of approximately  one hundred residues.
Each of these domains contains two transmembrane regions.

The profile we developed covers the entire solute carrier (Solcar) repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: August 2003 / Pattern removed and profile added.
