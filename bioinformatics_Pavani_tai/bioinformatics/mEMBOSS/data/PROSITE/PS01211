* Uncharacterized protein family UPF0001 signature *
****************************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Yeast chromosome II hypothetical protein YBL036c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F09E5.8.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ylmE.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yggS and HI0090, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0395.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY270.20.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0556.
 - A Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypothetical protein in pilT 5'region.
 - A Vibrio alginolyticus hypothetical protein in pilT 5'region.

These are    proteins  of from 25 to 30 Kd which contain a number of conserved
regions. As  a  signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region which
is located in the first third of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [FW]-H-[FM]-[IV]-G-x-[LIV]-Q-x-[NKRQ]-[KN]-x(3)-[LIV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
