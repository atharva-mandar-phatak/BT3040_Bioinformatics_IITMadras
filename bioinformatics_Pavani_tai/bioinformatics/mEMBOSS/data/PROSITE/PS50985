* GRAS family profile *
***********************

GRAS proteins are a family of plant-specific proteins named after GAI, RGA and
SCR,  the  first  three  of  its  members isolated. GRAS proteins are putative
transcription  factors  that  exert  important roles in very diverse processes
such as signal transduction, meristem maintenance and development [1].

GRAS  proteins contain a conserved region of about 350 amino acids that can be
divided  in  5  motifs, found in the following order: leucine heptad repeat I,
the  VHIID  motif, leucine heptad repeat II, the PFYRE motif and the SAW motif
[1,2]. Plant specific GRAS proteins have parallels in their motif structure to
the animal Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) family of
proteins [3] which suggests also some parallels in their functions.

Some proteins known to belong to the GRAS family are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  SCARECROW (SCR) protein. It regulates asymetric cell
   divisions of cortex/endodermal initial cells during root development.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL) protein.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  GIBBERELLIN-ACID  INSENSITIVE (GAI) and REPRESSOR OF
   GA1 (RGA), two closely related proteins involved in gibberellin  signaling.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  SHORT  ROOT  (SHR) protein. It is necessary for cell
   division and endodermis specification.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  PAT1  protein.  It  inhibits light signaling via the
   phytochrome A (phyA).
 - LATERAL  SUPPRESSOR (LS), a protein from tomato that controls the formation
   of lateral branches during vegetative development.

The profile we developed covers the whole conserved region.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
