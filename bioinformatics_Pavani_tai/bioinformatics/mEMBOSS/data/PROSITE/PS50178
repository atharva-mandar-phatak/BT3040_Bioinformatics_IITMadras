* Zinc finger FYVE/FYVE-related type profile *
**********************************************

The FYVE  domain  has  been  named  after  the  first letter of the first four
proteins in  which it was found (Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1). It is a
cysteine-rich domain  of  about 70 amino acids that coordinates two Zn2+ ions.
The FYVE  domain  is found in several eukaryotic non-nuclear proteins involved
in distinct   cellular   functions,   including   vesicle   transport,  signal
transduction and  cytoskeletal regulation. FYVE domains are generally found in
one copy  but  two  copies  can  also  be  found. Positions of FYVE domains in
different proteins vary from the extreme N-terminus to the extreme C-terminus.
FYVE domains  are  found  associated  with  other  domains  such  as  IQ  (see
<PDOC50096>), PH  (see  <PDOC50003>),  VHS,  RCC,  SH2 (see <PDOC50001>), RING
finger (see  <PDOC00449>)  or  C2H2 zinc finger (see <PDOC00028>) [1,2,3]. The
function of  the  FYVE domain is to target signal-transducing proteins to cell
membranes through   binding  to  the  membrane  lipid  phosphatidylinositol-3-
phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) with high specificity [4,5].

The FYVE  domain  has eight conserved cysteines, which coordinate the two Zn2+
ions in  a  'cross-braced'  topology: the first Zn2+ ion is coordinated by the
first and  third  pairs of cysteines, and the second ion is coordinated by the
second and  fourth  pairs. In addition, the FYVE domain contains several other
conserved residues,   most  prominently  a  basic  R-[RK]-H-H-C-R-x-C-G  motif
surrounding the  third and fourth cysteine residues. Several hydrophobic amino
acid positions  are  also  conserved among the FYVE fingers, as is an isolated
arginine residue  towards  the C-terminus [2,6]. Resolution of the crystal and
solution structures  of  the  FYVE  domain  has  shown that it consists of two
double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, which are stabilized by the two zinc
ions and  a  C-terminal  alpha-helix. The conserved R-[RK]-H-H-C-R-x-C-G motif
and the  conserved  arginine  residue  form  a  basic  pocket  involved in the
inositol head group binding [6,7].

The FYVE-related  domain  is  found  in several proteins involved in regulated
secretion, such  as  Rabphilin-3A and Rim. Although the structure of the FYVE-
related domain  is  closely related to the one of the genuine FYVE domain, the
FYVE-related domain lacks several of the conserved feature of the FYVE domain,
like the  basic R-[RK]-H-H-C-R-x-C-G motif, and it does not bind to PtdIns(3)P
[2,4,6].

Some proteins  known  to  contain  a  FYVE or a FYVE-related domain are listed
below:

 - Animal   Hrs,   an   hepatocyte  growth  factor-regulated  tyrosine  kinase
   substrate. Hrs  is  localised  to early endosomes in a manner that requires
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity.
 - Animal Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA), an important mediator of
   transforming growth  factor  beta  (TGF-beta) signalling. It is responsible
   for the  recruitment  of  Smad2  and  Smad3  to  the TGF-beta receptor upon
   receptor stimulation.
 - Mammalian Fgd1, a protein implicated in cytoskeletal regulation. It acts as
   a guanine  nucleotide  exchange  factor for Cdc42, a Rho-family GTPase that
   controls the  submembraneous actin cytoskeleton. In human, mutations in the
   gene coding   for   the  Fgd1  protein  are  associated  with  faciogenital
   dysplasia, an   X-linked   autosomal   disease  primarily  associated  with
   skeletal, facial and genital anomalies.
 - Mammalian  early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), which fuses endosome and relies
   on its   FYVE  domain  for  specific  localization  to  PtdIns(3)P-enriched
   membranes and for recruiting regulatory Rab5 and syntaxin proteins.
 - Human Rabenosyn-5, a rab5 effector that is localized to early endosomes and
   required for endosome fusion.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK632.12.
 - Yeast  VAC1  protein.  It  is  required for vacuole segregation and vacuole
   protein sorting.  Possibly  part  of  a  complex  which tethers the vacuole
   membrane to  microtubules,  either  directly  or via kinesin or dynein-like
   motor proteins.   Probably  functions  in  several  interorganelle  traffic
   pathways.
 - Yeast vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein VPS27. It is required for
   membrane traffic to the vacuole.
 - Yeast   FAB1   protein,  a  PI  5-kinase  that  converts  PtdIns(3)-P  into
   PtdIns(3,5)P2. It   is   implicated  in  the  formation  of  multivesicular
   endosome.

 - Animal  rabphilin-3A,  an  effector  of  the  Rab3A GTPase. Activated Rab3A
   reversibly recruits rabphilin-3A to synaptic vesicles.
 - Mammalian  proteins  of  the  Rim  family.  They are effectors of the Rab3A
   GTPase. Rim  proteins have sequence similarity to rabphilin-3A but localize
   to the  active  zone  of  the  presynaptic  plasma  membrane  instead of to
   synaptic vesicles.
