* Inositol monophosphatase family signatures *
**********************************************

It has been shown [1] that several proteins share two sequence motifs.  Two of
these  proteins  are  enzymes  of  the  inositol  phosphate  second  messenger
signalling pathway:

 - Vertebrate,    plants    and    microbial    myo-inositol   monophosphatase
   (EC 3.1.3.25).
 - Vertebrate inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.57).

The function of the other proteins is not yet clear:

 - Bacterial  protein  cysQ.  CysQ  could  help  to  control  the pool of PAPS
   (3'-phosphoadenoside 5'-phosphosulfate), or be useful in sulfite synthesis.
 - Neurospora crassa protein Qa-X. Probably involved in quinate metabolism.
 - Emericella nidulans protein qutG. Probably involved in quinate metabolism.
 - Yeast  protein  HAL2/MET22  [2]  involved  in  salt  tolerance  as  well as
   methionine biosynthesis.
 - Yeast hypothetical hypothetical protein YHR046c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F13G3.5.

It is suggested [1] that these proteins may  act by enhancing the synthesis or
degradation of phosphorylated messenger molecules. From the X-ray structure of
human  inositol monophosphatase [3], it  seems  that  some  of  the  conserved
residues are involved in binding a metal ion and/or the phosphate group of the
substrate.
