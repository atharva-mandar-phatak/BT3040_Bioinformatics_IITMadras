* REJ domain profile *
**********************

The REJ  domain is an extracellular module of ~700 amino acids, which is found
associated with  others  domains,  such  as  EGF  (see  <PDOC00021>),  the GPS
proteolytic cleavage  site (see <PDOC50221>), C-type lectin (see <PDOC00537>),
SUEL-type lectin  (see <PDOC50228>), LRR, LDL-A, PLAT (see <PDOC50095>) or PKD
(see <PDOC50093>)  [1,2]. Although its function is unknown, the REJ domain has
been shown  to  be  required for cleavage to occur at the GPS [3]. It has been
proposed that the REJ domain might function in ion transport homeostasis [1].

Some proteins known to contain a REJ domain are listed below:

 - Sea  urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly 1 (suREJ1). It binds to the fucose
   sulfate polymer of egg jelly to induce the sperm acrosome reaction [4].
 - Sea  urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly 2 (suREJ2). It is present over the
   entire sperm   plasma   membrane,   but  is  concentrated  over  the  sperm
   mitochondrion [4].
 - Sea  urchin  sperm receptor for egg jelly 3 (suREJ3). It localizes over the
   acrosomal vesicle [4].
 - Human  autosomal  dominant polycystic kidney disease protein polycystin-1.
   It is thought to be part of a plasma membrane signaling/ion channel complex
   involved in  maintaining  the  terminally  differentiated  state  of  renal
   tubular epithelial cells.
 - Mammalian  polycystic  kidney  disease  and  receptor for egg jelly related
   protein (PKDREJ), a testis-specific protein whose function is unknown [5].
 - Mammalian polycystic kidney disease 1-like 1 protein (PKD1L1),

The profile we developed covers the entire REJ domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
