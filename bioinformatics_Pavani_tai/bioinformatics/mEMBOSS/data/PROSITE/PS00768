* Transthyretin signatures *
****************************

Transthyretin (prealbumin) [1] is a thyroid hormone-binding protein that seems
to transport thyroxine (T4) from the bloodstream to the brain. It is a protein
of about  130  amino  acids that  assembles as a homotetramer and  forms    an
internal channel that binds thyroxine. Transthyretin is mainly synthesized  in
the brain  choroid  plexus.  In humans, variants of the protein are associated
with distinct forms of amyloidosis.

The sequence  of transthyretin is highly conserved in vertebrates. A number of
uncharacterized proteins also belong to this family:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yedX.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yunM.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R09H10.3.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK697.8.

We selected  two  regions  as  signature patterns. The first located in the N-
terminal extremity  starts  with a lysine  known to be involved in binding T4.
The second pattern is located in the C-terminal extremity.

-Consensus pattern: [KH]-[IV]-L-[DN]-x(3)-G-x-P-[AG]-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-[IV]
                    [The K binds thyroxine]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [YWF]-[TH]-[IVT]-[AP]-x(2)-[LIVM]-[STA]-[PQ]-[FYWG]-[GS]-
                    [FY]-[QST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
