* Plant hemoglobins signature *
*******************************

Leghemoglobins [1] are hemoproteins  present in the root nodules of leguminous
plants. Leghemoglobins are structurally and functionally related to hemoglobin
and myoglobin.  By providing  oxygen to the bacteroids, they are essential for
symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

Structurally related  hemoglobins  are found in nonsymbiotic plants where they
may not  function as an oxygen storage or transport proteins, but might act as
an oxygen sensors [2].

We have  developed  a signature pattern that exclusively picks up the sequence
of plants  hemoglobins.  It  is centered on an histidine that acts as the heme
iron distal ligand.

-Consensus pattern: [SN]-P-x-[LV]-x(2)-H-A-x(3)-F
                    [H is an heme iron ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
