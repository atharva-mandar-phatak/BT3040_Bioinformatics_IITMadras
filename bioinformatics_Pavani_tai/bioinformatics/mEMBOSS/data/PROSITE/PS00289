* Pentaxin family signature *
*****************************

Pentaxins (or pentraxins) [1,2] are a  family  of  proteins  which show, under
electron  microscopy,  a  discoid  arrangement  of  five  noncovalently  bound
subunits. Proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein which, in  mammals, is expressed during
   acute phase response to tissue injury or inflammation. CRP displays several
   functions  associated  with   host  defense:  it  promotes   agglutination,
   bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis  and complement  fixation through
   its calcium-dependent binding  to phosphorylcholine.   CRPs  have also been
   sequenced in an invertebrate, the Atlantic horseshoe crab, where they are a
   normal constituent of the hemolymph.
 - Serum Amyloid P-component (SAP), a precursor of amyloid  component P  which
   is found in basement membrane and is associated with amyloid deposits.
 - Hamster  female  protein  (FP),  a  plasma  protein  whose concentration is
   altered by sex steroids and stimuli that elicit an acute phase response.

A number of proteins, whose  function is  not yet clear,  contain a C-terminal
pentaxin-like domain. These proteins are:

 - Human PTX3 (or TSG-14). PTX3 is a cytokine-induced protein.
 - Guinea  pig  apexin  [3], a sperm acrosomal protein. Apexin seems to be the
   ortholog of human neuronal pentraxin II (gene NPTX2) [4].
 - Rat neuronal pentaxin I [5].

The sequences of the different members of this family are quite conserved.  As
a signature,  we  selected  a six residue pattern  which  includes a  cysteine
known to be involved in a disulfide bridge in CRPs and SAP.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-C-x-[ST]-W-x-[ST]
                    [The C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
