* Glutamine amidotransferase type 1 domain profile *
****************************************************

A  large group of biosynthetic enzymes are able to catalyze the removal of the
ammonia group from glutamine and then to transfer this group to a substrate to
form  a  new  carbon-nitrogen  group.  This  catalytic  activity  is  known as
glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) (EC 2.4.2.-) [1]. The GATase domain exists
either  as  a separate polypeptidic subunit or as part of a larger polypeptide
fused  in  different  ways  to  a  synthase  domain.  On the basis of sequence
similarities two classes of GATase domains have been identified [2,3]: class-I
(also  known  as  trpG-type or triad) and class-II (also known as purF-type or
Ntn)  (see <PDOC00406>). Class-I (or type 1) GATase domains have been found in
the following enzymes:

 - The  second  component  of anthranilate synthase (AS) (EC 4.1.3.27) [4]. AS
   catalyzes  the  biosynthesis of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine.
   AS  is  generally  a  dimeric  enzyme:  the  first component can synthesize
   anthranilate  using  ammonia  rather  than  glutamine, whereas component II
   provides  the GATase activity (see <PDB:1QDL; B>) [5]. In some bacteria and
   in  fungi  the  GATase component of AS is part of a multifunctional protein
   that also catalyzes other steps of the biosynthesis of tryptophan.
 - The second component of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase (EC 4.1.3.
   -),  a  dimeric  prokaryotic  enzyme  that  functions  in  the pathway that
   catalyzes the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoate (PABA) from chorismate and
   glutamine.  The  second  component (gene pabA) provides the GATase activity
   [4].
 - CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2). CTP synthase catalyzes the final reaction in the
   biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the ATP-dependent formation of CTP from UTP and
   glutamine. CTP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct
   domains;   the  GATase  domain  is  in  the  C-terminal  section  [2]  (see
   <PDB:1S1M>).
 - GMP  synthase  (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.2). GMP synthase catalyzes
   the  ATP-dependent  formation  of  GMP  from  xanthosine  5'-phosphate  and
   glutamine. GMP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct
   domains;  the  GATase  domain  is  in  the  N-terminal  section  [6,7] (see
   <PDB:1GPM>).
 - Glutamine-dependent  carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.5.5) (GD-CPSase);
   an  enzyme  involved in both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and which
   catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine
   and  carbon dioxide. In bacteria GD-CPSase is composed of two subunits: the
   large chain (gene carB) provides the CPSase activity, while the small chain
   (gene  carA) provides the GATase activity (see <PDB:1A9X; B>). In yeast the
   enzyme  involved in arginine biosynthesis is also composed of two subunits:
   CPA1 (GATase), and CPA2 (CPSase). In most eukaryotes, the first three steps
   of  pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a large multifunctional enzyme
   (called  URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in mammals). The
   GATase  domain  is  located at the N-terminal extremity of this polyprotein
   [8].
 - Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine  synthase  (EC  6.3.5.3),  an enzyme that
   catalyzes  the  fourth step in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. In some
   species  of  bacteria  and  archaea,  FGAM  synthase  II is composed of two
   subunits:  a small chain (gene purQ) which provides the GATase activity and
   a  large  chain  (gene  purL)  which  provides  the  aminator  activity. In
   eukaryotes  and  Gram-negative bacteria a single polypeptide (large type of
   purL)  contains  a FGAM synthethase domain and the GATase as the C-terminal
   domain (see <PDB:1T3T>) [9].
 - Imidazole  glycerol phosphate synthase subunit hisH (EC 2.4.2.-), an enzyme
   that  catalyzes  the  fifth  step  in  the  biosynthesis  of histidine (see
   <PDB:1JVN>).

A  triad of conserved Cys-His-Glu forms the active site, wherein the catalytic
cysteine  is  essential  for  the  amidotransferase activity [7,10]. Different
structures  show  that  the active site Cys of type 1 GATase is located at the
tip of a nucleophile elbow.

The profile we developed covers the entire GATase type 1 domain, including the
catalytic  Cys  in the N-terminal half of the domain and the conserved His and
Glu of the triad in the C-terminal part of the domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note:  The  GATase  type  1 domain profile is in competition with profiles of
 related  domains, which include cobBQ-type GATase (see <PDOC51274>), pdxT/SNO
 (see  <PDOC00950>),  gamma-glutamyl  hydrolase  (see  <PDOC51275>)  and  PfpI
 endopeptidase (see <PDOC51276>).
