************************************************

Seminal vesicle  protein II (SVP-II) [1] is  one  of  the six  major secretory
proteins secreted by rat seminal vesicle. It is a clotting protein that serves
as the substrate in the  formation of the copulatory plug.  Covalent  clotting
of this protein is catalyzed by a transglutaminase and involves  the formation
of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinks. SVS-II sequence contains thirteen
repeats of a thirteen amino acid  residue domain which is probably involved in
the cross-linking.  There  are a  number of invariant residues in this domain,
four of them  (two lysines and two glutamines)  probably  participate  in  the
cross-links.  The pattern we have developed comprises positions 2 to 12 of the
domain and includes the four putative cross-linking residues.

-Consensus pattern: [GSA]-Q-x-K-S-[FY]-x-Q-x-K-[SA]
                    [The 2 Q's and the 2 K's are probably involved in cross-links]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL; it will
 detect 12 of the 13 occurrences of the repeat.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
