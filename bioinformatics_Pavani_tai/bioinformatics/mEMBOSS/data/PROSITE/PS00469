**********************************************

Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) (NDK) [1] are enzymes required for
the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP)  other than ATP.  They provide
NTPs for   nucleic   acid   synthesis,   CTP  for  lipid  synthesis,  UTP  for
polysaccharide synthesis  and  GTP for protein elongation, signal transduction
and microtubule polymerization.

In eukaryotes, there seems to be a small family  of NDK isozymes each of which
acts in  a  different subcellular compartment and/or has a distinct biological
function. Eukaryotic NDK isozymes are hexamers of two highly related chains (A
and B)  [2].    By  random association (A6, A5B...AB5, B6), these two kinds of
chain form isoenzymes differing in their isoelectric point.

NDK are  proteins  of  17  Kd  that  act  via a ping-pong mechanism in which a
histidine residue  is  phosphorylated, by transfer  of  the terminal phosphate
group from  ATP.  In the presence of magnesium, the phosphoenzyme can transfer
its phosphate group to any NDP, to produce an NTP.

NDK isozymes have been  sequenced from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.  It
has also been shown [3] that the Drosophila awd (abnormal wing discs) protein,
is a  microtubule-associated NDK.  Mammalian NDK  is also  known as metastasis
inhibition factor nm23.

The sequence of NDK has been highly  conserved through evolution.  There  is a
single histidine  residue  conserved  in  all  known  NDK  isozymes,  which is
involved in  the  catalytic mechanism [2]. Our signature pattern contains this
residue.

-Consensus pattern: N-x(2)-H-[GA]-S-D-[GSA]-[LIVMPKNE]
                    [H may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
