* SEC7 domain profile *
***********************

The  SEC7  domain  was  named  after the first protein found to contain such a
region  [1]. SEC7 family proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
specific  for  the ADP-rybosylation factors (ARF), a Ras-like GTPases which is
important for vesicular protein trafficking. Although SEC7 proteins are highly
divergent  in their overall sequence they share a common region of roughly 200
amino  acids  known  as the SEC7 domain. Proteins containing a SEC7 domain are
found in fungi, animals and plants.

SEC7  domains  mediate  interaction with ARF and catalyses GDP to GTP exchange
[2,3,4]. Crystal structure of the human ARNO SEC7 domain has been solved [5,6]
and  consist  of  10 alpha-helices. The helices are arranged in a right-handed
superhelix   reminiscent   of   that   found   in  the  armadillo-repeat  (see
<PDOC50176>).  The  C-terminal  part  of  the domain mediates interaction with
Arf-1 through hydrophobic and polar residues. The nucleotide exchange activity
is  dependent  on  a  conserved  glutamate residue located in the loop between
helix f and g [5,6]. The corresponding residue in Arabidopsis Emb30 protein is
mutated to a lysine in a deficient allele [7].

Some proteins known to contain a SEC7 domain are listed below.

 - Yeast SEC7 protein. Associated with ER, essential for fusion of vesicles to
   the Golgi.
 - Mammalian cytohesin 1.
 - Mammalian cytohesin 2 (ARF nucleotide-binding site opener; ARNO).
 - Mammalian cytohesin 3.
 - Mammalian cytohesin 4.
 - Mammalian  brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins 1 and
   2 (ARFGEP1 and ARFGEP2).
 - Mammalian golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange
   factor 1 (GBF1).

We developed a profile that spans the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
