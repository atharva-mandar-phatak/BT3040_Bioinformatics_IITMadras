* Intermediate filaments signature *
************************************

Intermediate filaments   (IF)   [1,2,3]  are  proteins  which  are  primordial
components of  the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope.  They generally form
filamentous structures  8  to  14  nm  wide. IF proteins are members of a very
large multigene  family  of  proteins  which has been subdivided in five major
subgroups:

 - Type   I: Acidic cytokeratins.
 - Type  II: Basic cytokeratins.
 - Type III: Vimentin,  desmin,   glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein   (GFAP),
   peripherin, and plasticin.
 - Type  IV: Neurofilaments L, H and M, alpha-internexin and nestin.
 - Type   V: Nuclear lamins A, B1, B2 and C.

All IF proteins  are structurally  similar in  that they consist of: a central
rod domain comprising  some 300 to  350 residues which is  arranged in coiled-
coiled alpha-helices,  with at least two short characteristic interruptions; a
N-terminal non-helical  domain  (head)  of variable  length; and a  C-terminal
domain (tail)  which is also   non-helical,  and which   shows  extreme length
variation between different IF proteins.

While IF proteins are evolutionary and structurally related, they have limited
sequence homologies  except in several regions of the rod domain. We use, as a
sequence pattern  for  this  class of  proteins,  a conserved  region  at  the
C-terminal extremity of the rod domain.

-Consensus pattern: [IV]-{K}-[TACI]-Y-[RKH]-{E}-[LM]-L-[DE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Drosophila lamin DM0 and filensin.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.

-Note: In the third position of  the pattern, Ala is found in type IV and V IF
 proteins, Thr is found in IF proteins of  type I, II, III, and VI,  Cys in IF
 from snails, and Ile in IF from worms.   In the first position of the pattern
 Val is found in type VI, Ile is found in all other types.
