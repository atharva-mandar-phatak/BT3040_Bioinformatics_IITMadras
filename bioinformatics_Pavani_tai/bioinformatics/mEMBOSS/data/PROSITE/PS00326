* Tropomyosins signature *
**************************

Tropomyosins [1,2] are family of closely  related  proteins  present in muscle
and non-muscle cells. In striated muscle, tropomyosin mediate the interactions
between the  troponin  complex and actin so as to regulate muscle contraction.
The role of tropomyosin in smooth muscle  and non-muscle tissues is not clear.
Tropomyosin is an alpha-helical protein that forms a coiled-coil dimer.

Muscle isoforms of tropomyosin are  characterized  by  having  284  amino acid
residues and a highly  conserved N-terminal  region,  whereas non-muscle forms
are generally smaller and are heterogeneous in their N-terminal region.

The signature pattern for tropomyosins  is based on a very conserved region in
the C-terminal section of tropomyosins and which is present in both muscle and
non-muscle forms.

-Consensus pattern: L-K-[EAD]-A-E-x-R-A-[ET]
