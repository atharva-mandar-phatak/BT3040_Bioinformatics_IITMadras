* S-adenosylmethionine synthase signatures *
********************************************

S-adenosylmethionine synthase  (EC  2.5.1.6)  is the enzyme that catalyzes the
formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from methionine and ATP [1]. AdoMet
is an important  methyl donor for transmethylation and is also the propylamino
donor in polyamine biosynthesis.

In bacteria  there  is  a single isoform of AdoMet synthase (gene metK), there
are two  in budding yeast (genes SAM1 and SAM2) and in mammals while in plants
there is generally a multigene family.

The sequence  of  AdoMet  synthase is highly conserved throughout isozymes and
species. We selected two signature patterns for this type of enzyme; the first
is a  hexapeptide  which seems to be involved in ATP-binding; the second is an
almost perfectly conserved glycine-rich nonapeptide.
