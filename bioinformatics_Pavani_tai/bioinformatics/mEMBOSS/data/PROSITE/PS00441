***********************************************

Chalcone synthases (CHS) (EC 2.3.1.74) and stilbene synthases (STS)  (formerly
known as  resveratrol synthases)  are  related  plant  enzymes [1].  CHS is an
important enzyme  in  flavanoid biosynthesis and STS a key enzyme in stilbene-
type phyloalexin  biosynthesis.  Both  enzymes  catalyze the addition of three
molecules of  malonyl-CoA  to  a  starter  CoA  ester  (a  typical  example is
4-coumaroyl-CoA), producing  either  a  chalcone  (with CHS) or stilbene (with
STS).

These enzymes  are  proteins  of  about  390  amino-acid residues. A conserved
cysteine residue,  located  in the central section of these proteins, has been
shown [2]  to  be  essential  for  the  catalytic activity of both enzymes and
probably represents  the binding site for the 4-coumaryl-CoA group. The region
around this  active  site  residue  is  well  conserved  and  can be used as a
signature pattern.

In addition  to the plant enzymes, this family also includes Bacillus subtilis
bcsA.
