*********************************
* 'Cold-shock' domain signature *
*********************************

A conserved  domain  of about 70 amino acids has been found in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic single-strand  nucleic-acid  binding proteins [1,2,3]. This domain,
which is  known  as  the  'cold-shock domain' (CSD) is present in the proteins
listed below.

 - Escherichia coli protein CS7.4 (gene cspA) which  is induced in response to
   low temperature (cold-shock protein) and which binds  to and stimulates the
   transcription of the CCAAT-containing promoters of the HN-S  protein and of
   gyrA.
 - Mammalian Y box binding protein 1 (YB1). A protein that binds to the CCAAT-
   containing Y box of mammalian HLA class II genes.
 - Xenopus Y box binding proteins -1 and -2 (Y1 and Y2). Proteins that bind to
   the CCAAT-containing Y box of Xenopus hsp70 genes.
 - Xenopus B box binding protein (YB3). YB3 binds the B  box  promoter element
   of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.
 - Enhancer factor I subunit A (EFI-A) (dbpB).  A  protein  that  also bind to
   CCAAT-motif in various gene promoters.
 - DbpA, a Human DNA-binding protein of unknown specificity.
 - Bacillus subtilis cold-shock proteins cspB and cspC.
 - Streptomyces clavuligerus protein SC 7.0.
 - Escherichia coli proteins cspB, cspC, cspD, cspE and cspF.
 - Unr, a mammalian gene encoded upstream of the N-ras gene. Unr contains nine
   repeats that are similar to the CSD domain.  The function of Unr is not yet
   known but it could be a multivalent DNA-binding protein.

As a signature pattern  for the CSD domain  we  selected  its  most  conserved
region which is located in its N-terminal section.  It  must be noted that the
beginning of this region is highly similar [4] to the RNP-1 RNA-binding motif.

-Consensus pattern: [FYKH]-G-[FL]-[IL]-x(6,7)-[DER]-[LIVM]-[FQ]-x-H-x-[STKR]-
                    x-[LIVMFYC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for E.coli cspF.  This pattern finds 4 out of the 9 repeats of the CSD domain
 in Unr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
