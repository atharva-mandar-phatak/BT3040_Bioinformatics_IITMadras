* EAL domain profile *
**********************

The EAL  domain  is  an  around 250-amino acid signaling domain. It is made of
four conserved  regions  and  has  been  named  EAL  according  to a conserved
sequence within  the  second  of  these  regions. The EAL domain is found in a
large number   of   eubacterial   multi-domain  proteins  involved  in  signal
transduction. The EAL domain is found in association with other domains of the
prokaryotic two-component  signal  transduction  systems,  such  as  the GGDEF
domain (see  <PDOC50887>),  the  response regulatory domain (see <PDOC50110>),
the PAS repeat and the PAC domain (see <PDOC50112>), the MHYT domain, the HAMP
domain (see  <PDOC50885>),  the  GAF domain, the TPR repeat, or the FHA domain
(see <PDOC50006>).  It has been proposed that the EAL domain might function as
a diguanylate  phosphodiesterase.  Accordingly,  it contains several conserved
acidic residues  that could participate in metal binding and potentially might
form a phosphodiesterase active site [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain an EAL domain are listed below:

 - Acetobacter xylinum diguanylate cyclase (DGC).
 - Acetobacter xylinum phosphodiesterase A (gene pdeA).
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ykoW.
 - Bordetella pertussis bvgR protein.
 - Escherichia coli rtn protein. It is involved in resistance to phages N4 and
   lambda.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yahA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yciR.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yddU.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfeA.
 - Escherichia coli protein yhjK.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjcC.
 - Klebsiella pneumoniae fimK protein.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv1354c.
 - Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 hypothetical protein Y4LL.
 - Synechocystis  sp.  strain  PCC  6803  nitrogen fixation positive activator
   protein.
 - Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0359.

The profile we developed covers the entire EAL domain.
