* SCAN box profile *
********************

This domain of around 80 amino acid residues has been called LeR because it is
a leucine  rich  region [1], or SCAN box from the first letter of the names of
the four  proteins  initially  found  to  contain it (SRE-ZBP, CTfin-51, AW-1,
Number 18 cDNA) [2]. The  SCAN box is essentially found in the N-terminal part
of transcription  factors  containing  a  zinc  finger  of  the C2H2 type (see
<PDOC00028>). These  proteins  can  either  activate or repress transcription,
although  isolated  recombinant  SCAN boxes do not modulate significantly  the
transcription [1,2].  In  addition to these zinc finger transcription factors,
an  isolated  SCAN box without adjacent zinc finger motifs has been identified
in some proteins [3,4].

The SCAN box is enriched in hydrophobic and negatively charged residues with a
L-X(6)-L motif  at  its  core.  This  core  is  flanked by A, E, L, M, H and C
residues that  are  frequently  found in alpha-helices [2]. Predictions of the
secondary structure  of  the  domain  suggest  the  presence of at least three
alpha-helices that  are  separated  from  one  another by short looped regions
bounded by  proline  residues  [5].  It  has  been  shown  to  be a  selective
oligomerization domain  that  mediates  homotypic and heterotypic interactions
between SCAN box containing proteins [4,5].

The following zinc-finger proteins have been shown to contain a SCAN box:

 - CTfin-51,   a   mouse   protein   that  has  been  shown  to  be  a  strong
   transcriptional activator.
 - SRE-ZBP, a human transcription factor that could function as a repressor of
   c-fos transcription.
 - Zinc finger proteins ZNF24, ZNF165, ZNF174, ZNF191, ZNF192, ZNF193, ZNF202,
   ZNF215, ZNF232, ZNF263, ZFP-29, ZFP-38, and ZFP-95.

And a number of proteins devoid of C2H2-type zinc-finger domain:

 - PGC-2  (PPAR-gamma  coactivator  2)  [3], a human protein that binds to and
   increases the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma.
 - SDP1  (SCAN-domain  protein  1) [4], a protein that interacts with the SCAN
   box of the zinc finger protein ZNF202.

The profile we developed spans the complete SCAN box.
