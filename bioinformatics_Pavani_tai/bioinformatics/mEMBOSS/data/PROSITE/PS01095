************************************

Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that  catalyze the  hydrolysis of the
beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  linkages in  chitin polymers.  From  the view
point of sequence similarity  chitinases  belong to either  family 18 or 19 in
the classification  of  glycosyl  hydrolases  [2,E1].  Chitinases of family 18
(also known as classes III or V) groups a variety of proteins:

 a) Chitinases from:

 - Prokaryotes such as Alteromonas, Bacillus, Serratia, Streptomyces, etc.
 - Plants such as Arabidopsis, cucumber, bean, tobacco, etc.
 - Fungi such as Aphanocladium, Rhizopus, Saccharomyces, etc.
 - Nematode (Brugia malayi).
 - Insects (Manduca sexta).
 - Baculoviruses (Autographa Californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis virus).

 b) Other proteins:

 - Hevamine, a rubber tree protein with chitinase and lysozyme activities.
 - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit, which acts as a chitinase.
 - Flavobacterium and Streptomyces endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.
   1.96).
 - Mammalian  di-N-acetylchitobiase  which  is  involved in the degradation of
   asparagine-linked glycoproteins.
 - Human cartilage glycoprotein Gp-39.
 - Jack  bean  concanavalin  B  (conB),  a protein that has lost its catalytic
   activity.

Site directed mutagenesis experiments [3] and crystallographic data [4,5] have
shown that  a  conserved  glutamate is involved in the catalytic mechanism and
probably acts as a proton donor. This  glutamate is  at  the  extremity of the
best conserved region in these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY]-[DN]-G-[LIVMF]-[DN]-[LIVMF]-[DN]-x-E
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for conB which has a Gln instead of the active site Glu.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
