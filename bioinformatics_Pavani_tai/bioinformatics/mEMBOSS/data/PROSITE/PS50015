* Saposin B-type domain profile *
*********************************

The  saposin  B-type domain is a ~80 amino acid domain present in saposins and
related  proteins  that  interact  with  lipids. The domain is named after the
small  lysosomal  proteins,  saposins,  which  serve as sphingolipid hydrolase
activator proteins in vertebrates. The mammalian saposins are synthesized as a
single  precursor  molecule  (prosaposin)  which  contains  two saposin A-type
domains  in  the  extremities that are removed in the activation reaction (see
<PDOC51110>),  and four saposin B-type domains yielding the active saposins A,
B,  C  and  D  after proteolytic cleavage. Saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs) can
have  different  functions,  such  as  enzymatic  activities,  as cofactors of
enzymes  involved  in  lipid  metabolism,  as  components  of  lung surfactant
reducing  the  surface  tension,  as  part  of  a  complex  involved  in stage
regulation  of  Dictyostelium,  as  antimicrobial  effector molecules, or as a
stimulator of dendritic outgrowth [1-4].

The  3D  structures of different SAPLIPs have been resolved, and show that the
saposin   B-type   domain  is  formed  by  a  four/five  helical  bundle  (see
<PDB:1SN6>).  The  saposin  B-type  domain  is  characterized by six conserved
cysteine  residues  involved in three disulfide bridges: one between helices 2
and  3,  one  between the first and the last helix and one from the N-terminal
part  of  the first helix to the C-terminus. In plant aspartic proteinases the
two  subdomains  that are connected by the disulfide bridges occur in inversed
order,  these are called "swaposin" domains [5-7]. In these phytepsin proteins
the  two  half  saposin  B-type domains occur in combination with the aspartyl
protease signature (see <PDOC00128>) [3,8].

Some proteins known to contain a saposin B-type domain:

 - Mammalian  proactivator  polypeptide, the saposin precursor (prosapin) that
   is  processed  into  saposins  A,  B,  C  and  D.  Saposins A and C bind as
   activating  cofactors  to beta-glucosylceramidase and galactosylceramidase.
   Saposin   B   facilitates   the   hydrolysis   of  cerebroside  sulfate  by
   arylsulfatase  A.  Saposin  D is a specific sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase
   activator.
 - Mammalian  acid  sphingomyelinase, an enzyme activated by saposins B and D,
   which converts sphingomyelin to ceramide.
 - Mammalian  acyloxyacyl-hydrolase,  an  enzyme  which  removes the secondary
   fatty acyl chains from the lipid A region of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.
 - Mammalian  pulmonary  surfactant-associated  protein  B  (SP-B),  a surface
   tension reducing surfactant secreted by type II epithelial cells.
 - Mammalian   lymfocyte   proteins  NK-lysin  and  granulysin,  antimicrobial
   effector molecules from natural killer cells and T-cells.
 - Entamoeba   histolytica   amoebapores,   membrane-interacting  pore-forming
   proteins with a key role in the pathogenicity of amoeba.
 - Plant  aspartic proteases related to cyprosin and phytepsin. These proteins
   have a peculiar saposin B-type domain where the two halves are "swapped".
 - Dictyostelium discoideum countin, an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphatase and
   a  component  of the secreted counting factor complex (CF) involved in cell
   group size regulation.
 - Mammalian MIR-interacting saposin-like protein (MSAP), a positive regulator
   of neurite outgrowth.

The  profile we developed covers the entire saposin B-type domain and has been
manually  adapted  to  detect  the  two halves of the "swaposin" domain and to
accept inserts like in MSAP.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
