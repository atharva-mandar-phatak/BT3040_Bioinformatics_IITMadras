* HMG boxes A and B DNA-binding domains signature and profile *
***************************************************************

High  mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins are a family of relatively low
molecular  weight  non-histone  components  that  bind  DNA  without  sequence
specificity.  HMG1  (also  called HMG-T in fish) and HMG2 are related proteins
that  have  two  distinguishing  features: two HMG boxes (A and B), homologous
folded  domains  of  around  80  amino  acid  residues, and a long acidic tail
containing 20 to 30 aspartic or glutamic acid residues [1,2]. The HMG box A is
only  found  in  HMG 1 and 2 proteins whereas the HMG box B is also present in
various  transcription  factors.  HMG boxes have unusual DNA binding activity.
They bind preferentially to distorted DNAs, such as four-way junctions, kinked
cisplatin-modified  DNA,  DNA  bulges,  and have the property to bend DNA [2].
They can bind DNA without sequence specificity like in HMG1 and 2 or recognize
a specific site.

Several  structures of HMG-boxes have been solved (see <PDB:1AAB>) [3,4]. They
have a common fold consisting of three alpha helices arranged in an "L-shape".
The  HMG  box binds DNA through its concave face to the minor groove of B-form
DNA and causes bending by partial intercalation of a hydrophobic residue close
to the N-terminus of helix I [4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a HMG box are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic HMG1, HMG2 and related proteins.
 - Animal   sex   determining   region   Y   (SRY)  and  related  proteins,  a
   transcriptional   activator   which  regulates  a  genetic  switch  in male
   development.
 - Animal  SOX family of transcription factors, a conserved family of proteins
   related to the testis-determining factor SRY.
 - Mammalian  lymphoid  enhancer  binding  factor  1 (LEF1), a transcriptional
   activator which regulates a genetic switch in male development.
 - Eukaryotic   structure-specific  recognition  protein  1  (SSRP). It  binds
   specifically  to double-stranded and, at low levels, to single-stranded DNA
   which has been modified by the anticancer drug cisplatin.
 - Mitochondrial  transcription factor 1 (MTF1). It confers selective promoter
   recognition on the core subunit of the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase.
 - Vertebrate  nucleolar  transcription  factors  (UBF1/2). They recognize the
   ribosomal  RNA  gene  promoter  and  activate transcription mediated by RNA
   polymerase I.
 - Yeast  ARS-binding factor (ABF2). It binds specifically to the autonomously
   replicating sequence 1 (ARS1).
 - Yeast transcription factors  IXR1, ROX1, NHP6A/B, SPP41.
 - Drosophila  capicua  protein. A transcription cofactor involved in negative
   regulation of transcription.
 - Fission yeast mismatch binding protein 1 (cmb1). It binds to cytosines
   in base mismatches and opposite chemically altered guanines.
 - Tetrahymena thermophila micronuclear linker histone polyprotein (MIC LH).
 - Mammalian nuclear autoantigen Speckled 100 kDa protein (Sp-100).

The  pattern  we  developed  covers  the  second  helix  of  the HMG box A and
therefore  is  specific  for HMG1/2 proteins. We also developed a profile that
covers the whole domain and recognizes both types of HMG boxes.
