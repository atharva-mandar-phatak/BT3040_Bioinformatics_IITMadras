* Phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase signature *
**************************************************

Phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase (EC 6.3.4.13) (GARS) (phosphoribosylamine
glycine ligase) [1] catalyzes  the second step in  the de novo biosynthesis of
purine, the  ATP-dependent  addition  of  5-phosphoribosylamine  to glycine to
form 5'phosphoribosylglycinamide.

In bacteria GARS is a  monofunctional  enzyme  (encoded by  the purD gene), in
yeast it  is  part, with phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase (AIRS)
of a bifunctional enzyme (encoded by the ADE5,7 gene), in higher eukaryotes it
is part, with AIRS and with phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART)
of a trifunctional enzyme (GARS-AIRS-GART).

The sequence of GARS is well conserved.   As a signature pattern we selected a
highly conserved octapeptide.

-Consensus pattern: R-[LF]-G-D-P-E-x-[EQIM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  with a
 few exceptions.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
