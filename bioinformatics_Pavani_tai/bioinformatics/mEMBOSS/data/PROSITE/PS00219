* Anion exchangers family signatures *
**************************************

Anion exchange is  a cellular  transport function  which  contributes  to  the
regulation  of  cell  pH  and  volume.   Anion  exchangers  are  a  family  of
functionally  related  proteins   that  contributes  to  these  properties  by
maintaining the intracellular level of  the two principal anions: chloride and
HCO3-.

The best characterized anion exchanger is the band 3 protein [1],  which is an
erythrocyte anion exchange membrane glycoprotein. Band 3 is a protein of about
900 amino acids which consists of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of about 400
residues and an  hydrophobic  C-terminal  section  of  about 500 residues that
contains at least ten transmembrane regions.   The cytoplasmic domain provides
binding sites for  cytoskeletal  proteins, while  the integral membrane domain
is responsible for anion transport.

Band 3 protein is specific to erythroid cells, at least two other proteins [2]
structurally  and  functionally  related  to band 3, are found in nonerythroid
tissues:

 - AE2 (or B3 related protein; B3RP), a protein of 1200  residues, which seems
   to be present  in a  variety  of cell types including lymphoid, kidney, and
   choroid plexus.
 - AE3, a protein of 1200 residues, which is specific to neurons.

Structurally AE2 and AE3 are very similar to band 3, the main difference being
an extension of some 300 residues of the N-terminal domain in AE2 and AE3.

We developed two signature  patterns for these proteins.  The first pattern is
based on a conserved stretch of sequence that contains four clustered positive
charged residues and which  is  located  at  the C-terminal extremity  of  the
cytoplasmic  domain,  just  before  the  first  transmembrane segment from the
integral  domain.  The  second  pattern  is  based  on the perfectly conserved
sequence of the  fifth transmembrane segment;  this segment contains a lysine,
which is the  covalent  binding  site for the isothiocyanate group of DIDS, an
inhibitor of anion exchange.

-Consensus pattern: F-G-G-[LIVM](2)-[KR]-D-[LIVM]-[RK]-R-R-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [FI]-L-I-S-L-I-F-I-Y-E-T-F-x-K-L
                    [K is important for anion exchange]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
