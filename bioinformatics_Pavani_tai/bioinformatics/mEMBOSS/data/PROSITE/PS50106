* PDZ domain profile *
**********************

PDZ domains  (also  called  Discs-large  homologous regions (DHR) or GLGF) are
conserved structural  elements  of  80 to 100 amino acids that were originally
identified in  the  post-synaptic density protein PSD-95, the Drosophila tumor
suppressor discs-large,  and  the  tight-junction  protein  ZO-1.  PDZ domains
occur as  single  or, more frequently, as multiple tandemly repeated copies in
a large  and  diverse  set of proteins from all eukaryotes [1,2]. The presence
of one  or  two  copies  of  PDZ  domains in some bacteria may be explained by
horizontal gene transfer [3].

Eukaryotic PDZ domains are multifunctional protein-protein interaction modules
that are  involved in the clustering of signaling molecules and play important
role in organizing  protein  networks on membranes. In many cases, PDZ domains
bind to a signature motif ([FYST]-X-[FVA]) occurring at the very C-terminus of
target proteins.  PDZ  domains  are  also  able  to  form heterodimers, and to
interact with  internal  peptide  fragments of target proteins [1,2,4]. It has
been proposed  that  bacterial PDZ domains also possess C-terminal polypeptide
binding functions [3].

PDZ domains  are  compact globular domains that were originally called GLGF as
Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe is  a  relatively  conserved  element  of their sequences [1].
Resolution of  crystal and solution structures of PDZ domains with and without
ligands has  revealed  that  the  PDZ domain contains six beta-strands and two
alpha-helices [5,6,7,8].  The  C-terminal  motif  of  target proteins has been
shown to  bind in an anti-parallel fashion to a groove formed by the principal
alpha-helix and  the  second beta-strand of the PDZ domains [5,8]. The binding
site involved  in  the  heterodimerization  of  some  PDZ  domains is situated
opposite this  canonical  peptide binding groove. It is an about 30 residue C-
terminal extension  of  the PDZ domain, which forms a beta-hairpin finger. The
first strand  of the beta-hairpin finger mimics a canonical C-terminal peptide
ligand, inserting  into  the peptide binding groove of the PDZ domain from the
partner protein  [7,8].  It  has  been proposed that PDZ domains may bind in a
general fashion  to  non-terminal  sequences, possibly those with beta-finger-
type structures,  regardless  of  whether  or not they are found downstream of
other PDZ domains [9].

Some proteins known to contain a PDZ domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic membrane associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs).
 - Mammalian  amyloid  beta  A4  precursor  protein-binding family A proteins,
   putative function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis by binding to Munc18-1, an
   essential component of the synaptic vesicle exocytotic machinery.
 - Mammalian neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS).
 - Interleukin-16, the only known secreted member of the PDZ protein family.
 - Vertebrate  LIM-kinases  (LIMK),  which  display  serine/threonine-specific
   phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and histone in vitro.
 - Drosophila  and  vertebrate dishevelled (Dsh and Dvl), proteins that play a
   key role  in the transduction of the Wg/Wnt signal from the cell surface to
   the nucleus.
 - Drosophila  InaD,    a  photoreceptor  scaffolding  protein  that assembles
   multiple signal transducing proteins at the membrane via its 5 PDZ domains.
 - Bacillus subtilis stage IV sporulation B protein (spOIVB).
 - Bacterial  gspC  proteins, involved in protein export via type II secretion
   systems.
 - Bacterial  periplasmic  serine  proteases  high-temperature  requirement  A
   (htrA) and tail-specific protease (tsp).
 - Escherichia  coli  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  hypothetical protein YaeL,
   probably associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.

A profile  was  developed  that  covers  the minimal PDZ domain and thus lacks
about 30  C-terminal  residues (which form the beta finger involved in PDZ-PDZ
interactions).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
