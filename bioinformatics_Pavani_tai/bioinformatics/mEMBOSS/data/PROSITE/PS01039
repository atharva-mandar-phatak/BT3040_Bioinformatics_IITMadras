* Bacterial extracellular solute-binding proteins, family 3 signature *
***********************************************************************

Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active  transport of
solutes across  the  cytoplasmic  membrane.  The  protein  components of these
traffic systems  include  one  or two transmembrane protein components, one or
two membrane-associated    ATP-binding   proteins   (ABC   transporters;   see
<PDOC00185>) and a high affinity periplasmic solute-binding protein. The later
are thought  to  bind the substrate in the vicinity of the inner membrane, and
to transfer  it to a complex of inner membrane proteins for concentration into
the cytoplasm.

In gram-positive  bacteria  which are surrounded by a single membrane and have
therefore no  periplasmic  region  the  equivalent  proteins  are bound to the
membrane via an N-terminal lipid anchor. These homolog proteins do not play an
integral role in the transport process per se, but probably serve as receptors
to trigger  or  initiate  translocation of the solute throught the membrane by
binding to  external  sites  of  the  integral membrane proteins of the efflux
system.

In addition  at  least some solute-binding proteins function in the initiation
of sensory transduction pathways.

On the  basis  of  sequence  similarities,  the vast majority of these solute-
binding proteins  can  be  grouped  [1] into eight families of clusters, which
generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.

Family 3  groups  together  specific amino acids and opine-binding periplasmic
proteins and a periplasmic homolog with catalytic activity:

 - Histidine-binding  protein  (gene  hisJ)  of  Escherichia  coli and related
   bacteria. An homologous lipoprotein exists in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
 - Lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding proteins (LAO) (gene argT) of Escherichia
   coli and  related  bacteria  are involved in the same transport system than
   hisJ. Both  solute-binding  proteins  interact with a common membrane-bound
   receptor hisP of the binding protein dependent transport system HisQMP.
 - Glutamine-binding  proteins  (gene  glnH)  of Escherichia coli and Bacillus
   stearothermophilus.
 - Glutamate-binding protein (gene gluB) of Corynebacterium glutamicum.
 - Arginine-binding proteins artI and artJ of Escherichia coli.
 - Nopaline-binding protein (gene nocT) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
 - Octopine-binding protein (gene occT) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
 - Major cell-binding factor (CBF1) (gene: peb1A) from Campylobacter jejuni.
 - Bacteroides nodosus protein aabA.
 - Cyclohexadienyl/arogenate   dehydratase   of   Pseudomonas   aeruginosa,  a
   periplasmic enzyme  which  forms  an  alternative pathway for phenylalanine
   biosynthesis.
 - Escherichia coli protein fliY.
 - Vibrio harveyi protein patH.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydhW.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yckB.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yckK.

The signature pattern is located near the N-terminus of the mature proteins.
