* Tripartite DENN domain profiles *
***********************************

The tripartite  DENN  (after  differentially  expressed  in  neoplastic versus
normal cells)  domain  is  found  in several proteins involved in Rab-mediated
processes or   regulation   of   MAPKs  (Mitogen-activated  preotein  kinases)
signaling pathways.  It  actually consists of three parts as the original DENN
domain is  always  encircled  on  both sides by more divergent domains, called
uDENN (after  upstream  DENN)  and dDENN (for downstream DENN). The tripartite
DENN domain  is  found  associated  with  other  domains,  such  as  RUN  (see
<PDOC50826>), PLAT  (see  <PDOC50095>),  PH (see <PDOC50003>), PPR, WD-40 (see
<PDOC00574>), GRAM  or  C1  (see  <PDOC00379>).  The  function  of DENN domain
remains to date unclear, although it appears to represent a good candidate for
a GTP/GDP exchange activity [1,2].

The general  characteristics  of  DENN  domains  -  three  regions dDENN, DENN
itself, and  uDENN  having  different  patterns  of  sequence conservation and
separated by  sequences of variable length - suggest that they are composed of
at least  three  sub-domains  which  may  feature distinct folds but which are
always associated due to functional and/or structural constraints [1].

Some proteins known to contain a tripartite DENN domain are listed below:

 - Rat Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein (Rab3GEP).
 - Human  mitogen-activated protein kinase activating protein containing death
   domain (MADD). It is orthologous to Rab3GEP.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans  regulator  of  presynaptic  activity  aex-3,  the
   ortholog of Rab3GEP.
 - Mouse Rab6 interacting protein 1 (Rab6IP1).
 - Human SET domain-binding factor 1(SBF1).
 - Human suppressor of tumoreginicity 5 (ST5).
 - Human C-MYC promoter-binding protein IRLB.
