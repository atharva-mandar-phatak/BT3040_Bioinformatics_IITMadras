****************************************************************

Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) [1] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which
is  a  component  of  the  respiratory  chain  complex  and is involved in the
transfer  of  electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme
complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes
it  is  found  in the plasma membrane. In addition to the three large subunits
that form the catalytic center of the enzyme complex there are, in eukaryotes,
a  variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. One of these subunits which
is known as Vb in mammals, V in slime mold and IV in yeast, binds a zinc atom.
The  sequence  of  subunit  Vb  is  well  conserved and includes three to four
conserved cysteines that coordinate the zinc ion [2,3]. Two of these cysteines
are  clustered  in  the  C-terminal  section of the subunit; we have used this
region  as  a  signature  pattern. We also developed a profile that covers the
whole subunit Vb zinc binding region.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-[FYW]-x(10)-C-x(2)-C-G-x(2)-[FY]-K-L
                    [The 2 C's may bind zinc]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: January 2008 / Text revised; profile added.
