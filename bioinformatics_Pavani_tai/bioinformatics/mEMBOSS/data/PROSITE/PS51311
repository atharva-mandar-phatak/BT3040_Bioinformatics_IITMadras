* Secretoglobin (SCGB) family profile *
***************************************

Proteins of   the  secretoglobin  (SCGB)  family  have  the  following  common
characteristics: secretion,  small  size, alpha-helical, and dimeric structure
[1]. The  secretoglobin  monomere structure is composed of four alpha-helices,
H1 to  H4,  that  do  not  form  a  canonical  four  helix-bundle motif, but a
'boomerang'-shaped structure  in  which  helices  H1,  H3,  and  H4  form  the
interface of  a  dimeric  structure  displaying a large oblong internal cavity
(see <PDB:1UTG>).  The  large  cavity,  at  the interface of the two monomers,
joined together  in  an  antiparallel manner, is able to accommodate small- to
medium-sized hydrophobic   ligands   but   its   access   is   sealed  by  two
intermolecular disulfide   bridges  involving  conserved  cysteines  [2-5].  A
schematic representation  of  the  location  of the two disulfide bonds in the
antiparallel dimer is shown below:

Proteins known to be belong to the secretoglobin family are listed below:

 - Uteroglobin  (UTG),  a  steroid-inducible, cytokine-like protein with anti-
   inflammatory and   immunomodulatory   properties.   It  seems  specific  to
   lagomorphes (rabbit, hare, and pica) [3].
 - Clara cell phospholipid-binding protein (CCPBP) (also known as CC10). CCPBP
   is a protein expressed by  non-ciliated cells  of  pulmonary airway surface
   epithelium. Its exact function  is  not  known.  Like uteroglobin, it is an
   inhibitor of   phospholipase   A2.   It   binds   to   phosphatidylcholine,
   phosphatidylinositol and to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) [4].
 - Domestic  cat  major  allergen chain 1 (fel d I-A) and chain 2 (fel d I-B),
   which form  a  heterodimeric  structure.  Fel  DI  contains  an  additional
   disulfide bridge [5].
 - Human mammaglobin, a mammary-specific protein [6].
 - Rat prostatic steroid-binding protein C3 [7].

The profile we developed covers the four alpha-helices of the SCGB monomere.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This profile replaces two patterns whose specificity was inadequate.
-Note: The SCGB family was formerly known as the uteroglobin/Clara cell 10-kDa
 (UTG/CC10) family.

-Last update: April 2007 / Patterns removed, profile added and text revised.
