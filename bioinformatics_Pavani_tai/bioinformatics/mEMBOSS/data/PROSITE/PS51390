* WAP-type 'four-disulfide core' domain profile *
*************************************************

The 'four-disulfide core' or WAP domain comprises 8 cysteine residues involved
in  disulfide  bonds  in  a  conserved  arrangement  [1]. One or more of these
domains   occur   in   whey   acidic   protein   (WAP),   antileukoproteinase,
elastase-inhibitor  proteins and other structurally related proteins which are
listed below.

 - Whey  acidic  protein  (WAP).  WAP  is a major component of milk whey whose
   function  might  be  that  of  a  protease  inhibitor.  WAP consists of two
   'four-disulfide core' domains in most mammals.
 - Antileukoproteinase 1 (HUSI),  a mucous  fluid serine proteinase inhibitor.
   HUSI consists of two 'four-disulfide core' domains.
 - Elafin,  an  elastase-specific  inhibitor  from  human  skin [2,3].
 - Sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitors SPAI-1, -2, and -3 from pig [4].
 - Chelonianin, a protease inhibitor from  the eggs  of  red sea turtle.  This
   inhibitor  consists of  two  domains:  an N-terminal domain which  inhibits
   trypsin and  belongs  to  the  BPTI/Kunitz  family  of  inhibitors,  and  a
   C-terminal domain  which  inhibits subtilisin and is a 'four-disulfide core
   domain'.
 - Extracellular   peptidase   inhibitor  (WDNM1  protein),  involved  in  the
   metastatic potential of adenocarcinomas in rats.
 - Caltrin-like  protein  2  from guinea pig, which inhibits calcium transport
   into spermatozoa.
 - Kallmann  syndrome  protein  (Anosmin-1  or  KALIG-1)  [5,6]. This secreted
   protein  may  be  a  adhesion-like molecule with anti-protease activity. It
   contains a 'four-disulfide core domain' in its N-terminal part.
 - Whey  acidic protein (WAP) from the tammar wallaby, which consists of three
   'four-disulfide core' domains [7].
 - Waprins  from  snake  venom, such as omwaprin from Oxyuranus microlepidotus
   [8] which has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.

The  following  schematic  representation  shows the position of the conserved
cysteines that form the 'four-disulfide core' WAP domain (see <PDB:2REL>).
