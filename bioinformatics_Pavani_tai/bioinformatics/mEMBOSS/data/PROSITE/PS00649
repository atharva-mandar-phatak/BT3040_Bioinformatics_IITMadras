* G-protein coupled receptors family 2 signatures and profiles *
****************************************************************

A number  of  peptide hormones bind to G-protein coupled receptors that, while
structurally similar  to  family  1  of G-protein coupled receptors (R7G) (see
<PDOC00210>), do  not show any similarity at the level of their sequence, thus
representing a new family whose current known members [1,2] are listed below:

 - Calcitonin receptor.
 - Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.
 - Corticotropin releasing factor receptor types 1 and 2.
 - Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor.
 - Glucagon receptor.
 - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor.
 - Growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor.
 - Parathyroid hormone / parathyroid hormone-related peptide types 1 and 2.
 - Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide receptor.
 - Secretin receptor.
 - Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor types 1 and 2.
 - Insects diuretic hormone receptor.

In addition to the above characterized receptors, this family also includes:

 - Caenorhabditis elegans putative receptor C13B9.4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans putative receptor ZK643.3.

 - Leucocyte antigen CD97, a protein that contains, in its N-terminal section,
   3 EGF-like domains (see <PDOC00021>).
 - Cell  surface glycoprotein EMR1, a protein that contains, in its N-terminal
   section, 6 to 7 EGF-like domains (see <PDOC00021>).

All the  characterized receptors are coupled to G-proteins which activate both
adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidylinositol-calcium pathway.

Like family  1  R7G  they  seem  to contain seven transmembrane regions. Their
N-terminus is probably located on the extracellular side of the  membrane  and
potentially glycosylated, while their C-terminus is probably cytoplasmic.

Every receptor  gene  in this family is encoded on multiple exons, and several
of these  genes  are  alternatively  spliced  to  yield  functionally distinct
products.

Family two  G  protein  coupled  receptors  contain a long conserved region in
their N  terminal extracellular part which allow the binding of large peptidic
ligand such  as  glucagon,  secretin,  VIP and PACAP [3]. This region contains
five conserved  cysteines residues which could be involved in disulfide bonds;
we have  developed  a  pattern  in  the  region  that  spans  the  first three
cysteines. We  also  developed  a  profile that covers the whole extracellular
domain.

One of the most highly conserved regions spans the C-terminal part of the last
transmembrane  region and the  beginning of the adjacent intracellular region.
We  have  used  this region as a second signature pattern. We also developed a
profile that spans the seven transmembrane regions.
