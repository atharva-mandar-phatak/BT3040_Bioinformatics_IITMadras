* GATA-type zinc finger domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

The GATA family of transcription factors are proteins  that bind  to DNA sites
with the consensus sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G), found within the regulatory region
of a number of genes. Proteins currently known to belong to this family are:

 - GATA-1 [1] (also known as Eryf1, GF-1 or NF-E1),  which  binds  to the GATA
   region of globin genes and other genes expressed in erythroid cells.  It is
   a transcriptional  activator  which   probably serves as a general 'switch'
   factor for erythroid development.
 - GATA-2 [2], a transcriptional activator which  regulates  endothelin-1 gene
   expression in endothelial cells.
 - GATA-3 [3], a transcriptional activator which  binds to the enhancer of the
   T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes.
 - GATA-4 [4], a transcriptional  activator  expressed in endodermally derived
   tissues and heart.
 - Drosophila protein pannier (or DGATAa) (gene pnr) which acts as a repressor
   of the achaete-scute complex (as-c).
 - Bombyx mori BCFI [5], which regulates the expression of chorion genes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans elt-1 and elt-2, transcriptional activators of genes
   containing the GATA region, including vitellogenin genes [6].
 - Ustilago  maydis  urbs1  [7],  a  protein involved in the repression of the
   biosynthesis of siderophores.
 - Fission yeast protein GAF2.

All these transcription factors contain a pair of highly similar 'zinc finger'
type domains with the consensus sequence C-x2-C-x17-C-x2-C.

Some other proteins contain a single zinc finger motif highly related to those
of the GATA transcription factors. These proteins are:

 - Drosophila  box A-binding factor (ABF) (also known as protein serpent (gene
   srp)) which  may  function  as  a transcriptional activator protein and may
   play a key role in the organogenesis of the fat body.
 - Emericella nidulans areA [8], a  transcriptional  activator  which mediates
   nitrogen metabolite repression.
 - Neurospora crassa nit-2 [9], a transcriptional activator which turns on the
   expression of genes coding for enzymes required for the use of a variety of
   secondary nitrogen sources, during conditions of nitrogen limitation.
 - Neurospora  crassa  white  collar  proteins  1 and 2 (WC-1 and WC-2), which
   control expression of light-regulated genes.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAL81 (or UGA43), a  negative  nitrogen regulatory
   protein.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GLN3, a positive nitrogen regulatory protein.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAT1 to GAT4.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GZF3.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-[DNEHQSTI]-C-x(4,6)-[ST]-x(2)-[WM]-[HR]-
                    [RKENAMSLPGQT]-x(3,4)-[GNEP]-x(3,6)-C-[NES]-[ASNR]-C
                    [The 4 C's are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 GAT2, GAT3 and GAT4.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
