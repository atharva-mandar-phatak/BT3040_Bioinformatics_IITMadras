*****************************************
* Superfamily 3 helicase domain profile *
*****************************************

Helicases  have  been  classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5) [1]. All of the
proteins  bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A
(phosphate-binding   loop   or   P-loop)   (see   <PDOC00017>)  and  Walker  B
(Mg2+-binding  aspartic  acid) motifs [1]. Superfamily 3 consists of helicases
encoded  mainly  by small RNA and DNA viruses and some large nucleocytoplasmic
DNA viruses [2,3]. Small viruses are very dependent on the host-cell machinery
to  replicate.  SF3  helicase  in  small  DNA  viruses  is  associated with an
origin-binding  domain.  By  pairing  a  domain that recognizes the ori with a
helicase,  the  virus  can  bypass  the host-cell-based regulation pathway and
initiate  its  own  replication. The protein binds to the viral ori leading to
origin  unwinding. Cellular replication proteins are then recruited to the ori
and the viral DNA is replicated.

In  SF3 helicases the Walker A and Walker B motifs are separated by spacers of
rather  uniform,  and  relatively  short,  lenght.  In addition to the A and B
motifs  this family is caracterized by a third motif (C) which resides between
the B motif and the C-terminus of the conserved region. This motif consists of
an Asn residue preceded by a run of hydrophobic residues [4].

Several structure of SF3 helicases have been solved (see <PDB:1N25>) [5]. They
all  possess  the  same  core  alpha/beta  fold, consisting of a five-stranded
parallel  beta  sheet  flanked  on  both  sides  by  several alpha helices. In
contrast to SF1 and SF2 helicases, which have RecA-like core folds, the strand
connectivity  within  the alpha/beta core domain is that of AAA+ proteins [6].
The SF3 helicase proteins assemble into a hexameric ring.

Some proteins known to contain an SF3 helicase domain are listed below:

 - Polyomavirus  large  T  antigen. It initiates DNA unwinding and replication
   via interactions with the viral origin of replication.
 - Papillomavirus  E1  protein.  An  ATP-dependent  DNA  helicase required for
   initiation of viral DNA replication.
 - Parvovirus  Rep/NS1  protein,  which is also required for the initiation of
   viral replication.
 - Poxviridae and other large DNA viruses D5 protein.
 - Bacteriophage  DNA primase/helicase protein.
 - Bacterial prophage DNA primase/helicase protein.
 - ssRNA positive strand viruses RNA1 polyprotein.

To  recognize  this  domain  we  have developed two profiles. The first one is
directed  against  DNA viruses SF3 helicase and the second one is specific for
ssRNA positive-strand viruses SF3 helicase.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
