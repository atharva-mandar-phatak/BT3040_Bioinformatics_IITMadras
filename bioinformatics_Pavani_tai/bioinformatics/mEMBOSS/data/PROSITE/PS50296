* Translation initiation factor SUI1 profile *
**********************************************

In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),  SUI1 is a translation initiation
factor that  functions  in  concert  with  eIF-2 and the initiator tRNA-Met in
directing the  ribosome to the proper start site of translation [1]. SUI1 is a
protein of  108  residues.  Close  homologs  of  SUI1  have  been found [2] in
mammals, insects and plants.

SUI1 is also evolutionary related to:

 - Hypothetical  proteins  from  bacteria  such  as Escherichia coli (yciH) or
   Haemophilus influenzae (HI1225).
 - Hypothetical   proteins  from  archaea  such  as  Methanococcus  jannaschii
   (MJ0463).

Two eukaryotic proteins  also  seem  to contain a C-terminal SUI1-like domain.
These are:

 - Density-regulated  protein  (gene: DENR). This protein is found in mammals,
   insects, nematodes, plants and fungi.
 - Ligatin (gene: LGTN). This protein is found in mammals and insects.

The profile we developed covers the entire C-terminal SUI1-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
