* Eukaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signature *
******************************************************

A number of   different  eukaryotic  oxidoreductases  that require  and bind a
molybdopterin cofactor have  been shown [1] to share a few regions of sequence
similarity. These enzymes are:

 - Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.17.1.4),  which  catalyzes  the   oxidation of
   xanthine to uric acid with  the concomitant reduction of NAD. Structurally,
   this enzyme  of about 1300 amino acids consists of at least three  distinct
   domains: an   N-terminal  2Fe-2S ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur binding domain
   (see <PDOC00175>),  a  central  FAD/NAD-binding domain and a C-terminal Mo-
   pterin domain.
 - Aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1), which catalyzes the oxidation aldehydes into
   acids. Aldehyde  oxidase is highly similar to xanthine dehydrogenase in its
   sequence and domain structure.
 - Nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.1.1), which  catalyzes  the  reduction of nitrate
   to nitrite.  Structurally, this enzyme of about 900 amino acids consists of
   an N-terminal Mo-pterin domain,  a central cytochrome b5-type  heme-binding
   domain (see <PDOC00170>)  and  a   C-terminal  FAD/NAD-binding   cytochrome
   reductase domain.
 - Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), which  catalyzes  the oxidation of sulfite to
   sulfate. Structurally, this enzyme of about 460 amino acids  consists of an
   N-terminal cytochrome b5-binding domain followed by a Mo-pterin domain.

There are a few conserved regions in the sequence of the molybdopterin-binding
domain of  these enzymes. The pattern we use to detect these proteins is based
on one  of  them.  It  contains  a cysteine residue which could be involved in
binding the molybdopterin cofactor.
