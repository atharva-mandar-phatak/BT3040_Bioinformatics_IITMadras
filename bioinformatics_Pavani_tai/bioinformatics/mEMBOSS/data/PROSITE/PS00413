* Neuromodulin (GAP-43) signatures *
************************************

Neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43, pp46, B-50, F1, and P-57) [1] is an axonal
membrane protein associated with nerve growth.  It is a major component of the
motile growth cones that form the tips of elongating axons. Neuromodulin is an
hydrophilic protein of 210 to 240 amino acid residues,  which binds calmodulin
and  inhibits  phosphatidylinositol  phosphate  kinase  (PIP kinase).    It is
phosphorylated by protein  kinase C,  and regulates the binding of GTP to G(0)
[2]. Neuromodulin contains an IQ motif (see <PDOC50096>).

Two functionally important  regions  of GAP-43 have been characterized: the N-
terminal  extremity of  the protein  contains two cysteine residues  which are
palmitoylated  and  are  responsible  for the attachment of the protein to the
membrane; about forty residues downstream  is  a serine  residue  which can be
phosphorylated  by  protein  kinase C [3]  and   which  is  adjacent  to   the
calmodulin-binding domain.  We have  selected  those two regions as  signature
patterns.

-Consensus pattern: <M-L-C-C-[LIVM]-R-R
                    [The 2 C's are palmitoylated]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: S-F-R-G-H-I-x-R-K-K-[LIVM]
                    [S is phosphorylated]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
