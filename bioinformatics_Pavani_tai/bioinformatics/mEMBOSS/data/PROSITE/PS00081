* Lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain signatures and profile *
*********************************************************************

Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.-) are a class of iron-containing dioxygenases which
catalyzes   the   hydroperoxidation   of  lipids,  containing  a  cis,cis-1,4-
pentadiene  structure. The primary products are hydroperoxy fatty acids, which
usually  are  rapidly reduced to hydroxy derivatives. Lipoxygenases are common
in  plants  where they may be involved in a number of diverse aspects of plant
physiology  including  growth and development, pest resistance, and senescence
or  responses  to  wounding [1]. In mammals a number of lipoxygenases isozymes
are  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  prostaglandins  and  leukotrienes [2].
Lipoxygenases are also common in primitive animals such as coral [3] and occur
in  some  bacteria  [4,5]. The N-terminal part of the eukaryotic lipoxygenases
contains   a   PLAT   domain   (see  <PDOC50095>)  that  may  be  involved  in
membrane-binding  or  substrate  acquisition, while the iron-binding catalytic
domain forms the C-terminal part.

The  3D structure of the catalytic domain is mainly alpha-helical with an iron
in  the active site (see <PDB:1F8N>). The center of the domain consists of two
long  helices, which contain four of the iron-binding residues (at least three
of  which  are  histidines).  A  fifth  residue  that coordinates the non-heme
catalytic  iron is the carboxylate of the C-terminal isoleucine. The mammalian
catalytic  domain  has a length of ~550-600 residues, which is shorter than in
the  plant  lipoxygenases and forms a more compact structure as the additional
100-150 amino acids in plant enzymes form extra loops [3,6,7].

Some proteins known to contain a lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain:

 - Plant lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.12). Plants express a variety  of cytosolic
   isozymes as well as what seems [8] to be a chloroplast isozyme.
 - Mammalian arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.34).
 - Mammalian arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.31).
 - Mammalian erythroid cell-specific 15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).
 - Coral  (Plexaura  homomalla)  allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase protein, a
   bifunctional   enzyme   including   both   a  peroxidase  and  arachidonate
   8-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.40).
 - Pseudomonas   aeruginosa   oleic   acid   lipoxygenase   and   arachidonate
   15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).

Six  histidines are strongly conserved in lipoxygenase sequences, five of them
are  found  clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids. This region contains two
of  the  three  iron-ligands;  the  other histidines have been shown [9] to be
important  for the activity of lipoxygenases. As signatures for this family of
enzymes  we have selected two patterns in the region of the histidine cluster.
The first pattern contains the first three conserved histidines and the second
pattern  includes  the  fourth and the fifth. We also developed a profile that
covers the entire lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain.
