* UBX domain profile *
**********************

Covalent modification of proteins by the small, evolutionary conserved protein
ubiquitin (see  <PDOC00271>)  plays  a  central  role in a variety of cellular
processes, including  bulk  protein  degradation,  cell-cycle  control, stress
response, DNA  repair,  signal  transduction,  transcriptional  regulation and
vesicular traffic. A cascade of three enzymes (called E1, E2 and E3) catalyzes
the conjugation  of  ubiquitin  to  lysine  side-chains  of  target  proteins.
Ubiquitination is  a  reversible  process: several specific ubiquitin carboxy-
terminal hydrolases   (UBPs)  (see  <PDOC00750>)  can  remove  ubiquitin  from
proteins. The  variety  of  cellular  processes  regulated  by  ubiquitination
demands a  high  substrate specificity of the ubiquitination machinery as well
as the  existence  of  diverse  downstream  effector proteins interacting with
ubiquitinated substrates.  Most  of these cellular effectors are characterized
by a  modular  composition  of  ubiquitin-binding  motifs  and further domains
mediating specific functions. The UBX domain is an about 80 amino acid residue
module of  unknown  function  present  typically at the carboxyl terminus of a
variety of  eukaryotic  proteins.  It  was  originally identified in the human
hypothetical 33.4  kDa  protein,  a member of the UBA domain (see <PDOC50030>)
family of  proteins  implicated in ubiquitination processes. The UBX domain is
found also  in  a number of different proteins that so far appear unrelated to
processes involving  ubiquitination, including FAS-associated factor-1 (FAF1),
p47 and Rep8, as well as in several proteins of unknown function. As only very
few UBX  domain proteins have been studied in details, no general function for
the UBX domain has yet emerged [1,2].

The resolution  of the three dimensional of the UBX domain of human FAF1 shows
a beta-Grasp  fold  characterized  by  a  beta-beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta
secondary-structure organization  (see  <PDB:1H8C>).  The strands are arranged
into a   mixed  five-stranded  beta  sheet  in  the  order  21534.  The  three
dimensional structure   of   the   UBX   domain  reveals  a  close  structural
relationship with  ubiquitin despite the lack of significant sequence homology
[1].

Some proteins known to contain an UBX domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  FAS-associated  factor  1 (FAF1). It specifically interacts with
   the cytoplasmic domain of FAS.
 - Mammalian  P97/VCP  associated  protein  p47,  involved in homotypic ER and
   Golgi fusion control.
 - Mammalian UBX domain-containing protein 1 (UBXD1).
 - Human hypothetical 33.4 kDa protein (Y33K).
 - Human reproduction 8 protein (rep-8).
 - Human undulin 2, a matrix glycoprotein.
 - Yeast SHP1 protein.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YBR273C, YDL091C, YDR330W, YJL048C, YMR067C.
