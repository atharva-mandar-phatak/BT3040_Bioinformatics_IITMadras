**********************************

Porphyromonas gingivalis  collagenase  (gene  prtC)  [1]  is  an  enzyme  that
degrades type  I  collagen and that seems to require a metal cofactor. PrtC is
evolutionary related to a number of uncharacterized proteins:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydcP.
 - Escherichia coli  hypothetical protein yegQ, and HI0419,  the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhbU.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0169.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0090.

A well conserved region containing two cysteines can be used as a signature
pattern for these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: E-x-F-x(2)-G-[SA]-[LIVM]-C-x(4)-G-x-C-x-[LIVM]-S
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family U32 in the classification of peptidases
 [E1].
