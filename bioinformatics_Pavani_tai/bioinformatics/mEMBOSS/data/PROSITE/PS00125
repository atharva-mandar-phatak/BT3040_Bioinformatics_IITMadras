************************************************************

Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases  (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP) [1,2,3] are
enzymes that catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a serine or
a threonine  residue.  They  are  very  important in controlling intracellular
events in  eukaryotic  cells.  In mammalian tissues four different types of PP
have been  identified  and  are  known as PP1, PP2A, PP2B and PP2C. Except for
PP2C, these enzymes are evolutionary related.

 - Protein  phosphatase-1  (PP1)  is  an  enzyme  of broad specificity.  It is
   inhibited by  two  thermostable  proteins,  inhibitor-1 and -2. In mammals,
   there are  two  closely  related  isoforms of PP-1: PP-1alpha and PP-1beta,
   produced by  alternative splicing of the same gene. In Emericella nidulans,
   PP-1 (gene  bimG)  plays  an important role in mitosis control by reversing
   the action  of  the  nimA kinase. In yeast, PP-1 (gene SIT4) is involved in
   dephosphorylating the large subunit of RNA polymerase II.
 - Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is also an enzyme of broad specificity.  PP2A
   is a trimeric enzyme that consist of a core composed of a catalytic subunit
   associated with a 65 Kd regulatory subunit and a third variable subunit. In
   mammals, there are two closely  related isoforms  of  the catalytic subunit
   of PP2A: PP2A-alpha and PP2A-beta, encoded by separate genes.
 - Protein phosphatase-2B  (PP2B or calcineurin), a  calcium-dependent  enzyme
   whose activity is stimulated by calmodulin. It is composed of two subunits:
   the catalytic A-subunit and the calcium-binding B-subunit.  The specificity
   of PP2B is restricted.

In addition to the above-mentioned  enzymes, some  additional serine/threonine
specific protein phosphatases have been characterized and are listed below.

 - Mammalian phosphatase-X (PP-X), and  Drosophila  phosphatase-V (PP-V) which
   are closely related but yet distinct from PP2A.
 - Yeast  phosphatase  PPH3,  which  is  similar  to  PP2A, but with different
   enzymatic properties.
 - Drosophila  phosphatase-Y  (PP-Y),  and yeast phosphatases Z1 and Z2 (genes
   PPZ1 and PPZ2) which are closely related but yet distinct from PP1.
 - Drosophila  retinal  degeneration  protein C (gene rdgC), a calcium-binding
   phosphatase required to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration.
 - Phages Lambda and Phi-80 ORF-221  which have been shown to have phosphatase
   activity and are related to mammalian PP's.

The best   conserved   regions   in  these  proteins  is  a  highly  conserved
pentapeptide that can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMN]-[KR]-G-N-H-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
