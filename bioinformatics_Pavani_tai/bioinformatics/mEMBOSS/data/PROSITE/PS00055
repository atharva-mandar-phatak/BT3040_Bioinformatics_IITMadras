* Ribosomal protein S12 signature *
***********************************

Ribosomal protein S12 is one of the proteins from the small ribosomal subunit.
In Escherichia coli, S12 is known to be involved in the translation initiation
step. It  is  a  very  basic  protein  of  120 to 150 amino-acid residues. S12
belongs to  a  family  of  ribosomal  proteins which, on the basis of sequence
similarities [1], groups:

 - Eubacterial S12.
 - Archaebacterial S12.
 - Algal and plant chloroplast S12.
 - Cyanelle S12.
 - Protozoa and plant mitochondrial S12.
 - Yeast S28.
 - Drosophila mitochondrial protein tko (Technical KnockOut).
 - Mammalian S23.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  the  best  conserved regions in these
proteins, located in the center of each sequence.

-Consensus pattern: [RK]-x-P-N-S-[AR]-x-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for some mitochondrial S12 and Micrococcus luteus S12.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1995 / Text revised.
