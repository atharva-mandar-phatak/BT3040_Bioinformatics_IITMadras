* EngC GTPase domain profile *
******************************

GTPases function   as  crucial  molecular  switches  in  a  broad  variety  of
biochemical processes.   The   majority  of  GTPases  form  a  vast  class  of
evolutionarily related  proteins  within  the  superclass of P-loop-containing
ATPases (see  <PDOC00017>).  The  P-loop  GTPases share a conserved amino acid
sequence G1-G3-G4  motif  pattern  (G2 is a less conserved motif found only in
some GTPases)  present in the GTPase domain. The Escherichia coli protein engC
represents a  protein  family  whose members are broadly conserved in bacteria
and have  been shown to be indispensable to the growth of E. coli and Bacillus
subtilis. The  engC  protein  is  an  unusual, circularly permuted GTPase that
catalyzes rapid  hydrolysis of GTP with comparatively slow catalytic turnover.
The GTPase domain of engC is highly similar to several P-loop GTPases, but has
an altered  connectivity  of  the structural elements and associated conserved
motifs relative  to the typical P-loop-containing GTPase domain. Specifically,
engC and  its  orthologs  have  a circular permutation of the GTPase structure
described by   a  G4-G1-G3  pattern  [1].  The  engC  type  GTPase  domain  is
predominantly bacterial, with probable acquisition by plants from chloroplasts
[2].

The profile we developed covers the entire engC type GTPase domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
