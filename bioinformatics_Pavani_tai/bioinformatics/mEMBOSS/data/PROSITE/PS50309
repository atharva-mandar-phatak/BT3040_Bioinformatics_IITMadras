* Doublecortin domain profile *
*******************************

X-linked lissencephaly   is  a  severe  brain  malformation  affecting  males.
Recently it  has been demonstrated that the doublecortin gene is implicated in
this disorder   [1].  Doublecortin  was  found  to  bind  to  the  microtubule
cytoskeleton. In  vivo  and  in vitro assays show that Doublecortin stabilizes
microtubules and  causes bundling [2]. Doublecortin is a basic protein with an
iso-electric point  of  10,  typical of microtubule-binding proteins. However,
its sequence contains no known microtubule-binding domain(s).

The detailed  sequence analysis of Doublecortin and Doublecortin-like proteins
allowed the  identification  of  an evolutionarily conserved Doublecortin (DC)
domain. This domain is found in the N-terminus of proteins and consists of one
or two tandemly repeated copies of an around 80 amino acids region [3]. It has
been suggested  that  the  first DC domain of Doublecortin  binds  tubulin and
enhances microtubule polymerization [3].

Some proteins known to contain a DC domain are listed below:

 - Doublecortin.  It is required for neuronal migration [1]. A large number of
   point mutations  in the human DCX gene leading to lissencephaly are located
   within the DC domains [3].
 - Human serine/threonine-protein kinase DCAMKL1. It is a probable kinase that
   may be   involved   in  a  calcium-signaling  pathway  controling  neuronal
   migration in the developing brain [4].
 - Retinitis pigmentosa 1 protein. It could play a role in the differentiation
   of photoreceptor  cells.  Mutation  in  the  human RP1 gene cause retinitis
   pigmentosa of type 1 [5].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
