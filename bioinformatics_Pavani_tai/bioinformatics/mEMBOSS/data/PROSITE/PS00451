* Pathogenesis-related proteins Bet v I family signature *
**********************************************************

A number of plant proteins, which  all seem to be involved in pathogen defense
response, are structurally related [1,2,3]. These proteins are:

 - Bet v I,  the major pollen allergen from white birch.  Bet v I is  the main
   cause of type I allergic reactions in Europe, North America and USSR.
 - Aln g I, the major pollen allergen from alder.
 - Api G I, the major allergen from celery.
 - Car b I, the major pollen allergen from hornbeam.
 - Cor a I, the major pollen allergen from hazel.
 - Mal d I, the major pollen allergen from apple.
 - Asparagus wound-induced protein AoPR1.
 - Kidney bean pathogenesis-related proteins 1 and 2.
 - Parsley pathogenesis-related proteins PR1-1 and PR1-3.
 - Pea disease resistance response proteins pI49, pI176 and DRRG49-C.
 - Pea abscisic acid-responsive proteins ABR17 and ABR18.
 - Potato pathogenesis-related proteins STH-2 and STH-21.
 - Soybean stress-induced protein SAM22.

These proteins  are  thought  to be intracellularly located. They contain from
155 to  160  amino  acid  residues.  As  a  signature  pattern,  we selected a
conserved region located in the third quarter of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(2)-[LIVMF]-x(4)-E-x(2,3)-[CSTAENV]-x(8,9)-[GNDS]-
                    [GS](2)-[CS]-x(2)-[KT]-x(4)-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
