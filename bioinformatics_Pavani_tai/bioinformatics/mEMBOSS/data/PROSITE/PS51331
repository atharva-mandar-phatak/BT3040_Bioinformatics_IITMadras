* Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (thyX) domain profile *
***************************************************************

All cellular  organisms  need  thymidylate (dTMP) for the replication of their
chromosomes, as  dTMP  is  required  for  the biosynthesis of dTTP, a building
block of  DNA.  Cells  can  produce  thymidylate  either  de novo from dUMP or
incorporate thymidine  using  thymidine  kinase.  The  de novo pathway of dTMP
synthesis requires  a  specific  enzyme, thymidylate synthase, that methylates
dUMP at   position   5   of   the   pyrimidine   ring.  Two  structurally  and
mechanistically distinct  classes  of  thymidylate  synthases  exist. The well
studied thyA   proteins  (EC  2.1.1.45)  catalyze  the  reductive  methylation
reaction of  dUMP, with methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)H(4)folate) serving as
one-carbon donor  and  as  source of reductive power (see <PDOC00086>). On the
other hand  the  thyX  (EC 2.1.1.148) family of thymidylate synthases contains
FAD that  is tightly bound by a novel fold. FAD mediates hydride transfer from
NADPH during  catalysis.  Consequently,  in  the  reaction  catalyzed by thyX,
CH(2)H(4)folate serves  only  as  a carbon donor and tetrahydrofolate (and not
dihydrofolate as in the case of thyA) is produced [1,2].

The thyX  domain consists of a central alpha/beta domain and two alpha helices
located away  from  the central domain (see <PDB:1KQ4>). The central domain is
made up of a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, flanked by 6 alpha-helices
on one  side  of  the  sheet  [2-4].  Sequence  alignments revealed a specific
sequence motif  R-H-R-X(7)-S  (thyX  motif)  common to this family of proteins
[1].

The profile we developed covers the entire thyX domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: ThyX   proteins  are  also  known  as  thy1  or  thymidilate  synthase-
 complementing proteins [1,4].
