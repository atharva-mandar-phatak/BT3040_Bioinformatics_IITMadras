* Aspartate and ornithine carbamoyltransferases signature *
***********************************************************

Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) (ATCase)  catalyzes the conversion
of aspartate and  carbamoyl  phosphate to carbamoylaspartate,  the second step
in the de  novo  biosynthesis of  pyrimidine nucleotides [1].  In  prokaryotes
ATCase  consists  of  two  subunits:  a  catalytic  chain  (gene pyrB)  and  a
regulatory chain (gene pyrI), while  in  eukaryotes it is a domain in a multi-
functional enzyme  (called URA2 in yeast,  rudimentary  in Drosophila, and CAD
in mammals [2]) that  also  catalyzes  other  steps  of  the  biosynthesis  of
pyrimidines.

Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) (OTCase)  catalyzes the conversion
of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate  to citrulline.   In  mammals this enzyme
participates  in the    urea cycle  [3] and  is  located  in the mitochondrial
matrix.  In prokaryotes and  eukaryotic  microorganisms it  is involved in the
biosynthesis of arginine. In some bacterial species it is also involved in the
degradation of arginine [4] (the arginine deaminase pathway).

It has been  shown [5] that these two  enzymes  are evolutionary related.  The
predicted secondary structure of both enzymes are  similar  and there are some
regions   of  sequence similarities.    One  of these   regions includes three
residues which  have   been shown, by  crystallographic   studies   [6], to be
implicated   in binding the phosphoryl group   of carbamoyl phosphate. We have
selected this region as a signature for these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: F-x-[EK]-x-S-[GT]-R-T
                    [S, R, and the 2nd T bind carbamoyl phosphate]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The residue in position 3 of the  pattern allows to distinguish between
 an ATCase (Glu) and an OTCase (Lys).
