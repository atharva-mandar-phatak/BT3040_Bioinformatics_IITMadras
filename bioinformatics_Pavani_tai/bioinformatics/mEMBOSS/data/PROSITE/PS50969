* FCP1 homology domain profile *
********************************

Yeast FCP1    is   an  essential protein serine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) that
dephosphorylates the  C-terminal  domain  (CTD)  of  RNA  polymerase  II. FCP1
orthologs are  present in all known eukaryote proteomes. The N-terminal domain
of FCP1  corresponds  to  the  catalytic  unit of the phosphatase and has been
refered to  as  the FCP1 homology domain. The FCP1 homology domain, which is a
~180-residue module, is also found in many other proteins of unknown function.
It contains   a   DxDx(T/V)   motif  preceded  by  four  hydrophobic  residues
characteristic of  a  large  family  of  metal-dependent phosphohydrolases and
phosphotransferases.  The  first aspartate residue  is  likely  to participate
in catalysis,  whereas  the  second could have a role in substrate recognition
[1,2,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire FCP1 homology domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
