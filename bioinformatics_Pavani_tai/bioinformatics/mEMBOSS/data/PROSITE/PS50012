* Regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) signatures and profile *
**********************************************************************

The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) [1]  is  a  eukaryotic protein
which binds  to  chromatin  and  interacts  with  ran,  a  nuclear GTP-binding
protein (see <PDOC00859>),  to promote the loss of bound GDP and the uptake of
fresh GTP,  thus  acting as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator (GDS)
[2]. The  interaction of RCC1 with ran probably plays an important role in the
regulation of gene expression.

RCC1, known  as    PRP20  or  SRM1  in yeast, pim1 in fission yeast and BJ1 in
Drosophila, is  a  protein  that  contains seven tandem repeats of a domain of
about 50   to   60   amino   acids.   As  shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation, the  repeats  make  up  the  major  part  of the length of the
protein. Outside the repeat region, there is just a small N-terminal domain of
about 40  to  50  residues  and,  in the Drosophila protein only, a C-terminal
domain of about 130 residues.

                                                                 In Drosophila

RCC1 repeats are also found in the following proteins:

 - Mammalian  retinitis  pigmentosa  GTPase regulator (RPGR) [3]. Mutations in
   the RPGR  gene  cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa type 3 (RP3), a severe,
   progressive and  degenerative  retinal   dystrophy  eventually  leading  to
   complete blindness.
 - Mammalian HERC2 protein. A putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor that
   could be involved in protein trafficking.

We developed  two  signature patterns for RCC1.  The  first is found in the N-
terminal part  of  the second repeat; this is the most conserved part of RCC1.
The second  is derived from conserved positions in the C-terminal part of each
repeat and detects up to five copies of the repeated domain. We also developed
a profile that covers the whole repeat.

-Consensus pattern: G-x-N-D-x(2)-[AV]-L-G-R-x-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFA]-[STAGC](2)-G-x-{TAV}-H-[STAGLI]-[LIVMFA]-{KI}-
                    [LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 65, in which  the pattern  is found
 only ONCE,  while   it is found from two to five times in the members of this
 family.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
