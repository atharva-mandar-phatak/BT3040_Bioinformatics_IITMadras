* Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase 20 Kd subunit signature *
****************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located in  the  inner mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there is  one with a molecular  weight of  20  Kd (in mammals) [3], which is a
component of  the  iron-sulfur (IP) fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind a
4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster. The 20 Kd subunit has been found to be:

 - Nuclear encoded, as a precursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and
   in Neurospora crassa.
 - Mitochondrial encoded in Paramecium (gene psbG).
 - Chloroplast encoded in various higher plants (gene ndhK or psbG).

The 20 Kd subunit is highly similar to [4]:

 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 proteins psbG1 and psbG2.
 - Subunit B of Escherichia coli NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoB).
 - Subunit NQO6 of Paracoccus denitrificans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
 - Subunit 7 of Escherichia coli formate hydrogenlyase (gene hycG).
 - Subunit I of Escherichia coli hydrogenase-4 (gene hyfI).

As as signature pattern we selected a highly  conserved region, located in the
central section  of  this subunit and which contains a conserved cysteine that
is probably involved in the binding of the 4Fe-4S center.

-Consensus pattern: [GN]-x-[DE]-[KRHST]-[LIVMFA]-[LIVMF]-P-[IV]-D-[LIVMFYWA]-
                    [LIVMFYWK]-x-P-x-C-P-[PT]
                    [The C may be a 4Fe-4S ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
