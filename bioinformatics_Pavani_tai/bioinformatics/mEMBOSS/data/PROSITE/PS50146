* DAG-kinase catalytic (DAGKc) domain profile *
***********************************************

The  DAG-kinase catalytic domain or DAGKc domain is present in mammalian lipid
kinases,  such  as  diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide and sphingosine kinases, as
well  as  in  related  bacterial  proteins  [1,2].  Eukaryotic  DAG-kinase (EC
2.7.1.107)  catalyzes  the  phosphorylation  of DAG to phosphatidic acid, thus
modulating  the  balance  between  the  two  signaling  lipids.  At  least ten
different  isoforms  have  been  identified  in  mammals,  which form 5 groups
characterized  by different functional domains, such as the calcium-binding EF
hand   (see   <PDOC00018>),  PH  (see  <PDOC50003>),  SAM  (see  <PDOC50105>),
DAG/PE-binding   C1   domain   (see  <PDOC00379>)  and  ankyrin  repeats  (see
<PDOC50088>) [3].

In bacteria, an integral membrane DAG kinase forms a homotrimeric protein that
lacks  the  DAGKc  domain  (see  <PDOC00820>). In contrast, the bacterial yegS
protein  is  a soluble cytosolic protein that contains the DAGKc domain in the
N-terminal  part.  YegS is a lipid kinase with two structural domains, wherein
the  active  site is located in the interdomain cleft, C-terminal to the DAGKc
domain  which  forms an alpha/beta fold (see <PDB: 2BON; A>) [2]. The tertiary
structure  resembles  that of NAD kinases and contains a metal-binding site in
the C-terminal region [2,4].

Some proteins known to contain a DAGKc domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  diacylglycerol  kinase (DGK/DAGK, EC 2.7.1.107), which upon cell
   stimulation   converts   the   second  messenger  DAG  into  phosphatidate,
   initiating the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositols and attenuating protein
   kinase C activity.
 - Mammalian   sphingosine   kinase   (EC   2.7.1.91),   which  catalyzes  the
   phosphorylation  of  sphingosine  to  form sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a
   lipid mediator with both intra- and extracellular functions.
 - Mammalian  mitochondrial  acylglycerol  kinase (mulK, EC 2.7.1.94), a lipid
   kinase  that  can phosphorylate both monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to
   form lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively.
 - Mammalian  ceramide kinase (EC 2.7.1.138), which catalyzes specifically the
   phosphorylation of ceramide to form ceramide 1-phosphate.
 - Bacterial  lipid  kinase  yegS  (EC 2.7.1.-), which in vitro phosphorylates
   phosphatidylglycerol   but   not  diacylglycerol;  probably  phosphorylates
   lipids.
 - Fruit fly diacylglycerol kinases (EC 2.7.1.107).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative diacylglycerol kinase K06A1.6 and protein
   F52C9.3
 - Plant sphingoid long-chain bases kinase.
 - Yeast sphingoid long-chain bases kinase.

The profile we developed covers the entire DAGKc domain.
