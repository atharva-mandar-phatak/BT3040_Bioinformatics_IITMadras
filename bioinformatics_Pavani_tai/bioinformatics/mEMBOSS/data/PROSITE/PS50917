* SPOC domain profile *
***********************

Split end (spen) proteins have been identified in worms, flies and vertebrates
and appear  to  play a similar role in each organism: they regulate expression
of key  transcriptional effectors in diverse signaling pathways. Spen proteins
vary widely  in size (90-600 kDa), but are nevertheless characterized by three
repeated N-terminal  RNA  recognition  motifs  (RRMs)  (see <PDOC00030>) and a
highly conserved  C-terminal SPOC domain (Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal
domain), of  ~165  amino  acids  [1]. It has been suggested that Spen proteins
play an  essential role in regulating transcriptional repression, and that the
conserved function   of  the  SPOC  domain  is  to  mediate  interaction  with
corepressors [2].

The SPOC  domain  is folded into a single compact domain consisting of a beta-
barrel with  seven  strands  framed  by six alpha helices (see <PDB:1OW1>). It
appears to  be  ideally  suited  to  mediate  interaction  with other proteins
through a  number  of  deep  grooves  and clefts in the surface as well as two
nonpolar loops. Most significantly, the structure reveals a highly basic patch
on the  surface,  which  is  absolutely  conserved throughout the Spen protein
family. This  basic  patch  has  been  shown to mediate the tight and specific
interaction of  the SPOC domain of the human transcriptional corepressor SHARP
with the   conserved   acidic   C-terminal   LSD   motif  from  the  SMRT/NCoR
corepressors. Of  the  residues conserved across the whole family, most lie on
the molecular surface rather than in the core [2].

Some proteins known to contain a SPOC domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila  split ends (spen). It promotes sclerite development in the head
   region and represses head-like sclerite development in the thorax.
 - Mouse  MINT  (Msx2  intercating nuclear target). It is involved in skeletal
   and neuronal   development  by  mediating  repression  by  the  homeodomain
   transcriptional repressor Msx2.
 - Human SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein), the homolog of MINT.

The profile we developed covers the entire SPOC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
