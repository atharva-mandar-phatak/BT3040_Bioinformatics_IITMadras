* RWD domain profile *
**********************

The RWD  domain  is a conserved region of about 110 amino acid residues, which
has been  identified  in  the  mouse  GCN2  eIF2alpha kinase and histidyl-tRNA
synthetase and in presumed orthologs in other eukaryotic species from yeast to
vertebrates. Additionally,  it is also found in WD repeat containing proteins,
yeast DEAD  (DEXD)-like  helicases,  many RING-finger containing proteins, the
UPF0029 uncharacterized  protein  family  (see  <PDOC00707>)  and  a  range of
hypothetical proteins.  The  RWD  domain  has  been  named  after  the  better
characterized RING  finger (see <PDOC00449>) and WD repeat containing proteins
(see <PDOC00574>)  and  DEAD-like  helicaces  (see  <PDOC00039>).  It has been
proposed that the RWD domain might have a function in protein interaction [1].

The RWD  domain  is predicted to have an alpha/beta secondary structure and is
thought to be related to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCc) domain, although
the catalytic  cysteine  critical  for  ubiquitin-conjugating  activity is not
conserved in most members of the novel subfamily [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire RWD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
