* Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme signature *
**********************************************

Ornithine decarboxylase  antizyme  (ODC-AZ)  [1]  binds  to, and destabilizes,
ornithine decarboxylase  (ODC),  a  key  enzyme in polyamine synthesis. ODC is
then rapidly degraded. The expression of ODC-AZ requires programmed, ribosomal
frameshifting which  is  modulated  according to the cellular concentration of
polyamines.  High levels of polyamines induce a +1 ribosomal frameshift in the
translation of  mRNA  for  the  antizyme  leading to the expression of a full-
length protein.

At least  three forms  of ODC-AZ exist in mammals [2] and the protein has been
found in  Drosophila  (protein  Gutfeeling), nematodes and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe [3].

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  highly  conserved region in the C-
terminal part of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LT]-L-E-[FY]-[AVC]-[DE]-[DE]-[KNQHT]-[LMT]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for S.pombe.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
