* GAR domain profile *
**********************

The Gas2-related  (GAR) domain was named after Gas2 (growth arrest specific 2)
and is common in plakin family members and Gas2 family members. The GAR domain
comprises ~57 amino acids and has been shown to bind to microtubules [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a GAR domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Gas2,  a  cytoskeletal  protein  that  is  highly upregulated in
   growth-arrested fibroblasts.
 - Mammalian Gas2-related on chromosome 22 (GAR22).
 - Mammalian MACF, a protein that can associate with both actin microfilaments
   and microtubules.
 - Mammalian bullous pemphigoid 1 (BPAG1).
 - Drosophila  Kakapo/Shortstop,  a  microtubule  and  microfilament organizer
   important for  axonal  outgrowth, local dendritic extension and maintaining
   the integrity of cell layers.
 - Drosophila protein CG3973, the homologue of Gas2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ZK1151, the orthologue of Kakapo/Short stop.

The profile we developed covers the entire GAR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
