* PMP-22 / EMP / MP20 family signatures *
*****************************************

The following   vertebrate   small   integral   membrane   glycoproteins   are
evolutionary related [1,2,3]:

 - Peripheral  myelin  protein 22 (PMP-22), which is expressed in many tissues
   but mainly  by  Schwann  cells  as  a component of myelin of the peripheral
   nervous system  (PNS).  PMP-22  probably plays a role both in myelinization
   and in  cell  proliferation. Mutations affecting PMP-22 are associated with
   hereditary motor  and  sensory  neuropathies  such  as  Charcot-Marie-Tooth
   disease type 1A (CMT-1A) in human or the 'trembler' phenotype in mice.
 - Eye lens specific membrane protein 20 (MP20 or MP19).
 - Epithelial  membrane  protein-1  (EMP-1) (also  kwown  as  tumor-associated
   membrane protein (TMP) or as squamous cell-specific protein Cl-20).
 - Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP-2) (also kwown as XMP).
 - Epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP-3) (also kwown as YMP).

These are  proteins  of about 160 to 173 amino acid residues that contain four
transmembrane segments.  PMP-22,  EMP-1,  -2  and -3 are highly similar, while
MP20 is more distantly related.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as signature patterns, the first pattern
includes the end of the first transmembrane region and part of the loop before
the second  region.  The second pattern corresponds to the third transmembrane
region.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-[LIVMFC]-[LIVMF](2)-[SA]-[TL]-x(2)-[DNKS]-x-W-
                    x(9,13)-[LIV]-W-x(2)-[CG]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for human MP20.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [RQ]-[AVS]-x-[MC]-[IV]-L-[SA]-x-[LI]-x(4)-[GSA]-[LIVMF]-
                    [LIVMFS]-[LIVMF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  PMP-22  family  is evolutionary related to the claudin family (see
 <PDOC01045>).
