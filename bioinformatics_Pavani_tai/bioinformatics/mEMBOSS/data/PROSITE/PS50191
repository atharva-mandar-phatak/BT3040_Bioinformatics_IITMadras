* CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain profile *
******************************************

The CRAL-TRIO  domain  is  a structurally conserved element of about 170 amino
acids, which  constitute  a  hydrophobic  lipid  binding pocket. The CRAL-TRIO
domain is  found  in  GTPase-activating  proteins  (GAPs),  guanine nucleotide
exchange factors  (GEFs)  and a family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins,
including the  yeast  SEC14  protein  and  mammalian retinaldehyde- and alpha-
tocopherol-binding proteins. The CRAL-TRIO domain may either constitute all of
the protein or only part of it [1,2,3,4,5].

The resolution of the crystal structure of SEC14 has revealed the structure of
the CRAL-TRIO  lipid  binding  domain  (see  <PDB:1AUA>).  The CRAL-TRIO lipid
binding domain  is  an  alpha/beta  domain,  which  forms  a large hydrophobic
pocket. The  pocket  floor is constituted by six beta-strands and the sides of
the cavity are formed by alpha-helices [3].

Some proteins known to contain a CRAL-TRIO domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  phosphatidylinositol-transfer  protein  (SEC14).  It is required for
   transport of  secretory  proteins  from  the  golgi  complex in vivo and it
   catalyzes the  transfer  of  phosphatidylinositol  and  phosphatidylcholine
   between membranes in vitro.
 - Animal retinal-binding protein.
 - Animal  neurofibromin  (protein  NF-1).  In  human, defects in NF-1 are the
   cause of  type  1  neurofibromatosis  (NF-1),  one  of  the  most  frequent
   autosomal dominant diseases.
 - Mammalian BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa  protein-interacting protein 2 (NIP2).
   NIP2 is an apoptosis regulator.
 - Mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factor DBS (DBL's big sister).
 - Mammalian  cellular  retinol  retinaldehyde-binding  protein  (CRALBP).  It
   carries 11-cis-retinol  and  11-cis-retinaldehyde as endogenous ligands and
   may be a functional component of the visual cycle.
 - Mammalian  alpha-tocopherol  transfer  protein (alpha-TTP). It binds alpha-
   tocopherol and enhances its transfer between separate membranes.
 - Mammalian alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP).

The profile we developed covers the entire CRAL-TRIO domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
