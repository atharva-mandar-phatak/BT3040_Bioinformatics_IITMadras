* Hypothetical cof family signatures *
**************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Escherichia coli protein cof.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybhA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidA.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yigL and HI0597, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ycsE.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxeH.
 - Haemophilus influenzae HI0003.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG125.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG263.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG265.
 - Mycoplasma pneumoniae hypothetical protein A05_orf290.
 - Partial   hypothetical   proteins   from  Bacillus  stearothermophilus  and
   Mycoplasma capricolum.

There are  hydrophilic  proteins  of  about 250 to 280 amino acid residues. We
have developed two signature patterns for these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVFYAN]-[LIVMFA]-x(2)-D-[LIVMF]-[ND]-G-T-[LIV]-[LVY]-
                    [STANLM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for A05_orf290.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFC]-G-D-[GSANQ]-x-N-D-x(3)-[LIMFY]-x(2)-[AV]-x(2)-
                    [GSCP]-x(2)-[LMP]-x(2)-[GAS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for A05_orf290.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: A number of cation E-type ATPases.

-Last update: November 1997 / First entry.
