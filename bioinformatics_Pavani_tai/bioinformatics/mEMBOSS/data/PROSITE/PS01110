* RNA polymerases H / 23 Kd subunits signature *
************************************************

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing different sets of genes.  Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

Archaebacterial subunit H (gene rpoH) [1,2] is a small protein of about 8.5 to
10 Kd,  it is evolutionary related to the C-terminal part of a 23 Kd component
shared by  all  three  forms of eukaryotic RNA polymerases (gene RPB5 in yeast
and POLR2E in mammals).

As a signature pattern we selected a conserved  region which is located at the
N-terminal extremity  of  subunit  H; this region contains two histidines that
could play a role in the binding of a metal ion.

-Consensus pattern: H-[NQEIVMYD]-[LIVMYAS]-V-P-[EKT]-H-x(2)-[LIVM]-x(2)-
                    [DESAG]-[ET]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
