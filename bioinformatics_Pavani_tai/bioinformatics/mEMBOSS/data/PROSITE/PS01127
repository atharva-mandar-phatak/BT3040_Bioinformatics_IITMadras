* Elongation factor Ts signatures *
***********************************

In prokaryotes  elongation  factor Ts (EF-Ts) is a component of the elongation
cycle of  protein  biosynthesis.  It associates with the EF-Tu.GDP complex and
induces the  exchange  of  GDP to GTP, it remains bound to the aminoacyl-tRNA.
EF-Tu.GTP complex up to the GTP hydrolysis stage on the ribosome [1].

EF-Ts is also a  component  of  the chloroplast protein biosynthetic machinery
and is encoded in the genome of some algal chloroplast [2]. It is also present
in mitochondria [3].

As signature patterns for EF-Ts, we  selected two conserved regions located in
the N-terminal part of the protein.

-Consensus pattern: L-R-x(2)-[ST]-[GSDNQ]-x-[GSA]-[LIVMF]-x(0,1)-[DENKAC]-x-K-
                    [KRNEQS]-[AV]-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [ELAS]-[LIVMF]-[NVCKGST]-[SCVA]-[QE]-T-D-[FS]-[VLA]-[SAT]-
                    [KRNLAQS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
