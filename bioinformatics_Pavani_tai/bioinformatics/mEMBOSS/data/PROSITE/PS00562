* CBM1 (Carbohydrate-binding type-1) domain signature and profile *
*******************************************************************

The  microbial  degradation  of cellulose and xylans requires several types of
enzymes  such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases),  or  xylanases  (EC  3.2.1.8)  [1].  Cellulases and xylanases
generally  consist  of a catalytic domain and a cellulose-binding domain (CBD)
also called carbohydrate-binding module (CBM).

The  carbohydrate-binding  module  of a number of fungal cellulases (CBM1) has
been shown to consist of 38 amino acid residues. Enzymes known to contain such
a domain are:

 - Endoglucanase I (gene egl1) from Trichoderma reesei.
 - Endoglucanase II (gene egl2) from Trichoderma reesei.
 - Endoglucanase V (gene egl5) from Trichoderma reesei.
 - Exocellobiohydrolase I (gene CBHI) from Humicola grisea, Neurospora crassa,
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium,  Trichoderma reesei, and Trichoderma viride.
 - Exocellobiohydrolase II (gene CBHII) from Trichoderma reesei.
 - Exocellobiohydrolase 3 (gene cel3) from Agaricus bisporus
 - Endoglucanases B, C2, F and K from Fusarium oxysporum.

CBM1  is  found either at the N-terminal (Cbh-II or egl2) or at the C-terminal
extremity  (Cbh-I,  egl1  or  egl5)  of  these  enzymes. As it is shown in the
following schematic representation, there are four conserved cysteines in this
type of CBD domain, all involved in disulfide bonds. The CBM1 fold consists of
a  three-stranded  antiparallel  beta-sheet  (see  <PDB:1AZJ>) [2]. The domain
folds  into  a  wedge-shaped  structure  with  a  flat  face  containing three
conserved   aromatic   residues   separated  by  about  10.4  Angstroms  which
corresponds  to  the  periodicity of the glucose units in the cellulose. These
residues are thus probably involved in cellulose binding.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

Such a domain has also been found in a putative polysaccharide binding protein
from the  red  alga, Porphyra purpurea. Structurally, this protein consists of
four tandem repeats of the CBD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: CBM1  of  endoglucanase  I  and exocellobiohydrolase II  have  a  third
 disulfide bridge on their N-terminal side [3].
