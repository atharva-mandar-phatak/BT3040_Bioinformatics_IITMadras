* Amino acid permeases signature *
**********************************

Amino acid permeases are integral  membrane proteins involved in the transport
of amino acids into the cell.  A number of such proteins have been found to be
evolutionary related [1,2,3]. These proteins are:

 - Yeast general amino acid permeases (genes GAP1, AGP2 and AGP3).
 - Yeast basic amino acid permease (gene ALP1).
 - Yeast Leu/Val/Ile permease (gene BAP2).
 - Yeast arginine permease (gene CAN1).
 - Yeast dicarboxylic amino acid permease (gene DIP5).
 - Yeast asparagine/glutamine permease (gene AGP1).
 - Yeast glutamine permease (gene GNP1).
 - Yeast histidine permease (gene HIP1).
 - Yeast lysine permease (gene LYP1).
 - Yeast proline permease (gene PUT4).
 - Yeast valine and tyrosine permease (gene VAL1/TAT1).
 - Yeast tryptophan permease (gene TAT2/SCM2).
 - Yeast choline transport protein (gene HNM1/CTR1).
 - Yeast GABA permease (gene UGA4).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKL174c.
 - Fission yeast protein isp5.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC8A4.11
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC11D3.08c.
 - Emericella nidulans proline transport protein (gene prnB).
 - Trichoderma harzianum amino acid permease INDA1.
 - Salmonella typhimurium L-asparagine permease (gene ansP).
 - Escherichia coli aromatic amino acid transport protein (gene aroP).
 - Escherichia coli D-serine/D-alanine/glycine transporter (gene cycA).
 - Escherichia coli GABA permease (gene gabP).
 - Escherichia coli lysine-specific permease (gene lysP).
 - Escherichia coli phenylalanine-specific permease (gene pheP).
 - Salmonella typhimurium proline-specific permease (gene proY).
 - Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae hypothetical protein yeeF.
 - Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium hypothetical protein yifK.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  permeases  rocC  and  rocE  which  probably  transports
   arginine or ornithine.

These proteins seem to contain up to 12 transmembrane segments. As a signature
for this family of proteins we selected  the  best  conserved region  which is
located in the second transmembrane segment.

-Consensus pattern: [STAGC]-G-[PAG]-x(2,3)-[LIVMFYWA](2)-x-[LIVMFYW]-x-
                    [LIVMFWSTAGC](2)-[STAGC]-x(3)-[LIVMFYWT]-x-[LIVMST]-x(3)-
                    [LIVMCTA]-[GA]-E-x(5)-[PSAL]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for yeeF.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
