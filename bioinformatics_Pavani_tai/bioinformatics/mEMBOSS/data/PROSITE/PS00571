**********************
* Amidases signature *
**********************

It has been shown [1,2,3] that  several  enzymes  from various prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms which are involved in the hydrolysis of amides (amidases)
are evolutionary related. These enzymes are listed below.

 - Indoleacetamide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.-), a  bacterial plasmid-encoded enzyme
   that catalyzes the  hydrolysis  of  indole-3-acetamide (IAM) into indole-3-
   acetate (IAA), the  second  step  in  the   biosynthesis  of   auxins  from
   tryptophan.
 - Acetamidase  from  Emericella nidulans (gene amdS), an  enzyme which allows
   acetamide to be used as a sole carbon or nitrogen source.
 - Amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) from Rhodococcus sp. N-774 and Brevibacterium sp. R312
   (gene amdA). This enzyme hydrolyzes propionamides efficiently,  and also at
   a lower efficiency, acetamide, acrylamide and indoleacetamide.
 - Amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis.
 - 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer  hydrolase  (EC 3.5.2.12)   (nylon  oligomers
   degrading enzyme E1) (gene nylA), a bacterial plasmid  encoded enzyme which
   catalyzes the first  step in the degradation of 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic
   dimer, a by-product of nylon manufacture [4].
 - Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A [5].
 - Mammalian fatty acid amide hydrolase (gene FAAH) [6].
 - A putative amidase from yeast (gene AMD2).
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis putative amidases amiA2, amiB2, amiC and amiD.

All these enzymes contains in their central  section a highly conserved region
rich in glycine, serine, and alanine residues.  We  have used this region as a
signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-[GAV]-S-[GS](2)-G-x-[GSAE]-[GSAVYCT]-x-[LIVMT]-[GSA]-
                    x(6)-[GSAT]-x-[GA]-x-[DE]-x-[GA]-x-S-[LIVM]-R-x-P-[GSACTL]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
