* Phosphofructokinase signature *
*********************************

Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11)  (PFK) [1,2] is  a key  regulatory enzyme in
the glycolytic pathway.  It  catalyzes  the phosphorylation by ATP of fructose
6-phosphate  to fructose  1,6-bisphosphate.  In  bacteria PFK is a tetramer of
identical 36 Kd subunits. In mammals it is a tetramer of 80 Kd subunits.  Each
80 Kd subunit  consist of two  homologous domains  which are highly related to
the bacterial 36 Kd subunits. In Human there are three, tissue-specific, types
of PFK isozymes: PFKM (muscle),  PFKL (liver),  and PFKP (platelet).  In yeast
PFK is an octamer composed  of  four 100 Kd alpha chains (gene PFK1)  and four
100 Kd beta chains (gene PFK2);  like the  mammalian 80 Kd subunits, the yeast
100 Kd subunits are composed of two homologous domains.

As a signature pattern for PFK  we selected a region that contains three basic
residues involved in fructose-6-phosphate binding.

-Consensus pattern: [RK]-x(4)-[GAS]-H-x-[QL]-[QR]-[GS]-[GF]-x(5)-[DE]-[RL]
                    [The R/K, the H and the Q/R are involved in fructose-6-P
                     binding]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Escherichia coli has two phosphofructokinase isozymes which are encoded
 by genes pfkA (major) and pfkB (minor).  The pfkB isozyme is not evolutionary
 related to other prokaryotic or eukaryotic PFK's (see <PDOC00504>).

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
