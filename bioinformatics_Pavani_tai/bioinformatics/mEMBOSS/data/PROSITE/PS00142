* Neutral zinc metallopeptidases, zinc-binding region signature *
*****************************************************************

The majority of zinc-dependent  metallopeptidases (with the  notable exception
of the  carboxypeptidases) share a common pattern of primary structure [1,2,3]
in the  part  of  their  sequence  involved in the binding of zinc, and can be
grouped together  as  a  superfamily,known  as the metzincins, on the basis of
this sequence  similarity.  They  can  be classified into a number of distinct
families [4,E1]  which  are  listed  below  along with the proteases which are
currently known to belong to these families.

 Family M1
 - Bacterial aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) (gene pepN).
 - Mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2).

   that it binds zinc and is capable of peptidase activity.

 Family M2

   (ACE) the enzyme  responsible  for hydrolyzing angiotensin I to angiotensin
   II. There  are  two  forms of ACE:  a testis-specific isozyme and a somatic
   isozyme which has two active centers.

From the tertiary  structure  of  thermolysin, the  position  of  the residues
acting as zinc ligands and those involved in the catalytic activity are known.
Two of the zinc ligands are  histidines  which are  very close together in the
sequence;  C-terminal to  the first histidine is a glutamic acid residue which
acts as a  nucleophile and  promotes  the  attack of  a water  molecule on the
carbonyl carbon of the substrate.  A signature  pattern which includes the two
histidine and  the  glutamic  acid  residues  is  sufficient  to  detect  this
superfamily of proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [GSTALIVN]-{PCHR}-{KND}-H-E-[LIVMFYW]-{DEHRKP}-H-{EKPC}-
                    [LIVMFYWGSPQ]
                    [The 2 H's are zinc ligands]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for members of families M5, M7 amd M11.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 77;  including   Neurospora  crassa
 conidiation-specific protein 13 which could be a zinc-protease.
