* Extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases signature *
**************************************************

Dioxygenases catalyze the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into
substrates.  Cleavage of  aromatic rings is one of the most important function
of  dioxygenases.   The  substrates  of  ring-cleavage   dioxygenases  can  be
classified into two groups  according to the mode  of scission of the aromatic
ring. Intradiol enzymes  cleave the aromatic ring between two hydroxyl groups,
whereas  extradiol  enzymes cleave  the aromatic  ring between  a hydroxylated
carbon and another adjacent nonhydroxylated carbon. Extradiol dioxygenases are
usually homomultimeric,  bind  one  atom of ferrous ion per subunit and have a
subunit size  of about 33 Kd. It has been shown [1,2] that the known extradiol
dioxygenases are  evolutionary related. The enzymes that belong to this family
are:

 - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase  (EC 1.13.11.2)  (metapyrocatechase)  (genes nahH,
   xylE, dmpB, mcpII, and pheB).
 - 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene todE).
 - Biphenyl-2,3-diol  1,2-dioxygenase  (EC  1.13.11.39) (DHBD) (gene bphC). It
   should be noted that in Rhodococcus globerulus, three different isozymes of
   DHBD have been found (genes bphC1 to bphC3). bphC1 is a classical extradiol
   dioxygenase, but bphC2 and bphC3 are smaller proteins (189 residues).
 - 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene nahC).
 - 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene dbfB).

As a signature pattern for  these enzymes  we  selected a region that includes
four conserved  residues.  Among them is a glutamate which has been shown [3],
in bphC, to be implicated in the binding of the ferrous iron atom.
