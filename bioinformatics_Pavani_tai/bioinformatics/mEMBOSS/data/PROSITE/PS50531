* IS21/IS408 transposase-types HTH domains profiles *
*****************************************************

Autonomous  mobile genetic elements such as transposons or insertion sequences
(IS) encode an enzyme, called transposase, required for excising and inserting
the mobile element. The IS21 is among the largest of bacterial IS elements and
encodes  a  transposase  designated as istA (ORF1) as well as a second protein
istB   (ORF2)   and   represents  the  IS21/IS408/IS1162  family  [E1,1].  The
transposases  of  IS21-like  IS  contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the
N-terminal part that probably binds to DNA. An integrase catalytic domain (see
<PDOC50994>)   forms  the  central  part  of  these  IS21/IS408/IS1162  family
transposases.

On  the  basis of sequence similarities, two types of HTH-domains can be found
in IS21-like transposases.

The  first,  IS21 transposase-type HTH domain, occurs in transposases from the
following elements:

 - IS21 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - IS1326 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - IS640 from Shigella sonnei.
 - IS5376 from Bacillus stearothermophilus.
 - IS232 from Bacillus thuringiensis.
 - IS21-like from Bacteroides fragilis.
 - A potential insertion element from Chelatobacter heintzii.

The  second is a IS408/IS1162 transposase-type HTH domain. Some proteins known
to contain this domain:

 - A putative transposase y4uI from Rhizobium sp. (strain NGR234).
 - A putative transposase y4bL/y4kJ/y4tB from Rhizobium sp. (strain NGR234).
 - Transposase from IS408 from Burkholderia cepacia.
 - Transposase from IS1162 from Pseudomonas fluorescens.

The   profiles  we  developed  cover  the  entire  IS21  transposase-type  and
IS408/IS1162 transposase-type HTH domains.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
