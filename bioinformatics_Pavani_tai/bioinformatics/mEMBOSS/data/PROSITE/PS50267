* Sodium:neurotransmitter symporter family signatures and profile *
*******************************************************************

After their release by synapses the action  of  a  number of neurotransmitters
is  terminated  by  their   high  affinity   sodium-dependent   reuptake  into
presynaptic terminals  by specific transport proteins [1 to 4]. These proteins
are the  target of psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine. All
these proteins  belong  to  a family, known [5] as the sodium:neurotransmitter
symporter family  (SNF),  that  also  include  some transporters that function
outside the  brain  and  carry  related molecules. The SNF family is currently
known to consist of transporters for:

 - Betaine (also transports GABA).
 - Choline.
 - Creatine.
 - Dopamine.
 - GABA (four different forms of GABA transporters have been characterized).
 - Glycine (two forms).
 - Noradrenaline.
 - Proline.
 - Serotonin (5HT).
 - Taurine.

 - Mammalian orphan transporter NTT4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical transporter T23G5.5.

 - Haemophilus hypothetical proteins HI0736 and HI1690.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical MJ1319.

These transporters  are glycoproteins of about 600 to 700 amino-acid residues.
The two  bacterial proteins are smaller (457 to 508 residues).  These proteins
seem to  contain 12 transmembrane domains and both termini are predicted to be
located in the cytoplasm.

As signature patterns for these proteins we have selected two highly conserved
regions. The first region spans the C-terminal part of the first transmembrane
domain, a short extracellular  loop,   and  the N-terminal part of  the second
transmembrane  domain.   The  second  region   is   located  in   the  largest
extracellular loop between the third  and fourth  transmembrane domains;  this
region  contains two conserved cysteines  that  could be involved in disulfide
bonds. We also developed a profile for this family of proteins.

-Consensus pattern: W-[RK]-F-[GPA]-[YF]-x(4)-[NYHS]-G-G-[GCA]-x-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [YF]-[LIVMFY]-x(2)-[SC]-[LIVMFY]-[STQV]-x(2)-[LVI]-P-W-
                    x(2)-C-x(3,4)-[NWDS]-[GSTERHAK]
                    [The C may be involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the  bacterial  and  archaebacterial proteins which are divergent in this
 region.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
