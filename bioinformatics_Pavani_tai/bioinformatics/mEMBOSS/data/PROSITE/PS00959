* Histone H3 signatures *
*************************

Histone H3  is  one  of  the  four histones, along with H2A, H2B and H4, which
forms the  eukaryotic nucleosome core. It is a highly conserved protein of 135
amino acid residues [1,2,E1].

The following proteins have been found to contain a C-terminal H3-like domain:

 - Mammalian  centromeric  protein  CENP-A  [3].  Could  act as a core histone
   necessary for the assembly of centromeres.
 - Yeast chromatin-associated protein CSE4 [4].
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  chromosome III encodes two highly related proteins
   (F54C8.2 and  F58A4.3)  whose C-terminal section is evolutionary related to
   the last  100  residues  of  H3.  The function of these proteins is not yet
   known.

We developed  two signature patterns, The first one corresponds to a perfectly
conserved heptapeptide in the N-terminal part of H3. The second one is derived
from a conserved region in the central section of H3.

-Consensus pattern: K-A-P-R-K-[QH]-[LI]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the H3-like proteins and some protozoan H3.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: P-F-x-[RA]-L-[VA]-[KRQ]-[DEG]-[IV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
