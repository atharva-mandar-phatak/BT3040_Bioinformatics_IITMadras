* Bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase family active site signatures *
*******************************************************************

Many forms of RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) are known.  Most RNA polymerases are
multimeric enzymes, but there is a family of  single  chain polymerases, which
are evolutionary  related,  and  which  originate  from bacteriophages or from
mitochondria. The RNA polymerases that belong to this family are [1]:

 - Podoviridae bacteriophages T3, T7, and K11 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage SP6 polymerase.
 - Vertebrate mitochondrial polymerase (gene POLRMT).
 - Fungal mitochondrial polymerase (gene RPO41).
 - Polymerases encoded  on mitochondrial linear  DNA plasmids in various fungi
   and plants: Agaricus bitorquis pEM,   Claviceps purpurea pClK1,  Neurospora
   crassa Kalilo; Neurospora intermedia Maranhar and maize S-2).

Two conserved aspartate and  one  lysine residue  have  been shown [2,3] to be
part of the active site of T7 polymerase.  We have used the regions around the
first aspartate and around the lysine as signature patterns for this family of
polymerases.

-Consensus pattern: P-[LIVM]-x(2)-D-[GA]-[ST]-[AC]-[SN]-[GA]-[LIVMFY]-Q
                    [D is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-x-R-x(3)-K-x(2)-[LIVMF]-M-[PT]-x(2)-Y
                    [K is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
