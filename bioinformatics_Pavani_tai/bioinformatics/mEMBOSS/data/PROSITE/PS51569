* DOT1 domain profile *
***********************

The   Dot1  protein  (Dot1p)  is  an  histone-lysine  N-methyltransferase  (EC
2.1.1.43)  [E1] that methylates lysine 79 (Lys-79) of histone H3. It was first
identified  as  a  Disruptor  Of  Telomeric  silencing in yeast where Dot1p is
implicated  in  gene  silencing  and  localization  of  the Silent Information
Regulator  (SIR)  complex; in higher eukaryotes the methylation carried out by
this  enzyme  may  be used for differentiating chromatin domains. Unlike other
histone-lysine  methyltransferases  (HKMTs),  Dot1p  displays  a Rossmann-like
(Class  I)  S-adenosyl-L-methyionine (SAM)-dependent MT fold (see <PDOC51555>)
while other HKMTs contain the SET domain (see <PDOC50280>) and hence belong to
a whole different structural class (see <PDOC51565>) [1,2].

Whereas  most HKMTs, such as Suvar3-9 methylate Lys on the N-terminal tails of
histones  that  stick  out  from  the  nucleosome,  Dot1p substrate (Lys-79 of
histone  H3)  is  located  in  the  conserved  histone  core,  in a short turn
connecting  the  first  and  second  helices,  exposed  on the nucleosome disk
surface  [1,2].  In  order for Lys-79 of H3 to be methylated by Dot1p, another
lysine,  Lys-123  of histone H2B, needs to be ubiquitinated. A possible reason
put forward for this requirement is that the ubiquitination may create a space
between  adjacent  nucleosomes,  permitting  access  of Dot1p to its substrate
[1,2].  In  yeast,  different  states  of  methylation on Lys-79 of histone H3
(unmodified,  mono-,  di- and trimethylated) co-exist at the same time, but no
clear function is associated with these different methylation states [1].

The strucure of the evolutionary conserved core of Dot1p, the DOT1 domain, has
first    been    described    for    the   yeast   Dot1p   in   complex   with
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine  (AdoHcy)  (see  <PDB:1U2Z>)  and then for the human
Dot1-like  protein  (Dot1Lp)  in  complex  with SAM (see <PDB:1NW3>). The DOT1
domain  is  about 300-350 amino acids long and is usually located at either of
the  extremities  of  the protein sequence: it stands at the C-terminus of the
yeast  Dot1p  and at the N-terminus of the human Dot1Lp [1,2]. DOT1 displays a
rather  elongated  structure  and can be subdivided into two parts: the N- and
the  C-terminal  subdomains  [2]. The N-terminal part is made up of five alpha
helices  and  two  pairs  of  short  beta strand hairpins. The C-terminal part
displays   a   Rossmann-like   fold   (see  <PDOC51555>):  it  consists  in  a
seven-stranded  beta  sheet tucked by five alpha helices (three helices on one
side  of  the  sheet  and  two  on  the  other),  the sheet contains a central
topological switchpoint resulting in a deep pocket where SAM is bound. The two
subdomains  are linked covalently by a loop. Altogether the SAM binding pocket
is formed by five segments of the DOT1 domain of which four are located in the
C-terminal substructure of the DOT1 domain and one in the loop connecting both
parts;   two  of  these  segments  are  conserved  across  different  Class  I
SAM-dependent MTs (see <PDOC51555>) [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire DOT1 domain.
