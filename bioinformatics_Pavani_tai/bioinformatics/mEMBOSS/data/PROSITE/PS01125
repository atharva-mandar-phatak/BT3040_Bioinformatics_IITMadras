* ROK family signature *
************************

A family   of   bacterial   proteins  has  been  described  [1]  which  groups
transcriptional repressors, sugar kinases and yet uncharacterized open reading
frames. This  family,  known as ROK (Repressor, ORF, Kinase) currently consist
of:

 - Xylose  operon  repressor  (gene  xylR) in Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus
   pentosus and Staphylococcus xylosus.
 - N-acetylglucosamine repressor (gene nagC) from Escherichia coli.
 - Glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2) (gene glk) from Streptomyces coelicolor.
 - Fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) (gene scrK or frk)  from Pediococcus pentosaceus,
   Streptococcus mutans and Zymomonas mobilis.
 - Escherichia coli allokinase (EC 2.7.1.55) (gene alsK).
 - Escherichia protein mlc.
 - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yajF  and HI0182,  the  corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yhcI  and HI0144,  the  corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - A hypothetical protein in nagH 5'region from Clostridium perfringens.

The repressor proteins (xylR and nagC) from  this  family possess a N-terminal
region not present in the sugar kinases and which contains an helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding motif. The domain common to all  these  proteins consists of about
300 residues.  It  is  not  highly  conserved,  but  we could define a pattern
centered on a glycine-rich region in the central part of the domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x(2)-G-[LIVMFCT]-G-x-[GA]-[LIVMFA]-x(3)-{V}-x(4)-G-
                    x(3,5)-[GATP]-{G}-x-G-[RKH]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for mlc.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
