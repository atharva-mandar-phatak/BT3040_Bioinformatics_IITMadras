The  phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) [1,2]
is  a  major  carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyzes the
phosphorylation   of   incoming   sugar   substrates  concomitant  with  their
translocation  across  the  cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS is
the   following:   a   phosphoryl  group  from  phosphoenolpyruvate  (PEP)  is
transferred to enzyme I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl
carrier  protein  (HPr)  (see  <PDOC00318>).  Phospho-HPr  then  transfers the
phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three
structurally  distinct  domains  (IIA,  IIB, and IIC), [3] which can either be
fused  together  in  a  single  polypeptide  chain  or  exist  as two or three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The  first domain (IIA) (see <PDOC00528>), carries the first permease-specific
phosphorylation site, an histidine which is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The
second  domain  (IIB)  is  phosphorylated  by  phospho-IIA  on  a cysteinyl or
histidyl  residue, depending on the sugar transported. Finally, the phosphoryl
group  is transferred from the IIB domain to the sugar substrate concomitantly
with  the  sugar uptake processed by the IIC domain (see <PDOC51103>). The IIC
domain  forms  the  translocation  channel  and the specific substrate-binding
site.  An additional transmembrane domain IID (see <PDOC51108>), homologous to
IIC, can be found in some PTSs, e.g. for mannose [1,3,4,5,6].

According   to   structural  and   sequence  analyses,  the   PTS  EIIB domain
(EC 2.7.1.69) can be divided in five groups [7,8,9,10].

 - The PTS EIIB type 1 domain, which is found in the Glucose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  80 amino acids. It forms a split alpha/beta
   sandwich  composed  of  an  antiparallel sheet (beta 1 to beta 4) and three
   alpha helices superimposed onto one side of the sheet (see <PDB:1IBA>). The
   phosphorylation  site  (Cys) is located at the end of the first beta strand
   on  a  protrusion formed by the edge of beta 1 and the reverse turn between
   beta 1 and beta 2 [7].

 - The  PTS  EIIB type 2 domain, which is found  in the Mannitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length  of  about  100 amino acids. It consists of a four
   stranded  parallel  beta sheet flanked by two alpha helices (alpha 1 and 3)
   on  one  face and helix alpha 2 on the opposite face, with a characteristic
   Rossmann  fold  comprising  two  right-handed  beta-alpha-beta  motifs (see
   <PDB:1VKR>). The phosphorylation site (Cys) is located at the N-terminus of
   the domain, in the first beta strand [8].

 - The PTS EIIB type 3 domain, which is found in the Lactose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about 100 amino acids. It is composed of a central
   four-stranded  parallel  open twisted beta sheet, which is flanked by three
   alpha  helices  on  the concave side and two on the convex side of the beta
   sheet  (see  <PDB:1IIB>).  The phosphorylation site (Cys) is located in the
   C-terminal end of the first beta strand [9].

 - The PTS EIIB type 4 domain, which is found in the Mannose class of PTS, has
   an  average length of about 160 amino acids. It has a central core of seven
   parallel  beta  strands  surrounded  by a total of six alpha-helices. Three
   helices  cover  the  front  face,  one the back face with the remaining two
   capping  the central beta sheet at the top and bottom (see <PDB:1NRZ>). The
   phosphorylation  site  (His)  is located at the suface exposed loop between
   strand 1 and helix 1 [10].

 - The  PTS  EIIB type 5 domain, which is found  in the Sorbitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length of about 190 amino acids. The phosphorylation site
   (Cys) is located in the N-terminus of the domain.

The  region  around the phosphorylated cysteine of some PTS components is well
conserved  and  can  be used [11] as a signature pattern for the following IIB
domains:

 - Arbutin-, cellobiose- and salicin-specific; IIB(Asc).
 - Beta-glucosides-specific; IIB(Bgl).
 - Glucose-specific; IIB(Glc).
 - N-acetylglucosamine-specific; IIB(Nag).
 - Sucrose-specific; IIB(Scr).
 - Maltose and glucose-specific (gene malX).
 - Trehalose-specific (gene treB).
 - Escherichia coli arbutin-like (gene glvB).
 - Bacillus subtilis sacX.

A EIIB-like type 2 domain can be found in bacterial transcriptional regulatory
proteins  [5].  In  these  cases, the EIIB-like domain is found in association
with  other domains like the DeoR-type HTH domain (see <PDOC00696>) or the PTS
regulatory  domain  (a  transcriptional  antiterminator).  It  may  possess  a
regulatory  function, through its phosphorylation activity, or act as a simple
phosphoryl donor.

We  have  developed  a  signature pattern for the phosphorylation site of EIIB
domains.  We  also  developed  five  profiles  that  cover the entire PTS EIIB
domains.  These  profiles  are  directed respectively against Glucose class of
PTS,  Mannitol  class  of PTS, Lactose class of PTS, Mannose class of PTS, and
Sorbitol class of PTS.
