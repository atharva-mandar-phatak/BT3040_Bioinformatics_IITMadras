* Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase 49 Kd subunit signature *
****************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located in  the  inner mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there is one with a molecular weight of 49 Kd (in mammals), which is the third
largest subunit of  complex I  and  is a  component  of  the  iron-sulfur (IP)
fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind a 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster.  The 49
Kd subunit has been found to be:

 - Nuclear encoded, as a precursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and
   in Neurospora crassa.
 - Mitochondrial encoded in protozoan such as Paramecium (ORF 400), Leishmania
   and Trypanosoma (MURF 3).
 - Chloroplast encoded in various higher plants (ORF 392).

The 49 Kd subunit is highly similar to [3,4]:

 - Subunit D of Escherichia coli NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoD).
 - Subunit NQO4 of Paracoccus denitrificans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
 - Subunit 5 of Escherichia coli formate hydrogenlyase (gene hycE).
 - Subunit G of Escherichia coli hydrogenase-4 (gene hyfG).

As as signature pattern we selected a highly  conserved region, located in the
N-terminal section of this subunit.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMH]-H-[RT]-[GA]-x-E-K-[LIVMTN]-x-E-x-[KRQ]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
