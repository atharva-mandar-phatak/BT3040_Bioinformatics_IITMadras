* Annexins repeated domain signature *
**************************************

Annexins [1  to 6]  are a   group  of calcium-binding  proteins that associate
reversibly  with membranes.   They  bind   to  phospholipid   bilayers  in the
presence  of micromolar free calcium  concentration.   The binding is specific
for calcium and for acidic phospholipids.  Annexins  have  been  claimed to be
involved in cytoskeletal interactions, phospholipase inhibition, intracellular
signalling, anticoagulation, and membrane fusion.

Each of these  proteins  consist  of  an  N-terminal domain of variable length
followed by four or eight copies of a conserved segment of sixty one residues.
The repeat (sometimes known  as  an 'endonexin fold')  consists of five alpha-
helices that are wound into a right-handed superhelix [7].

The proteins known to belong to the annexin family are listed below:

 - Annexin I (Lipocortin 1) (Calpactin 2) (p35) (Chromobindin 9).
 - Annexin II (Lipocortin 2) (Calpactin 1) (Protein I) (p36) (Chromobindin 8).
 - Annexin III (Lipocortin 3) (PAP-III).
 - Annexin IV (Lipocortin 4) (Endonexin I) (Protein II) (Chromobindin 4).
 - Annexin V (Lipocortin 5) (Endonexin 2) (VAC-alpha) (Anchorin CII) (PAP-I).
 - Annexin VI (Lipocortin 6) (Protein III) (Chromobindin 20) (p68) (p70). This
   is the only known annexin that contains 8 (instead of 4) repeats.
 - Annexin VII (Synexin).
 - Annexin VIII (Vascular anticoagulant-beta) (VAC-beta).
 - Annexin IX from Drosophila.
 - Annexin X from Drosophila.
 - Annexin XI (Calcyclin-associated annexin) (CAP-50).
 - Annexin XII from Hydra vulgaris.
 - Annexin XIII (Intestine-specific annexin) (ISA).

The signature  pattern for this  domain spans  positions 9 to 61 of the repeat
and includes the only perfectly conserved residue (an arginine in position 22).

-Consensus pattern: [TG]-[STV]-x(8)-[LIVMF]-x(2)-R-x(3)-[DEQNH]-x(2)-{S}-x(4)-
                    [IFY]-x(7)-[LIVMF]-x(3)-[LIVMF]-x(5)-{I}-x(5)-[LIVMFA]-
                    x(2)-[LIVMF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL. But the
 pattern will miss some of the repeats of annexin IX, X, XI, and XII.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.

-Note: A  sequence  similar  to  the  annexin  domain  has  been  found in the
 N-terminal of alpha-giardins of Giardia lamblia [8].
