* PH domain profile *
*********************

The 'pleckstrin  homology'  (PH) domain is a domain of about 100 residues that
occurs in  a  wide range of proteins involved in intracellular signaling or as
constituents of the cytoskeleton [1 to 7].

The function of this domain is not clear, several putative functions have been
suggested:

 - binding to the beta/gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins,
 - binding to lipids, e.g. phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate,
 - binding to phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues,
 - attachment to membranes by an unknown mechanism.

It is  possible  that  different  PH  domains  have  totally  different ligand
requirements.

The 3D  structure  of  several  PH  domains has been determined [8]. All known
cases have  a  common  structure consisting of two perpendicular anti-parallel
beta sheets,  followed by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. The loops connecting
the beta-strands  differ  greatly  in  length, making the PH domain relatively
difficult to  detect.  There  are  no totally invariant residues within the PH
domain.

Proteins reported  to  contain  one  more  PH  domains belong to the following
families:

 - Pleckstrin, the protein where this domain was first detected, is  the major
   substrate of protein kinase C in platelets. Pleckstrin  is  one of the rare
   proteins to contains two PH domains.
 - Ser/Thr protein  kinases such as the Act/Rac  family,  the  beta-adrenergic
   receptor kinases, the mu isoform of PKC and the trypanosomal NrkA family.
 - Tyrosine protein kinases belonging to the Btk/Itk/Tec subfamily.
 - Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1).
 - Regulators  of  small  G-proteins  like guanine nucleotide releasing factor
   GNRP (Ras-GRF) (which contains 2 PH domains), guanine  nucleotide  exchange
   proteins like  vav,  dbl,  SoS  and yeast CDC24, GTPase activating proteins
   like rasGAP and BEM2/IPL2, and the human break point cluster protein bcr.
 - Cytoskeletal  proteins  such  as  dynamin (see <PDOC00362>), Caenorhabditis
   elegans kinesin-like  protein  unc-104  (see  <PDOC00343>),  spectrin beta-
   chain, syntrophin (2 PH domains) and yeast nuclear migration protein NUM1.
 - Mammalian  phosphatidylinositol-specific  phospholipase  C  (PI-PLC)   (see
   <PDOC50007>) isoforms  gamma  and  delta.  Isoform  gamma  contains  two PH
   domains, the  second  one  is  split  into two parts separated by about 400
   residues.
 - Oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs).
 - Mouse  protein  citron,  a putative rho/rac effector that binds to the GTP-
   bound forms of rho and rac,
 - Several yeast proteins involved in cell cycle  regulation and bud formation
   like BEM2,  BEM3,  BUD4  and the BEM1-binding proteins BOI2 (BEB1) and BOI1
   (BOB1).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein mig-10.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C04D8.1, K06H7.4 and ZK632.12.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YBR129c and YHR155w.

The profile for the PH domain, which has been developed by  Toby Gibson at the
EMBL, covers  the  total  length  of  domain.  Several  proteins contain large
insertions in  the  PH  domain  and  are  thus  difficult  to detect with this
profile. In  some of these cases,  the  profile will align only to one half of
the PH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.  But it
 should be  noted that while all sequences containing PH domains are detected,
 not all  PH  domains  are.  Some  of  the  split domains lie below the cutoff
 threshold.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
