* Prokaryotic transcription elongation factors signatures *
***********************************************************

Bacterial proteins   greA and  greB [1,2]  are  necessary  for  efficient  RNA
polymerase transcription elongation  past  template-encoded  arresting  sites.
Arresting sites  in  DNA  have  the property of trapping a certain fraction of
elongating RNA polymerases  that  pass  through, resulting in  locked DNA/RNA/
polymerase ternary  complexes.  Cleavage of the nascent transcript by cleavage
factors, such  as  greA or greB, allows  the resumption of elongation from the
new 3'terminus.  GreA  induces cleavage 2 or 3 nucleotides behind the terminus
while greB releases longer sequences up to 9 nucleotides in length.

GreA and greB are related proteins  of about 160 amino-acid residues.  We have
developed two   signature   patterns   for  this  protein  family.  The  first
corresponds to  a  conserved region in the N-terminal section, the second to a
region in the C-terminal section.
