* moaA / nifB / pqqE family signature *
***************************************

A number  of  proteins  involved in the biosynthesis of metallo cofactors have
been shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These proteins are:

 - Bacterial  and  archebacterial  protein  moaA,  which  is  involved  in the
   biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (molybdopterin; MPT).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana cnx2, a protein involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis
   and which is highlys similar to moaA.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  narA,  which  seems  to  be  the  moaA ortholog in that
   bacteria.
 - Bacterial  protein  nifB (or fixZ) which is involved in the biosynthesis of
   the nitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor.
 - Bacterial  protein  pqqE  which  is  involved  in  the  biosynthesis of the
   cofactor pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ).
 - Pyrococcus  furiosus  cmo,  a  protein  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  a
   molybdopterin-based tungsten cofactor.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F49E2.1.

All these proteins share, in their N-terminal region, a conserved  domain that
contains three  cysteines.  In moaA, these cysteines have been shown [1] to be
important for the biological activity. They could be inolved in the binding of
an iron-sulfur cluster.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-x(3)-C-[NDP]-[LIVMF]-[DNQRS]-C-x-[FYM]-C
                    [The 3 C's may be Fe-S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
