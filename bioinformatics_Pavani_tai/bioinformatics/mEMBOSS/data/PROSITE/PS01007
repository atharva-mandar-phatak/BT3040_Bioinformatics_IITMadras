* Transposases, Mutator family, signature *
*******************************************

Autonomous mobile genetic elements  such as  transposon or insertion sequences
(IS) encode an enzyme, called transposase, required for excising and inserting
the mobile element. On the basis of sequence similarities, transposases can be
grouped into various families. One of these families has been shown [1,2,3,E1]
to consist of transposases from the following elements:

 - Mutator from Maize.
 - Is1201 from Lactobacillus helveticus.
 - Is905 from Lactococcus lactis.
 - Is1081 from Mycobacterium bovis.
 - Is6120 from Mycobacterium smegmatis.
 - Is406 from Pseudomonas cepacia.
 - IsRm3 from Rhizobium meliloti.
 - IsRm5 from Rhizobium meliloti.
 - Is256 from Staphylococcus aureus.
 - IsT2 from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.

The maize  Mutator  transposase  (MudrA)  is  a  protein  of  823 amino acids;
the bacterial  transposases  listed  above  are  proteins  of 300 to 420 amino
acids. These  proteins  contain  a  conserved  domain of about 130 residues; a
signature pattern was derived from the most conserved part of this domain.

-Consensus pattern: D-x(3)-G-[LIVMF]-x(6)-[STAV]-[LIVMFYW]-[PT]-x-[STAV]-x(2)-
                    [QR]-x-C-x(2)-H
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
