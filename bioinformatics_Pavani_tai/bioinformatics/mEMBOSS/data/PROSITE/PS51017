* CCT domain profile *
**********************

The CCT  (CONSTANS,  CO-like,  and  TOC1)  domain  is a highly conserved basic
module of  ~43  amino  acids,  which  is  found  near  the C-terminus of plant
proteins often  involved in light signal transduction. The CCT domain is found
in association  with  other  domains,  such  as  the  B-box  zinc  finger (see
<PDOC50119>), the  GATA-type  zinc  finger (see <PDOC00300>), the ZIM motif or
the response  regulatory  domain  (see  <PDOC50110>).  The CCT domain has been
shown to  be  involved in nuclear localization and probably also has a role in
protein-protein interaction [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a CCT domain are listed below:

 - Plant CONSTANS family of transcription factors.
 - Plant GATA factor subfamily III [3].
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana timing of CAB expression 1 (TOC1) or ABI3-interacting
   protein 1 (AIP1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana TOC1-Like (TL).

The profile we developed covers the entire CCT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
