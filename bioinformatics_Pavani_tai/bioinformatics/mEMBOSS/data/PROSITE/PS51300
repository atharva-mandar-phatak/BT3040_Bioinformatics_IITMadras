* NADH-nitrite reductase subunit D family profile *
***************************************************

In  Proteobacteria  and  Actinobacteria the main nitrite reductase activity is
contributed  by  the  NADH-dependent  nitrite  reductase, which detoxifies the
nitrite formed as the product of nitrate reduction. The NADH-nitrite reductase
operon consists of 4 genes: nirB, nirD, nirC and cysG. The enzyme is formed by
the  two  subunits  nirB  and  nirD. NirC is a nitrite transporter and cysG is
required for the synthesis of siroheme, a cofactor of the nirB subunit [1,2].

NirD  displays  some  sequence similarities with the 2Fe-2S Rieske domain (see
<PDOC00177>),  but  it  does  not  contain  the  essential  residues  for  the
coordination of the iron sulfur [3].

The profile we developed covers the whole conserved region.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2007 / First entry.

-Note:  The  nirD  profile  is  in  competition  with a profile of a related
 domain, i.e.  Rieske domain (see <PDOC51300>).
