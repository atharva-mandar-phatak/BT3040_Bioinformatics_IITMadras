*******************************************************************

Small, acid-soluble spore proteins  (SASP or ASSP) [1,2] are proteins found in
the spores of  bacteria  of  the  genera  Bacillus,  Thermoactynomycetes,  and
Clostridium. SASP are bound to spore DNA. They are double-stranded DNA-binding
proteins  that cause DNA to change to an A-like conformation. They protect the
DNA backbone from chemical  and  enzymatic  cleavage  and are thus involved in
dormant spore's high resistance to UV light.  SASP  are  degraded in the first
minutes of spore  germination  and  provide  amino  acids for both new protein
synthesis and metabolism.

There are two distinct families  of SASP: the  alpha/beta type and the  gamma-
type. Alpha/beta SASP are small proteins of about sixty to  seventy amino acid
residues.  They  are generally  coded by a multigene family.  Two  regions  of
alpha/beta SASP are particularly well conserved: the  first  region is located
in the N-terminal  half  and  contains  the  site  which is cleaved by a SASP-
specific protease that acts during  germination;  the second region is located
in the C-terminal section and is probably involved in DNA-binding. We selected
both regions as signature patterns for these proteins.
