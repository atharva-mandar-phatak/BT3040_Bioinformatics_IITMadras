* Heme oxygenase signature *
****************************

Heme oxygenase  (EC 1.14.99.3) (HO) [1]  is  the  microsomal  enzyme  that, in
animals, carries out the oxidation of heme, it cleaves the  heme  ring  at the
alpha methene bridge  to  form biliverdin and  carbon monoxide.  Biliverdin is
subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.

In mammals there are three isozymes of heme oxygenase: HO-1 to HO-3. The first
two isozymes differ in their tissue expression and their inducibility: HO-1 is
highly inducible by its substrate  heme  and  by  various non-heme substances,
while HO-2  is  non-inducible.  It  has  been suggested [2] that HO-2 could be
implicated in  the production of carbon monoxide in the brain where it is said
to act as a neurotransmitter.

In the  genome  of  the  chloroplast of red algae as well as in cyanobacteria,
there is  a heme oxygenase (gene pbsA) that is the key enzyme in the synthesis
of the chromophoric part of the photosynthetic antennae [3]. An heme oxygenase
is also present in the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae (gene hmuO), where
it is involved in the acquisition of iron from the host heme [4].

There is,  in  the  central  section of these enzymes, a well conserved region
centered on  a  histidine  residue.  We  have  used this region as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: L-[IV]-A-H-[STACH]-Y-[STV]-[RT]-Y-[LIVM]-G
