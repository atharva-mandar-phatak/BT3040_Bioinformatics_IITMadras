* CTF/NF-I DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
*****************************************************

Nuclear factor I (NF-I) or CCAAT box-binding transcription factor  (CTF) [1,2]
(also known   as  TGGCA-binding  proteins)  are a family of vertebrate nuclear
proteins  which  recognize  and bind,  as dimers, the palindromic DNA sequence
5'-TTGGCNNNNNGCCAA-3'. CTF/NF-I    binding  sites  are  present  in  viral and
cellular promoters and in the origin of DNA replication of Adenovirus type 2.

The CTF/NF-I  proteins were first identified as nuclear factor I, a collection
of proteins  that  activate  the  replication  of several Adenovirus serotypes
(together with  NF-II  and  NF-III)  [3].  The  family  of  proteins  was also
identified as  the  CTF transcription factors, before the NFI and CTF families
were found to be identical [4]. The CTF/NF-I proteins are individually capable
of activating  transcription and DNA replication. The CTF/NF-I family name has
also been dubbed as NFI, NF-I or NF1.

In a given species, there  are a  large number of different CTF/NF-I proteins.
The multiplicity  of  CTF/NF-I  is  known  to be generated both by alternative
splicing and  by  the  occurrence  of four different genes. The known forms of
NF-I genes have been classified as:

 - The CTF-like factors subfamily (prototype form: CTF-1) [4]
 - The NFI-X proteins.
 - The NFI-A proteins.
 - The NFI-B proteins.

So far,  all  CTF/NF-I family members appear to have similar transcription and
replication activities.

CTF/NF-I proteins contains 400 to 600 amino acids.  The N-terminal  200 amino-
acid sequence,  almost perfectly conserved in all species and genes sequenced,
mediates site-specific  DNA  recognition,  protein dimerization and Adenovirus
DNA replication.  The  C-terminal  100 amino acids contain the transcriptional
activation domain.  This  activation  domain  is the target of gene expression
regulatory pathways  ellicited  by  growth factors and it interacts with basal
transcription factors and with histone H3 [6].

The CTF/NF-I  DNA-binding  domain  contains four conserved Cys residues, which
are required for its DNA-binding activity [7].

As a specific signature  for this  family of proteins, we selected a perfectly
conserved, highly charged 12 residue peptide located in the DNA-binding domain
of CTF/NF-I.  We also developed a profile that covers the entire CTF/NF-I DNA-
binding domain.

-Consensus pattern: R-K-R-K-Y-F-K-K-H-E-K-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: It  has been said that the CTF/NF-I DNA-binding domain might be related
 to the MH1 domain (see <PDOC51075>) [8,9].
