* Brix domain profile *
***********************

Analysis of  the  Brix  (biogenesis of ribosomes in Xenopus) protein leaded to
the identification  of  a  region  of 150-180 residues length, called the Brix
domain, which  is  found  in  six  protein  families:  one archaean family (I)
including hypothetical proteins (one per genome); and five eukaryote families,
each named according to a representative member and including close homologues
of this prototype: (II) Peter Pan (D. melanogaster) and SSF1/2 (S.cerevisiae);
(III) RPF1 (S. cerevisiae); (IV) IMP4 (S. cerevisiae); (V) Brix (X.laevis) and
BRX1 (S. cerevisiae); and (VI) RPF2 (S.cerevisiae).

Typically, a  protein  sequence  belonging  to  the  Brix  domain  superfamily
contains  a  highly charged N-terminal segment (about 50 residues) followed by
a single  copy of the Brix domain and another highly charged C-terminal region
(about  100 residues). The archaean sequences have two unique characteristics:
(1)  the charged regions are totally absent at the N-terminus and are  reduced
in number  to about 10 residues at the C-terminus; and (2) the C-terminal part
of the  Brix  domain  itself  is  minimal.  Two  eukaryote  groups  have large
insertions  within the  C-terminal  region: about 70 residues in the group III
and about  120  in  the  group  II.  Biological data for some proteins in this
family suggest a role in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA binding [1,2].

The profile we developed spans the entire Brix domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
