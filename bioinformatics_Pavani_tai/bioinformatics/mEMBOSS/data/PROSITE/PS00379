* CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases signature *
**************************************************

A number of  phosphatidyltransferases,  which are all involved in phospholipid
biosynthesis and that share the property of catalyzing the displacement of CMP
from a CDP-alcohol by a second alcohol with formation of a phosphodiester bond
and concomitant  breaking  of  a phosphoride  anhydride bond share a conserved
sequence region [1,2]. These enzymes are:

 - Ethanolaminephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.1) from yeast (gene EPT1).
 - Diacylglycerol  cholinephosphotransferase  (EC 2.7.8.2)  from  yeast  (gene
   CPT1).
 - Phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase  (EC 2.7.8.5)   (CDP-diacylglycerol--
   glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase) from bacteria (gene pgsA).
 - Phosphatidylserine synthase  (EC 2.7.8.8)    (CDP-diacylglycerol--serine O-
   phosphatidyltransferase) from  yeast (gene CHO1) and from Bacillus subtilis
   (gene pssA).
 - Phosphatidylinositol synthase  (EC 2.7.8.11)  (CDP-diacylglycerol--inositol
   3-phosphatidyltransferase) from yeast (gene PIS).

These  enzymes  are  proteins  of  from  200  to 400 amino acid residues.  The
conserved region contains  three aspartic  acid residues and is located in the
N-terminal section of the sequences.

-Consensus pattern: D-G-x(2)-A-R-x(7,8)-G-x(3)-D-x(3)-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
