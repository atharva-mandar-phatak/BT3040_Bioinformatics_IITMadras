*********************************************

Smad proteins  are  signal transducers and transcriptional comodulators of the
TGF-beta superfamily  of  ligands,  which  play a central role in regulating a
broad range of cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, and
specification of  developmental  fate, in diverse organisms from C. elegans to
humans. Ligand  binding  to  specific  transmembrane  receptor kinases induces
receptor oligomerization  and  phosphorylation  of  the receptor specific Smad
protein (R-Smad)  in  the  cytoplasm.  The  R-Smad  proteins regulate distinct
signaling pathways.  Smad1,  5 and 8 mediate the signals of bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs),  while  Smad2  and 3 mediate the signals of activins and TGF-
betas. Upon  ligand  stimulation,  R-Smad  proteins  are phosphorylated at the
conserved C-terminal  tail  sequence,  SS*xS*  (where S*  denotes  a  site  of
phosphorylation). The   phosphorylated   states   of   R-Smad   proteins  form
heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and are translocated into the nucleus. In the
nucleus, the  heteromeric  complexes  function  as gene-specific transcription
activators by  binding  to  promoters  and  interacting  with  transcriptional
coactivators. Smad6  and  Smad7 are inhibitory Smad proteins that inhibit TGF-
beta signaling by interfering with either receptor-mediated phosphorylation or
hetero-oligomerization between   Smad4  and  R-Smad  proteins.  Smad  proteins
comprise two  conserved  MAD homology domains, one in the N-terminus (MH1) and
one in the C-terminus (MH2), separated by a more variable, proline-rich linker
region. The  MH1 domain has a role in DNA binding and negatively regulates the
functions of   MH2   domain,   whereas  the  MH2  domain  is  responsible  for
transactivation and  mediates  phosphorylation-triggered  heteromeric assembly
between Smad4 and R-Smad [1,2].

The MH1  domain  adopts  a compact globular fold, with four alpha helices, six
short beta  strands,  and  five loops (see <PDB:1MHD>). The N-terminal half of
the sequence  consists  of  three  alpha  helices  ,  and  the C-terminal half
contains all  six  beta strands, which form two small beta sheets and one beta
hairpin. The  fourth  alpha  helix  is  located in the hydrophobic core of the
molecule, surrounded  by the N-terminal three alpha helices on one side and by
the two  small  beta  sheets  and  the  beta  hairpin on the other side. These
secondary structural  elements  are  connected  with  five intervening surface
loops. The  MH1  domain  employs a novel DNA-binding motif, a 11-residue beta-
hairpin formed  by  strands B2 and B3, to contact DNA in the major groove. Two
residues in  the  L3  loop and immediately preceding strand B2 also contribute
significantly to DNA recognition. The beta hairpin appears to protrude outward
from the globular MH1 core [1].

The MH2  domain  is  about  ~230  amino  acids in length and contains the SSxS
motif. The  MH2  domain is able to undergo phosphorylation-dependent homo- and
heterotrimerization. The  MH2  domain contains a central beta sandwich, with a
conserved three helix bundle (H3, H4, and H5) on one end and a conserved loop-
helix region (L1, L2, L3, and H1) on the other end (see <PDB:1DEV>) [2].

The profiles we developed cover the entire MH1 and MH2 domains.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: It  has  been  said that the MH1 domain is related to the CTF/NF-I DNA-
 binding domain (see <PDOC00361>) [3,4].
