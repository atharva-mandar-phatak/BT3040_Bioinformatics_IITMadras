*******************************************

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) (FBPase) [1], a regulatory enzyme in
gluconeogenesis,  catalyzes  the  hydrolysis  of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to
fructose 6-phosphate.  It is involved in many different metabolic pathways and
found in most organisms.

Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.37) (SBPase) [2] is an enzyme found
plant chloroplast and in photosynthetic bacteria that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of sedoheptulose  1,7-bisphosphate to sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, a step in the
Calvin's reductive   pentose   phosphate   cycle.   It   is  functionally  and
structurally related to FBPase.

In mammalian FBPase, a lysine residue has  been shown  to  be  involved in the
catalytic mechanism [3].  The  region  around this residue is highly conserved
and can be used as a signature pattern for FBPase and SBPase. It must be noted
that, in  some  bacterial FBPase sequences, the active site lysine is replaced
by an arginine.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-[RK]-[LI]-x(1,2)-[LIV]-[FY]-E-x(2)-P-[LIVM]-[GSA]
                    [K/R is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
