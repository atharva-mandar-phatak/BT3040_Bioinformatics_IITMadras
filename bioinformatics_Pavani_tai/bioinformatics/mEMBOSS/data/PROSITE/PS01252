* Endogenous opioids neuropeptides precursors signature *
*********************************************************

Vertebrate endogenous opioids neuropeptides are released by post-translational
proteolytic processing of precursor proteins. These precursor proteins consist
of a  signal  sequence  followed by a conserved region of about 50 residues, a
variable length  region  and  the sequence of the various neuropeptides. Three
types of precursors are currently known:

 - Preproenkephalin  A  (gene PENK) which is processed to produce the peptides
   Met-enkephalin (6 copies) and Leu-enkephalin,
 - Preproenkephalin  B  (gene PDYN) which is processed to produce the peptides
   neoendorphin, dynorphin, leumorphin, rimorphin and leu-enkephalin.
 - Prepronocipeptin  (gene  PNOC)  which  is processed to produce the peptides
   nociceptin (orphanin FQ) as well as two other potential neuropeptides.

The conserved  region  in  the  N-terminal  of  these  precursors contains six
cysteines that  are probably involved in disulfide bonds. This region could be
important for the processing of the neuropeptides [1].

-Consensus pattern: C-x(3)-C-x(2)-C-x(2)-[KRH]-x(6,7)-[LIF]-[DNS]-x(3)-C-x-
                    [LIVM]-[EQ]-C-[EQ]-x(8)-W-x(2)-C
                    [The 6 C's may be involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
