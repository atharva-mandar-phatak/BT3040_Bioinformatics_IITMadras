* Flagella basal body rod proteins signature *
**********************************************

Many bacterial species  swim  actively by means of flagella [1].  The flagella
organelle is made of three parts:  the basal body, the hook  and the filament.
The basal body consists of four rings (L,P,S, and M) mounted on a central rod.
In Salmonella typhimurium and related organisms the  rod has been shown [2] to
consist of  four different, yet evolutionary related proteins:  in  the distal
portion of the  rod  there  are  about  26 subunits of protein flgG and in the
proximal portion  there  are about 6 subunits each of proteins flgB, flgC, and
flgF.

These four proteins  contain  in  their N-terminal section  a highly conserved
asparagine-rich domain that we have used as a signature pattern.

This pattern is also found in:

 - Flagella hook protein flgE from Gram-negative bacteria.
 - Flagellar  hook-associated  protein  1  (HAP1)  (flgK)  from  Gram-negative
   bacteria.
 - Flagellar hook-basal body proteins flhO and flhP from Bacillus subtilis.
 - The  central  section  of  the  flagella  core  protein  (flaA) of Borrelia
   burgdorferi.

-Consensus pattern: [GTARYQ]-x-{R}-x(7)-[LIVMYSTA](2)-[GSTA]-[STADEN]-N-
                    [LIVM]-[SAN]-N-x-[SADENFR]-[STV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 3 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
