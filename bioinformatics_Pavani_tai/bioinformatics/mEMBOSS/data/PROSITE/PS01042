* Homoserine dehydrogenase signature *
**************************************

Homoserine dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.3)  (HDh)  [1,2]  catalyzes NAD-dependent
reduction of  aspartate  beta-semialdehyde into  homoserine.  This reaction is
the third step in a   pathway leading from aspartate to homoserine. The latter
participates in  the  biosynthesis of threonine and then isoleucine as well as
in that of methionine.

HDh is  found  either as a single chain protein as in some bacteria and yeast,
or as a bifunctional  enzyme consisting  of an N-terminal aspartokinase domain
and a  C-terminal  HDh  domain  as in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and in
plants.

As a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region of Hdh.  This is
a segment  of  23  to  24  residues  located  in  the central section and that
contains two conserved aspartate residues.
