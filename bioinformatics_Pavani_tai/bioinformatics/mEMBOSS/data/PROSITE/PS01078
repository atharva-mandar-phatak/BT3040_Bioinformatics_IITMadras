* Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis proteins signatures *
********************************************************

Eukaroytic and  prokaryotic  molybdoenzymes  require  a molybdopterin cofactor
(MoCF) for  their  activity.  The  biosynthesis  of  this  cofactor involves a
complex multistep  enzymatic  pathway. One of the eukaryotic proteins involved
in this pathway is the Drosophila protein cinnamon [1] which is highly similar
to gephyrin, a rat microtubule-associated protein  which was thought to anchor
the glycine  receptor  to  subsynaptic microtubules. Cinnamon and gephyrin are
evolutionary related,  in their  N-terminal half, to the Escherichia coli MoCF
biosynthesis proteins  mog/chlG  and moaB/chlA2 and, in their C-terminal half,
to Escherichia coli moeA/chlE.

As signature  patterns,  we selected two conserved regions: one located in the
N-terminal half, the other in the C-terminal half.
