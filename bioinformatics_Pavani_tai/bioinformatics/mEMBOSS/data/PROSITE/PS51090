* Cortactin repeat profile *
****************************

The  cortactin or HS1 repeat is a tandem repeat of 37-amino acid actin-binding
domains.  The repeat is named after human cortactin and HS1, proteins involved
in  cytoskeletal  rearrangements  implicated  in cell migration and apoptosis,
respectively.  Cortactin  contains  6.5  tandem  copies  of  the repeat and is
conserved  among metazoans, although e.g. insect cortactin and splice variants
contain  fewer  copies.  Hematopoietic  lineage  cell specific protein 1 (HS1)
contains  3.5 tandem copies of the cortactin repeat and is mainly expressed in
hematopoietic  cells.  Both  cortactin and HS1 contain a C-terminal SH3 domain
(see  <PDOC50002>).  The  cortactin  repeat  domain  binds  filamentous  actin
(F-actin)  in  proteins  that modulate the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton.
Secondary  structure  predictions  indicate  that  the  cortactin repeat could
exhibit a helix-turn-helix structure [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain a cortactin repeat domain:

 - Mammalian  cortactin  or oncogene EMS1 protein, a regulator of cytoskeleton
   remodeling  by  promoting  actin-related  protein  (Arp)2/3  mediated actin
   polymerization.
 - Human  hematopoietic  lineage cell specific protein 1 (HS1), a substrate of
   intracellular  protein  tyrosine kinases, implicated in the immune response
   to  extracellular stimuli and in cell differentiation induced by cytokines.
   HS1 is conserved among vertebrates.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the  entire cortactin repeat and has been
manually adapted to detect the partially matching region of C-terminal copies.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
