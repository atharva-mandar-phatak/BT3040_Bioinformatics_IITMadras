* Rrf2-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  rrf2-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about 130 residues present in transcription regulators of the rrf2
family.  This  family  of  bacterial  regulators  is named after Desulfovibrio
vulgaris    rrf2,    a   regulator   of   the   hmc   operon   which   encodes
iron-sulfur-containing proteins as well as other proteins involved in electron
transport [1,2]. Other rrf2-type HTH proteins are regulators of genes involved
in nitrite or iron metabolism, or nitric oxide detoxification.

The  N-terminal  part  of  the  domain  shows similarity to the iclR-type (see
<PDOC00807>),   the   gntR-type  (see  <PDOC00042>)  and  marR-type  HTH  (see
<PDOC00861>),  wherein the DNA-binding HTH motif is followed by a beta-hairpin
which  is  called the wing. The C-terminal part of the rrf2-type HTH domain in
most  cases  contains  3 conserved cysteine residues that may bind an [2Fe-2S]
cluster,  like  in  iscR and nsrR [3-8]. The nsrR regulator, which contains an
nitrogen-oxides-sensing  Fe-S  cluster  that  is  required for DNA binding, is
implicated  in  denitrification and/or NO detoxification in diverse pathogenic
and environmental bacteria.

Some proteins known to contain a rrf2-type HTH domain:

 - Desulfovibrio vulgaris protein rrf2, a repressor of the hmc operon encoding
   a cytochrome redox complex for electron transport from hydrogen to sulfate.
 - Escherichia  coli iscR (for iron-sulfur cluster regulator), a transcription
   repressor   of  the  isc  operon  encoding  Fe-S  assembly  proteins.  IscR
   reversibly  binds  a  [2Fe-2S]  cluster  and functions as an autoregulator.
   Demetallated  iscR  (apo-iscR)  acts  as  an  activator under oxidative and
   Fe-limited conditions.
 - Nitrosomonas  europaea nsrR, a nitrite sensitive transcription repressor of
   nitrite reductase, involved in detoxification of nitrite.
 - Escherichia coli nsrR, a nitric oxide sensitive transcription regulator  of
   genes  that  may protect the cell against NO-stress (NO is a damaging agent
   of Fe-S clusters).
 - Bacillus subtilis protein nsrR, a NO-responsive transcription regulator.
 - Streptomyces  coelicolor  nsrR,  a  transcription  regulator  containing an
   NO-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster that is required for DNA-binding.
 - Rhizobium leguminosarum rirA (rhizobial iron regulator), an iron-responsive
   regulator involved in Fe uptake.
 - Bacillus subtilis protein yrzC.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein Rv1287/MT1325.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 protein slr0846.

The  pattern we use to detect these proteins is located in the central part of
these proteins and covers the stronger conserved region [2], 'the wing', which
starts  directly C-terminal to the 'helix-turn-helix' motif of these proteins.
We  also  developed a profile that covers the entire rrf2-type wHTH, including
the C-terminal region which may bind an iron-sulfur cluster.
