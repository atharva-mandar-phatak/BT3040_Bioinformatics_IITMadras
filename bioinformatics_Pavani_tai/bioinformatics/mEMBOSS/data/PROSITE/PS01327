* Large-conductance mechanosensitive channels mscL family signature *
*********************************************************************

Mechanosensitive ion  channels  play  a  critical role in transducing physical
stresses at  the  cell  membrane into an electrochemical response. Prokaryotes
harbor a  large-conductance  mechanosensitive channel (gene mscL) [1] which is
opened by  membrane  stretch  force  and  may participate in the regulation of
osmotic pressure changes within the cell.

MscL is  a  protein  of  about  15  kD.  It  forms  a  channel  organized as a
homopentamer [2], with each subunit containing two transmembrane regions.

As a  signature  pattern, we selected the best conserved region. It is located
in the N-terminal region. It starts three residues before the beginning of the
first transmembrane domain and ends in the middle of that domain.

-Consensus pattern: [KR]-G-N-[LIVM](2)-D-[LIVM]-A-[LIVM]-[GA]-[LIVM](3)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
