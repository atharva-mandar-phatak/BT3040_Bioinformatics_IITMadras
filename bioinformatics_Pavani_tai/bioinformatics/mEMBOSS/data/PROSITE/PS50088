*****************************************************

Ankyrin repeats  (ANK)  are tandemly repeated modules of about 33 amino acids.
They occur  in  a  large  number  of functionally diverse proteins mainly from
eukaryotes. The  few  known  examples  from prokaryotes and viruses may be the
result of horizontal gene transfers [1].

Many ankyrin   repeat   regions  are  known  to  function  as  protein-protein
interaction domains.

The conserved  fold  of  the ankyrin repeat unit is known from several crystal
and solution structures, e.g. from:

 - p53-binding protein 53BP2 [2],
 - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19Ink4d [3],
 - Transcriptional regulator GABP-beta [4],
 - NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkB-alpha [5].

It has  been  described  as an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta-hairpin
and two alpha-helices [2].

Two profiles  were  developed  for  this  module,  the  first one picks up ANK
repeats while  the  second profile is 'circular' and will thus detect a region
containing adjacent ANK repeats.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the repeat profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the circular profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
