* Chitin-binding type-1 domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

Many  plants  respond  to pathogenic attack by producing defense proteins that
are   capable   of   reversible  binding  to  chitin,  an  N-acetylglucosamine
polysaccharide  present  in  the  cell  wall  of  fungi and the exoskeleton of
insects.  Most  of  these  chitin-binding proteins include a common structural
motif  of  30 to 43 residues organized around a conserved four-disulfide core,
known  as the chitin-binding domain type-1 [1]. The topological arrangement of
the four disulfide bonds is shown in the following figure:

The  structure  of several chitin-binding domain type-1 have been solved, (see
for  example  <PDB:1HEV>)  [2].  The  chitin-binding  site  is  localized in a
beta-hairpin  loop formed by the second disulfide bridge. Conserved serine and
aromatic  residues  associated  with  the  hairpin-loop  are essential for the
chitin-binding  activity  [3].  The chitin-binding domain type-1 displays some
structural   similarities   with   the   chitin-binding   domain  type-2  (see
<PDOC50940>).

Some  of  the  proteins  containing  a chitin-binding domain type-1 are listed
below:

 - A number of non-leguminous plant lectins.  The  best characterized of these
   lectins are the  three highly homologous wheat  germ  agglutinins (WGA-1, 2
   and 3).  WGA  is  an  N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylneuraminic  acid  binding
   lectin which structurally consists of a fourfold repetition of the 43 amino
   acid domain.  The same type of structure is found in a barley root-specific
   lectin as well as a rice lectin.
 - Plants  endochitinases  (EC  3.2.1.14)  from  class  IA  (see <PDOC00620>).
   Endochitinases are  enzymes  that  catalyze  the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4
   linkages of  N-acetyl  glucosamine  polymers  of  chitin.  Plant chitinases
   function as a defense against chitin containing fungal pathogens.  Class IA
   chitinases generally contain one copy of the chitin-binding domain at their
   N-terminal extremity.  An  exception  is  agglutinin/chitinase [4] from the
   stinging nettle Urtica dioica which contains two copies of the domain.
 - Hevein, a wound-induced protein found in the latex of rubber trees.
 - Win1 and win2, two wound-induced proteins from potato.
 - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit [5]. The  toxin  encoded by
   the linear plasmid pGKL1 is composed of three subunits:  alpha,  beta,  and
   gamma. The  gamma  subunit  harbors  toxin  activity and inhibits growth of
   sensitive yeast  strains  in  the  G1  phase  of  the cell cycle; the alpha
   subunit, which is proteolytically  processed from  a  larger precursor that
   also contains the beta subunit, is a chitinase (see <PDOC00839>).

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Note: Hevein  is a strong allergen which is implied in the allergy to natural
 rubber  latex  (NRL).  NLR  can  be  associated  to  hypersensitivity to some
 plant-derived  foods  (latex–fruit  syndrome).  An increasing number of plant
 sources,  such  as avocado, banana, chestnut, kiwi, peach, tomato, potato and
 bell  pepper,  have  been associated with this syndrome. Several papers [6,7]
 have  shown  that  allergen  cross-reactivity  is  due to IgE antibodies that
 recognize  structurally  similar  epitopes  on  different  proteins  that are
 closely  related.  One  of  these  family  is  plant defence proteins class I
 chitinase containing a type-1 chitin-binding domain.
