* Kringle domain signature and profile *
****************************************

Kringles [1,2,3]  are triple-looped, disulfide cross-linked domains found in a
varying number  of  copies,  in some serine proteases and plasma proteins. The
kringle domain has been found in the following proteins:

 - Apolipoprotein A (38 copies).
 - Blood coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) (1 copy).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (4 copies).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor like protein (4 copies) [4].
 - Hepatocyte growth factor activator [1] (once) [5].
 - Plasminogen (5 copies).
 - Thrombin (2 copies).
 - Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) (2 copies).
 - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (1 copy).

The schematic  representation  of the structure of a typical kringle domain is
shown below:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

Kringle domains  are thought to  play a  role  in  binding  mediators, such as
membranes, other   proteins   or  phospholipids,  and  in  the  regulation  of
proteolytic activity.   As a  signature pattern  for this type  of domain,  we
selected a  conserved  sequence that contains two of the cysteines invovled in
disulfide bonds.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-C-[RH]-[NS]-x(7,8)-[WY]-C
                    [The 2 C's are involved in a disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
