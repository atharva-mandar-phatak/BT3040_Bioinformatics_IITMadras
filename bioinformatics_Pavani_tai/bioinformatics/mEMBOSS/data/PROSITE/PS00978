***************************************************************

FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) (GPD) catalyzes
the conversion  of  glycerol-3-phosphate  into  dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In
bacteria [1]  it  is  associated  with  the utilization of glycerol coupled to
respiration. In  Escherichia coli, two isozymes are known: one expressed under
anaerobic conditions (gene glpA) and one in aerobic conditions (gene glpD). In
eukaryotes, a mitochondrial form of GPD participates in the glycerol phosphate
shuttle in conjunction with  an NAD-dependent cytoplasmic GPD (EC 1.1.1.8) [2,
3].

These enzymes  are  proteins  of  about  60  to 70 Kd which contain a probable
FAD-binding domain in their N-terminal extremity. The mammalian enzyme differs
from  the  bacterial  or  yeast proteins by having an  EF-hand calcium-binding
region (See <PDOC00018>) in its C-terminal extremity.

We developed  two  signature patterns. One based on the first half of the FAD-
binding  domain and one which corresponds to a conserved region in the central
part of these enzymes.
