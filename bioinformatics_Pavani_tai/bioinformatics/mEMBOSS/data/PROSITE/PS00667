*************************************************************

Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex
I  or  NADH-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase) is  an  oligomeric  enzymatic  complex
located  in the inner  mitochondrial membrane  which  also  seems  to exist in
the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).
Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex
there are fifteen which are located  in  the membrane part, seven of which are
encoded by the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of most species. The most
conserved of these organelle-encoded subunits is  known as subunit 1 (gene ND1
in mitochondrion, and NDH1 in chloroplast) and seems to contain the ubiquinone
binding site.

The ND1 subunit is highly  similar  to  subunit 4 of  Escherichia coli formate
hydrogenlyase (gene  hycD), subunit C of hydrogenase-4 (gene hyfC). Paracoccus
denitrificans NQO8  and  Escherichia  coli nuoH NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase
subunits also belong to this family [3].

We have developed two signature  patterns based  on  conserved regions of this
subunit.

-Consensus pattern: G-[LIVMFYKRSAQT]-[LIVMAGPF]-[QAM]-x-[LIVMFYCA]-x-D-[AGIM]-
                    [LIVMFTA]-[KS]-[LVMYSTI]-[LIVMFYGA]-x-[KRE]-[EQG]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for watermelon and Leishmania ND1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: P-F-D-[LIVMFYQN]-[STAGPVMI]-E-[GACS]-E-x(0,2)-[EQLN]-
                    [LIVMS]-x(1,2)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Pisaster ochraceus ND1, and tobacco NDH1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Patterns revised.
