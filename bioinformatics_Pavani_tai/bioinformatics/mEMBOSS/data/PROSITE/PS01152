************************************************
* Hypothetical hesB/yadR/yfhF family signature *
************************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Anabaena and related cyanobacteria protein hesB which  may  be required for
   nitrogen fixation.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yadR and HI1723, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydiC.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yfhF and HI0376, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv2204c.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1417.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1565.
 - A  hypothetical  protein  in  the  nifU  5'region  of  many nitrogen fixing
   bacteria.
 - Porphyra  purpurea chloroplast hypothetical protein in apcF-rps4 intergenic
   region.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YLL027W.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YPR067W.

These are  small  proteins  (106 to 135 amino-acid residues in bacteria, about
200 residues  in  fungi)  that contain a number of conserved regions. The most
noteworthy of  these  regions  is  located  in  the  C-terminal  extremity, it
contains two  conserved  cysteines.  We  have  used this region as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [FQ]-x-[LIVMFY]-x-[NH]-[PGT]-[NSKQR]-x(4)-C-x-C-[GSN]-x-S-
                    F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
