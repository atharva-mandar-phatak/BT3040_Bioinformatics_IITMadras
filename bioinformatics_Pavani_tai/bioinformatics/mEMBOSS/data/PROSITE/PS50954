* LEM and LEM-like domain profiles *
************************************

The LEM  (LAP2,  emerin, MAN1) domain is a globular module of approximately 40
amino acids,  which  is mostly found in the nucleoplasmic portions of metazoan
inner nuclear  membrane  proteins.  The  LEM  domain has been shown to mediate
binding to  BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor) and BAF-DNA complexes. BAF
dimers bind  to  double-stranded  DNA  non-specifically and thereby bridge DNA
molecules to form a large, discrete nucleoprotein complex [1,2,3].

The resolution  of the solution structure of the LEM domain reveals that it is
composed of  a  three-residue  N-terminal  helical turn and two large parallel
alpha helices  interacting  through a set of conserved hydrophobic amino acids
(see <PDB:1H9F>).  The  two  helices,  which  are connected by a long loop are
oriented at an angle of ~45 degree [3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a LEM domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1.
 - Vertebrate lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) or thymopoietin.
 - Mammalian  emerin  (EMD).  In human, defects in EMD are a cause of X-linked
   Emery-Dreifuss muscular    dystrophy   (X-EDMD),   an   X-linked   disorder
   characterized by  early  contractures,  muscle  wasting  and  weakness  and
   cardiomyopathy.
 - Xenopus laevis Smad1 antagonistic effector (SANE).
 - Drosophila melanogaster otefin (OTE).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans W01G7.5 protein.

All LAP2 isoforms share an N-terminal segment composed of a LEM domain that is
connected to  a  highly  divergent  LEM-like  domain  by a highly flexible 60-
residue linker.  The LEM-like globular domain has the same size and structural
fold (see  <PDB:1H9E>)  as the LEM domain, but has been shown to bind directly
to DNA [1,2,3,4].

The profiles we developed span the entire LEM and LEM-like domains.
