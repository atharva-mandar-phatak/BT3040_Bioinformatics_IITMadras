* ELM2 domain profile *
***********************

The ELM2  (EGL-27  and  MTA1 homology) domain was first described in Egl-27, a
Caenorhabditis elegans  protein  that  plays  a fundamental role in patterning
during embryonic  development  [1].  Most ELM2 domain-containing proteins also
possess a  SANT  domain,  implying a structural and/or functional relationship
between these  two  motifs.  Many proteins containing an ELM2 domain are known
components of  characterized transcription- and chromatin-regulatory complexes
containing one  or  more  histone  deacetylases  (HDACs).  The  evolutionarily
conserved ELM2  domain  has  been  shown  to  function  as  a  transcriptional
repression domain through recruitment of HDAC activity [2].

Some proteins known to contain a ELM2 domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  mesoderm induction early response 1 (MI-ER1), a nuclear protein
   that contains  an  N-terminal  acidic  domain  with  potent transcriptional
   activity.
 - Vertebrate CoREST, a developmental regulator.
 - Mammalian  metastasis-associated  protein  MTA1,  a  component  of the NURD
   complex, which   has   histone  deacetylase  and  ATP-dependent  nucleosome
   remodelling activities.
 - Mammalian  metastasis-associated  protein  MTA2, a component of a chromatin
   regulatory complex.
 - Mammalian metastasis-associated protein MTA3.
 - Drosophila melanogaster MTA1-like.
 - Drosophila melanogaster GRUNGE (Gug).
 - Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor Atro.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans Egl-27 and Egr-1. They are redundantly required for
   embryonic patterning.

The profile we developed covers the entire extended ELM2 domain [2].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
