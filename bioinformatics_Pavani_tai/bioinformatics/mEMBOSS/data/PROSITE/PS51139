* GTF2I-like repeat profile *
*****************************

The GTF2I-like  repeats  are  specific  to  the TFII-I family of transcription
factors and have a putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) structure with an unusually
large loop  of  around  40  residues.  The transcription factors of the TFII-I
family contain  both  a  putative  leucine zipper (LZ) and GTF2I-like repeats.
They are  the  main  candidates  for  the pathology of Wiliams-Beuren syndrome
(WBS), a  neurological  disorder  associated  with  physical,  behavioral, and
cognitive abnormalities.  GTF2I-like  repeats are likely to be involved in DNA
binding [1-5].

The highly  conserved  75 amino acids that constitute the core of the putative
HLH of  the GTF2I-like repeats are flanked on each side by 10 poorly conserved
residues [4].

Some proteins known to contain a GTF2I-like repeat are listed below:

 - Vertebrate GTF2I, containing an LZ and six GTF2I-like repeats.
 - Vertebrate  GTF2IRD1, containing an LZ and five GTF2I-like repeats, with an
   additional sixth  GTF2I  repeat  present  in  some  isoforms  of  the mouse
   ortholog.
 - Vertebrate GTF2IRD2, containing an LZ and two GTF2I-like repeats.

The profile we developed covers the entire GTF2I-like repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The GTF2I-like repeat has also been called I-repeat [3].
