*******************************************

Aldose 1-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.3) (mutarotase)  is  the  enzyme  responsible for
the anomeric interconversion of  D-glucose  and  other  aldoses  between their
alpha- and beta-forms.

The sequence of mutarotase from two bacteria,  Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and
Streptococcus thermophilus is available [1].  It has also been  shown that, on
the basis of  extensive sequence similarities, a  mutarotase domain seem to be
present in the C-terminal half of the fungal GAL10  protein  which encodes, in
the N-terminal part, for UDP-glucose 4-epimerase.

The best conserved region in  the  sequence of mutarotase is centered around a
conserved histidine residue which may be involved in the catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: [NS]-x-T-N-H-x-Y-[FW]-N-[LI]
                    [The H may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2004 / Text revised.
