* KID domain profile *
**********************

Transcriptional activators  are  believed  to  stimulate  gene  expression via
protein-protein interactions  with  the  basal  machinery.  The cAMP-regulated
transcription factor  CREB has been shown to stimulate target gene expression,
in part  by  associating  with  the coactivator paralogs p300 and CREB binding
protein (CBP).  The  CREB transactivation domain is bipartite, consisting of a
kinase-inducible domain  (KID)  and  a  glutamine-rich  constitutive activator
termed Q2  which  synergize to stimulate target gene expression in response to
cAMP. Ser-133  phosphorylation  of  CREB within the KID domain promotes target
gene activation  via complex formation with the KIX domain (see <PDB50952>) of
the CBP  and P300 coactivators, whereas concurrent phosphorylation of the CREB
KID domain  at  Ser-142  inhibits  transcriptional  induction. Phospho-Ser-133
stabilizes whereas   phospho-Ser-142   disrupts  secondary  structure-mediated
interactions between  CREB  and  CBP/P300.  The about 60-residue KID domain is
found associated  with  a basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain (see <PDOC00036>)
[1,2].

The solution  structure  of  the  KID:KIX complex reveals that the KID domain,
largely unstructured  in the free state, folds into two mutually perpendicular
helices, alphaA   and   alphaB,   upon   binding   to   the  KIX  domain  (see
<PDB:1KDX; B>),  allowing  the newly formed amphipathic helix alphaB in KID to
form extensive  contacts  with hydrophobic residues lining a central groove in
KIX (see  <PDB:1KDX>).  Phospho-Ser-133 forms direct contacts with residues in
KIX and  these  contacts are further stabilized by hydrophobic residues in the
KID domain  which  flank phospho-Ser-133. Phospho-Ser-142 was found to inhibit
complex formation  by  interfering with hydrophobic interactions between helix
alphaB in the KID domain and the hydrophobic groove in the KIX domain. Ser-142
phosphorylation may  additionally  destabilize  the  alphaB  helix and thereby
block binding  of  CREB  to  CBP/P300. The sequences of KID domains are highly
conserved throughout  the  region that interacts with the KIX domain, but show
little similarity  outside  this  region.  Many  of  the conserved amino acids
appear to  play  primarily  a  structural  role, facilitating formation of the
amphipathic alphaB  helix  and  preserving  the  hydrophobic contacts with the
binding groove of the KIX domain [2,3].

The profile we developed spans the entire KID domain.
