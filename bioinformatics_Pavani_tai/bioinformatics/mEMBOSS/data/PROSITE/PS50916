******************************
* Rab-binding domain profile *
******************************

Rab  are small GTPases implicated in vesicle trafficking. Like the other small
GTPases, Rab proteins act as molecular switches, with an active GTP-bound form
that  interacts  with its target or effector protein and an inactive GDP-bound
form. A subgroup of Rab effectors contain in their N-terminal part a conserved
region  of  around 70 amino acid residues, the Rab-binding domain (RabBD) . In
some Rab effector domains an atypical FYVE-type zinc finger is inserted in the
central part [1].

The  crystal  structure  of the Rab effector domain of Rabphilin-3A in complex
with Rab3A has been solved [2] (see <PDB:1ZBD>). The structure consists of two
long  helices  separated  by  an atypical FYVE-type zinc finger which adopts a
conformation  similar  to  classical  ones (see <PDOC50178>). The central zinc
finger  does  not  directly interact with Rab3A. The amino acids important for
this  interaction  are located around a short C-terminal motif (SGAWFF) and an
acidic cluster in the N-terminal area.

Proteins known to contain a Rab-binding domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Synaptotagmin-like  1  (SYTL1)  (exophilin  7).  Its Rab-binding
   domain does not contain an inclusive FYVE-type like zinc finger.
 - Mammalian  Synaptotagmin-like  2  (SYTL2)  (exophilin  4).  Its Rab-binding
   domain does not contain an inclusive FYVE-type like zinc finger.
 - Mammalian Synaptotagmin-like 3 (SYTL3) (exophilin 6).
 - Mammalian Synaptotagmin-like 4 (SYTL4) (exophilin 2 or granuphilin).
 - Mammalian Synaptotagmin-like 5 (SYTL5).
 - Animal Rabphilin-3A (exophilin 1).
 - Mammalian Noc2 protein, a rabphilin 3A-like protein without C2 domains.
 - Mammalian  Slp  homolog  lacking  C2  domains-a  (Slac2-a or exophilin 3 or
   melanophilin).
 - Mammalian  Slp  homolog  lacking C2 domains-b (Slac2-b or exophilin 5). Its
   Rab-binding domain does not contain an inclusive FYVE-type like zinc
   finger.
 - Mammalian  Slp  homolog lacking C2 domains-c (Slac2-c or MyRIP or Exophilin
   8).
 - Mammalian Rim1.
 - Animal Rim2, a family of neuronal Rab effectors.

The profile we developed covers the entire Rab-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
