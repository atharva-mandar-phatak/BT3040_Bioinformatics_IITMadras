**********************
* KEN domain profile *
**********************

The proteins  listed  below  share a common architecture with a protein kinase
homology domain (see <PDOC00100>) followed by an ~135-residue globular kinase-
extension nuclease (KEN) domain made of eight helices (see <PDB:2RIO>) [1]:

 - Mammalian  2-5A-dependent  RNase  or  RNase L (EC 3.1.26.-), an interferon-
   induced enzyme  implicated  in  both the molecular mechanisms of interferon
   action and  the  fundamental control of RNA stability. 2-5A-dependent RNase
   is a  unique  enzyme in that it requires 2-5A, unusual oligoadenylates with
   2',5'-phosphodiester linkages.  RNase  L is catalytically active only after
   binding to an unusual activator molecule containing a 5'-phosphorylated 2',
   5'-linked oligoadenylate  (2-5A),  in the N-terminal half. RNase L consists
   of three   domains,  namely  the  N-terminal  ankyrin  repeat  domain  (see
   <PDOC50088>), the  protein  kinase  homology domain, and the C-terminal KEN
   domain [2-4].
 - Eukaryotic  Ire1/Ern1,  an  ancient  transmembrane  sensor  of  endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress with dual protein kinase and ribonuclease activities.
   In repsonse  to  ER stress Ire1/Ern1 catalyzes the splicing of target mRNAs
   in a  spliceosome-independent  manner.  Ire1/Ern1 is a type 1 transmembrane
   receptor consisting  of  an  N-terminal  ER luminal domain, a transmembrane
   segment and  a  cytoplasmic  region.  The  cytoplasmic region encompasses a
   protein kinase domain followed by a C-terminal KEN domain [1,5].

The dimerization  of  the kinase domain activates the ribonuclease function of
the KEN domain [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire KEN domain.
