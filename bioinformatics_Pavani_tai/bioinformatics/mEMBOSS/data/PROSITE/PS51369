* TCP domain profile *
**********************

The TCP  domain has been named after its first characterized members (TB1, CYC
and PCFs).  So  far,  members of the TCP family have only been found in plants
and function  in  processes  related  to cell proliferation. The TCP domain is
probably involved in DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions [1].

The TCP  domain  is  predicted  to form a non-canonical basic-Helix-Loop-Helix
(bHLH). The main conserved features of the TCP domain are: two short stretches
of residues in the basic region, hydrophobic residues along the apolar face of
both alpha-helices,  a tryptophan in helix II, and a helix-breaking glycine in
the loop  between  the  helices.  However  the  residues  in  the loop and the
hydrophilic residues  of  the  helices  are not as well conserved. TCP domains
form two  subfamilies:  one  closely  related to CYC and TB1, and another more
related to  the  PCFs.  The  basic  region of the CYC/TB1 subfamily contains a
putative bipartite  nuclear  localization signal (NLS) (see <PDOC00015>) while
the basic  region  of the PCF subfamily contains only a portion of a bipartite
NLS [1].

Some proteins known to contain a TCP domain are listed below:

 - Antirrhinum  majus cycloidea (cyc). It is involved in the control of floral
   symmetry, a character that has changed many times during plant evolution.
 - Maize  teosinte  branched  1 (tb1). It controls developmental switches that
   contributed to the evolution of maize from its wild ancestor teosinte.
 - Rice PCF1 and PCF2, proteins that may bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers.
   These proteins  were  isolated  on  the  basis  of  their  ability  to bind
   specifically to  promoter  elements  of the rice gene for the proliferating
   cell nuclear  antigen, PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and cell
   cycle control.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana TCP2 and TCP3, which correlate with actively dividing
   regions of the floral meristem.

The profile we developed covers the entire TCP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
