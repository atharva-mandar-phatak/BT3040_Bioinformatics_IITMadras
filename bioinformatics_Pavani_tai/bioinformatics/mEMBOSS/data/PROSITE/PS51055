Signal transduction  by  T  and B cell antigen receptors and certain receptors
for Ig   Fc   regions   involves   a   conserved  sequence  motif,  termed  an
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). It is also found in the
cytoplasmic  domain  of  apoptosis  receptor.  Phosphorylation of the two ITAM
tyrosines  is  a critical event in signal transduction. All (p)2ITAMs, but not
their  nonphosphorylated  counterparts,  induced  extensive  protein  tyrosine
phosphorylation  in  permeabilized cells. After binding of the ligand, via SH2
domain  (see  <PDOC50001>),  phosphorylation of the two conserved tyrosines of
ITAM creates binding sites for downstream signaling molecules and thus enables
the initiation of signalling events. This phosphorylation was found to reflect
activation of  the  src  family  kinase  Lyn  and  Syk.  Different  ITAMs  may
preferentially activate  distinct  signaling  pathways  as  a  consequence  of
distinct SH2 effector binding preference [1,2]. Furthermore, in viruses, ITAMs
may play key roles in viral pathogenesis by regulating viral clearance, immune
cell activation,  immune  cell recruitment through binding of cellular kinases
and thereby down regulate their function [3].

This motif can be found in one to three copies and in association with the Ig-
like domain (see <PDOC50835>).

Proteins currently known to contain an ITAM motif are:

 - Mammalian  alpha and beta immunoglobulin proteins, TCR gamma receptors, FCR
   gamma receptors   subunits,   CD3  chains  receptors  and  NFAT  activation
   molecule.
 - Hantavirus cytoplasmic elements [3].

Two profiles  were  developed for this motif. The first one picks up mammalian
ITAM while the second one is specific to hantavirus ITAM motif.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The ITAM motif is also found in some strains of simian immunodeficiency
 virus, the  GP30  of  bovine  leukemia  virus,  the LMP2A of the Epstein-Barr
 virus, and the K1 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus but the
 low conservation of the motif in this viral species do not permit us to match
 them [3,4].
-Note: This  motif  has  been  variably referred in the literature as the TAM,
 ARH1, ARAM, YXXL and Reth motif, leading to great confusion [5].
