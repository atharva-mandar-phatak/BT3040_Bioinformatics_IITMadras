* Riboflavin synthase alpha chain lumazine-binding repeat profile *
*******************************************************************

Riboflavin  synthase  (RS-alpha)  catalyzes  the  biosynthesis  of  riboflavin
(vitamin B2) by dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine (Lum) (EC
2.5.1.9).  Riboflavin  synthases  of  bacteria  and fungi are structurally and
evolutionary related to antenna proteins involved in bioluminescence of marine
bacteria  [1,2]. These proteins seem to have evolved from the duplication of a
domain of about 100 residues, the lumazine-binding repeat.

The  3D  structure  of RS-alpha, which is an asymmetric homotrimer, shows that
both  domains form a 6-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel (see <PDB:1PKV>) [3],
while  a C-terminal helix is involved in trimerization. The Lum-binding domain
of  RS-alpha  forms two Greek-key folds with the topology BBHBBBHB, where most
of  the substrate binding sites are located in beta-strands (B) 4 and 5 and in
helix (H) 2 [3-5].

Some proteins known to contain a lumazine-binding repeat:

 - Riboflavin  synthase  alpha  chain  (EC  2.5.1.9) (gene ribC in Escherichia
   coli,  ribB  in  Bacillus  subtilis  and Photobacterium leiognathi, RIB5 in
   yeast).  This  enzyme  synthesizes  riboflavin from two molecules of Lum, a
   pteridine-derivative.
 - Photobacterium phosphoreum lumazine  protein (LumP) (gene luxL).  LumP is a
   protein that  modulates  the  color  of  the  bioluminescence  emission  of
   bacterial luciferase. In the presence of LumP, light emission is shifted to
   higher energy  values (shorter wavelength). LumP  binds  non-covalently  to
   6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine.
 - Vibrio fischeri  yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (gene luxY).  Like  LumP,
   YFP modulates  light  emission  but  towards a longer wavelength. YFP binds
   non-covalently to FMN.

The profile we developed covers the entire lumazine-binding repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
