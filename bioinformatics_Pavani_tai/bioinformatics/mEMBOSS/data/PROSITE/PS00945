* Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunits signatures *
***********************************************************

Cyclin-dependent kinases  (CDK)  are  protein  kinases  which  associate  with
cyclins to  regulate  eukaryotic  cell cycle progression.  The most well known
CDK is p34-cdc2 (CDC28 in yeast) which is required  for entry into S-phase and
mitosis. CDK's  bind  to  a  regulatory  subunit  which is essential for their
biological function.  This regulatory  subunit is a small protein of 79 to 150
residues. In  yeast  (gene  CKS1)  and  in  fission yeast (gene suc1) a single
isoform is known, while mammals have two highly related isoforms.

It has  been  shown  [1]  that  these  CDK regulatory subunits  assemble as an
hexamer which  then acts as a hub for the oligomerization of six CDK catalytic
subunits.

The sequence  of  CDK regulatory subunits are highly conserved and we used the
two most conserved regions as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: Y-S-x-[KR]-Y-x-[DE](2)-x-[FY]-E-Y-R-H-V-x-[LV]-[PT]-[KRP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-P-E-x-H-[IV]-L-L-F-[KR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Patterns and text revised.
