* Zinc finger integrase-type profile *
**************************************

The  retroviral integrase is the enzyme responsible for the insertion of a DNA
copy  of  the viral genome into host DNA, an essential step in the replication
cycle  of  viruses  [1].  Integrases  comprise three functional and structural
domains:  the  central  core  domain,  which  contains  the catalytic site, an
N-terminal  zinc  finger  and  a  C-terminal  DNA binding domain [2]. The zinc
finger has the signature of zinc-binding residues H-x(3)-H-x(23)-C-x(2)-C. The
function  of  this  domain is unclear; however, it is required for integration
activity  and  enhances  tetramerization  in  the  context  of the full-length
integrase [3].

The  structure  of  this domain has been solved [3], it comprises four helices
(see  <PDB:1WJA>).  The  fold  is  very similar to that of a number of HTH DNA
binding  motifs,  with  helices  2  and 3 corresponding to the HTH motif . The
third helice is used for dimerization, whereas in the HTH motif it binds DNA.

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.
