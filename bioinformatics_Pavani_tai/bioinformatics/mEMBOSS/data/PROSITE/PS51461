* Fibrillar collagen C-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) domain profile *
**********************************************************************

Collagens represent  a  large  family  of  extracellular matrix glycoproteins.
Members of  this family include the fibrillar collagens, which are involved in
the formation  of  striated fibrils. Fibril-forming or fibrillar collagens are
one of the most ancient families of extracellular matrix molecules being found
throughout the  metazoan kingdom from the simplest (porifera (sponges)) to the
most complex   animals  (vertebrates).  Fibrillar  collagens  form  the  major
structural elements in extracellular matrices as diverse as the evolutionarily
"primitive" mesoglea  of  cnidarians  to  the  highly  specialized  connective
tissues of  vertebrates  (e.g.  bone,  cartilage, skin, and tendon). Molecular
features shared  by  all  members of this family include a highly conserved C-
terminal non-collagenous  (NC1)  domain or C-propeptide and a long collagenous
domain of ~1000 amino acid residues. The NC1 domain is the most conserved part
of fibrillar  collagens from invertebrates to vertebrates (types I-III, V, XI,
XXIV and  XXVII)  [1,2,3].  Fibrillar  collagen  NC1  domains  have  also been
identified in  choanoflagelates, which are considered the closest relatives of
metazoans [4,5].

The profile we developed covers the entire fibrillar collagen NC1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
