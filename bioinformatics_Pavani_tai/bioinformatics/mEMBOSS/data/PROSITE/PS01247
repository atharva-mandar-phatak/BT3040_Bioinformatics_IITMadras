********************************************************************

Inosine-uridine preferring  nucleoside  hydrolase  (EC 3.2.2.1) (IU-nucleoside
hydrolase or  IUNH)  is  an  enzyme  first  identified  in  protozoan [1] that
catalyzes the hydrolysis of all of the commonly occuring purine and pyrimidine
nucleosides into  ribose  and  the  associated  base, but has a preference for
inosine and  uridine  as  substrates.  This  enzyme  is  important  for  these
parasitic organisms,  which  are  deficient in de novo synthsis of purines, to
salvage the host purine nucleosides.

IUNH from  Crithidia  fasciculata  has been sequenced and characterized, it is
an homotetrameric  enzyme of subunits of 34 Kd. An histidine has been shown to
be important  for  the catalytic mechanism, it acts a proton donor to activate
the hypoxanthine leaving group.

IUNH is  evolutionary  related  to  a  number of uncharacterized proteins from
various biological sources, notably:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yaaF.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybeK.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiK.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC17G8.02.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR400w.
 - An hypothetical protein from the archaebacteria Desulfurolobus ambivalens.

As a  signature  pattern  for  these  proteins, we selected a highly conserved
region located   in  the  N-terminal  extremity.  This  region  contains  four
conserved aspartates that have been shown [2] to be located in the active site
cavity.

-Consensus pattern: D-x-D-[PT]-[GA]-x-D-D-[TAV]-[VI]-A
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / First entry.
