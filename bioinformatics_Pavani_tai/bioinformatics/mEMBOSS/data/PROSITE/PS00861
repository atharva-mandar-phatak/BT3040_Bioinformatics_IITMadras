* Galanin signature *
*********************

Galanin [1,2,3] is a neuropeptide that controls various biological activities:
it regulates  the  release growth hormone, inhibits the release of insulin and
somatostatin, contracts    smooth   muscle   of   the   gastrointestinal   and
genitourinary tract and may be involved in the control of adrenal secretion.

Galanin is  a 29 amino acid peptide processed from a larger precursor protein.
Except in human, galanin is C-terminally amidated.

A galanin-like peptide (GALP) has recently been identified [4].

The sequence  is  of galanin and of GALP are highly conserved and the first 13
residues are  identical in all currently known sequences. We have used this N-
terminal sequence as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-W-T-L-N-S-A-G-Y-L-L-G-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: February 2002 / Pattern and text revised.
