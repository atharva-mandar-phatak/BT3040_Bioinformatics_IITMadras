* MyTH4 domain profile *
************************

The myosin  tail  homology  4 (MyTH4) domain is a ~150 amino acid module which
has been  identified  in different branches of the myosin superfamily and in a
microtubule motor   protein   from  plants  (kinesin-like  calmodulin  binding
protein; KLCBP) [1]. The MyTH4 domain is found in one or two copies associated
with other   domains,   such   as   myosin  head,  kinesin  motor,  FERM  (see
<PDOC00566>), PH   (see  <PDOC50003>),  SH3  (see  <PDOC50002>)  and  IQ  (see
<PDOC50096>). The  function of the MyTH4 domain is presently unknown, although
its presence   in   several  different  putative  motor  proteins  raises  the
possibility that  different  motor proteins might share similar mechanisms for
targeting or regulation [2].

The MyTH4  is  predicted  to be largely alpha-helical, interrupted by three or
four turns. The MyTH4 domain contains four highly conserved regions designated
MGD (consensus  sequence L(K/R)(F/Y)MGDhP, LRDE (consensus LRDEhYCQhhKQHxxxN),
RGW (consensus   RGWxLh),   and  ELEA  (RxxPPSxhELEA),  where  h  indicates  a
hydrophobic residue and x is any residue [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire MyTH4 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
