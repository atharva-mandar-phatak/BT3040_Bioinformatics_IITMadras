* Protein secY signatures *
***************************

The eubacterial secY protein [1] plays an important role in protein export. It
interacts with the signal sequences of  secretory proteins as well as with two
other  components of the protein translocation system: secA and secE.  SecY is
an integral  plasma membrane protein  of  419 to 492  amino acid residues that
apparently  contains ten  transmembrane  segments.  Such  a structure probably
confers to secY a 'translocator' function, providing a channel for periplasmic
and outer-membrane precursor proteins.

Homologs of  secY  are  found in archaebacteria [2].  SecY  is also encoded in
the chloroplast  genome  of  some algae [3]  where  it  could be involved in a
prokaryotic-like protein  export  system  across  the  two  membranes  of  the
chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER) which  is  present in  chromophyte and
cryptophyte algae.

In eukaryotes,  the  evolutionary related protein sec61-alpha plays a role  in
protein translocation  through  the  endoplasmic  reticulum;  it  is part of a
trimeric complex that also consist of sec61-beta and gamma [4].

We have  developed  two   signature patterns  for  secY  proteins.  The  first
corresponds to   the second  transmembrane region, which is the most conserved
section of  these proteins. The second spans the C-terminal part of the fourth
transmembrane region,   a short intracellular loop, and the N-terminal part of
the fifth transmembrane region.
