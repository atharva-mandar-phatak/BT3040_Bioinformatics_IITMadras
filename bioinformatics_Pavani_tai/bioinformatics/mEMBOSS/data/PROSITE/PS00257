* Bombesin-like peptides family signature *
*******************************************

Bombesin-like peptides    comprise  a  large  family  of  peptides  which were
initially isolated  from amphibian skin,  where they  stimulate smooth  muscle
contraction. They  were  later  found  to  be widely  distributed in mammalian
neural and  endocrine cells.   The  amphibian peptides  which  belong to  this
family are currently classified into three subfamilies [1,2]:

 - The Bombesin group, which includes bombesin and alytesin.
 - The Ranatensin  group,  which  includes ranatensins,  litorin,  and  Rohdei
   litorin.
 - The Phyllolitorin group, which includes Leu(8)- and Phe(8)-phyllolitorins.

In mammals and birds two categories of bombesin-like peptides are known [3,4]:

 - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which stimulates the release of gastrin as
   well as other gastrointestinal hormones.
 - Neuromedin B (NMB), a neuropeptide whose function is not yet clear.

Bombesin-like peptides, like  many other  active peptides, are  synthesized as
larger protein  precursors  that are  enzymatically converted to  their mature
forms. The  final peptides are eight to fourteen residues long. As a signature
pattern, we  have  chosen  the  last   seven residues in the C-terminal, which
are conserved and are essential for the biological activity.

-Consensus pattern: W-A-x-G-[SH]-[LF]-M
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In positions 5 to 6 of the pattern, bombesins and GRP have His-Leu, NMB
 and ranatensins have His-Phe, and phyllolitorins have Ser-(Leu or Phe).
