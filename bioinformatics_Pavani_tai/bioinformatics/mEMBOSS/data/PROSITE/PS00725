* Germin family signature *
***************************

Germins and  germin-like  proteins  [1,2] are a family of hexameric ubiquitous
plant glycoproteins.   They  are  not  restricted  to  germinating  grains  as
initially sought  and  thereof  called 'germins', but they exist in all organs
and developmental  stages.  All  are  at  least  partly  associated  with  the
extracellular matrix.

A wide  range  of  function  has  been  uncovered  for germins and germin-like
proteins: some   act  as  oxalate  oxidases  (EC  1.2.3.4)  or  as  superoxide
dismutase (EC  1.15.1.1),  while  others  seems  to  be structural proteins or
receptors for auxins or proteins.

Germins and  germin-like  proteins are highly similar to slime mold spherulins
1a and 1b which are proteins that accumulate specifically during spherulation,
a process  induced  by  various  forms  of environmental stress which leads to
encystment and dormancy.

As a  signature  pattern we selected the best conserved region: 14 amino acids
located in  the  central section of these proteins. This region contains three
residues most probably implicated in the binding of a manganese ion [3].

-Consensus pattern: G-x(4)-H-x-H-P-x-[AGS]-x-E-[LIVM]
                    [The 2 H's and the E are manganese ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 6.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
