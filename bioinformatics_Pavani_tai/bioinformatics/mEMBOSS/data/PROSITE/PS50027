* Laminin-type EGF-like (LE) domain signature and profile *
***********************************************************

Laminins [1]  are  the  major  noncollagenous components of basement membranes
that mediate  cell  adhesion,  growth migration, and differentiation. They are
composed of  distinct  but  related  alpha,  beta  and gamma chains. The three
chains form a cross-shaped molecule that consist of a long arm and three short
globular arms.  The long arm consist of a coiled coil structure contributed by
all three chains and cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds.

Beside different types of globular domains each subunit contains, in its first
half, consecutive repeats of about 60 amino acids in length that include eight
conserved cysteines [2]. The tertiary structure (see <PDB:1KLO>) [3,4] of this
domain  is  remotely  similar in its N-terminal to that of the EGF-like module
(see  <PDOC00021>).  It  is known as a 'LE' or 'laminin-type EGF-like' domain.
The  number  of  copies of the LE domain in the different forms of laminins is
highly variable; from 3 up to 22 copies have been found.

A schematic  representation  of  the  topology  of the four disulfide bonds in
the LE domain is shown below.

In additions to laminins, the LE domain is also found in:

 - Agrin, a basal lamina protein  that causes the aggregation of acetylcholine
   receptors on cultured muscle fibers. It consists of 9 Kazal-like domains, 2
   LE domains, and 4 EGF-like domains.
 - Perlecan,  a  multidomain  basement  membrane  heparan sulfate proteoglycan
   composed of  4  LDLRA  domains,  3  LamB  domains, 12 LE domains, 14-21 IG-
   like domains, 3 LamG domains, and 4 EGF-like domains.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  basement membrane proteoglycan unc-52, which seems
   to be involved in myofilament assembly and/or attachment of the myofilament
   lattice to  the  cell membrane. The modular architecture is similar to that
   of perlecan;  it  consists of 3 LDLRA domains, 2 LamB domains, 7 LE domains
   and 16 IG-like domains.
 - Netrins,  proteins  that  control  guidance of CNS commissural axons at the
   midline and    peripheral  motor  axons. An homolog of netrin is UNC-6 from
   Caenorhabditis  elegans,  a  component  of an extracellular matrix cue that
   guides  dorso-ventral  migrations  on the epidermis. UNC-6 is required  for
   the guidance  of  pioneer  axons  and  migrating cells along the body wall.
   Netrins and UNC-6 are composed of a  laminin N-terminal domain (domain VI),
   3 LE domains and a complement C3/4/5 C-terminal domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  proteins  C54D1.5 and K08C7.3, which
   both contain  a  laminin  N-terminal  domain  (domain VI), 10.5 and 21.5 LE
   domains and a laminin domain IV.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  protein F33C8.1, that contain two LE
   domains and 3 EGF-like domains.

In mouse laminin gamma-1 chain, the seventh LE domain has been shown to be the
only one that binds with a high affinity to nidogen [5]. The binding-sites are
located on   the  surface  within  the  loops  C1-C3  and  C5-C6  [3,4].  Long
consecutive arrays of LE domains in laminins form rod-like elements of limited
flexibility [1],  which  determine  the  spacing  in  the formation of laminin
networks of basement membranes [6,7].

We  derived  a signature pattern for the LE domain which covers the C-terminal
half  of  the  repeat  starting  with  the  fourth conserved cysteine. We also
developed a profile that covers the whole LE domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(1,2)-C-x(5)-G-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(3,4)-[FYW]-x(3,15)-C
                    [The 5 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Most,  but  not  all  LE domains in a given protein are detected by the
 pattern.
