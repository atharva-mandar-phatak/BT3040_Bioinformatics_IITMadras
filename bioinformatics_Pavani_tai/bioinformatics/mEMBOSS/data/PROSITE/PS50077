* HEAT repeat profile *
***********************

The HEAT  repeat  is  a  tandemly  repeated,  37-47  amino  acids  long module
occurring in  a number of cytoplasmic proteins, including the four name-giving
proteins huntingtin,  elongation  factor  3  (EF3), the 65 Kd alpha regulatory
subunit of  protein  phosphatase  2A (PP2A) and the yeast PI3-kinase TOR1 [1].
Arrays of  HEAT  repeats  consists of 3 to 36 units forming a rod-like helical
structure and  appear  to function as protein-protein interaction surfaces. It
has been  noted  that  many  HEAT  repeat-containing  proteins are involved in
intracellular transport processes.

In the crystal structure of PP2A PR65/A [2], the HEAT repeats consist of pairs
of antiparallel alpha helices.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
