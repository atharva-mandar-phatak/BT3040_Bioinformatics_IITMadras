* Signal peptidases I signatures *
**********************************

Signal peptidases (SPases) [1]  (also  known  as leader peptidases) remove the
signal peptides from secretory proteins.  In prokaryotes three types of SPases
are known: type I (gene lepB) which is responsible for  the  processing of the
majority  of  exported pre-proteins;  type II (gene lsp)  which  only  process
lipoproteins, and a third type involved in the processing of pili subunits.

SPase I (EC 3.4.21.89) is an integral membrane protein that is anchored in the
cytoplasmic membrane  by  one (in B. subtilis)  or two (in E. coli) N-terminal
transmembrane domains  with  the  main  part  of the protein  protuding in the
periplasmic space. Two residues have  been shown [2,3] to be essential for the
catalytic activity of SPase I: a serine and an lysine.

SPase I  is  evolutionary  related  to  the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane
protease subunit 1  and 2 (genes IMP1 and IMP2) which  catalyze the removal of
signal peptides  required for the targeting of proteins from the mitochondrial
matrix, across the inner membrane, into the inter-membrane space [4].

In eukaryotes the removal  of signal  peptides  is  effected  by an oligomeric
enzymatic complex composed  of  at  least  five subunits: the signal peptidase
complex (SPC).  The SPC is located in the endoplasmic  reticulum membrane. Two
components  of mammalian SPC, the 18 Kd (SPC18) and the 21 Kd (SPC21) subunits
as well as  the yeast SEC11 subunit  have   been shown [5] to share regions of
sequence similarity with prokaryotic SPases I and yeast IMP1/IMP2.

We have developed  three  signature  patterns  for  these proteins.  The first
signature contains  the  putative active site  serine,  the  second  signature
contains the putative active  site  lysine  which  is not conserved in the SPC
subunits, and the third signature corresponds to a conserved region of unknown
biological significance  which  is  located  in  the C-terminal section of all
these proteins.
