* Diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) profile *
**************************************************

Formins participate in the assembly of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
in    processes    like    cell    division,   migration,   and   development.
Diaphanous-related  formins  (DRF) contain an N-terminal GTPase-binding domain
(GBD)  and  a  C-terminal  diaphanous  autoregulatory  domain  (DAD). DRFs are
regulated  by an autoinhibitory interaction of the C-terminal DAD with the DRF
N-terminal  armadillo  repeat-like  region  (see  <PDOC50176>)  in  the DID or
GBD/FH3 domain [1-3]. This autoinhibition is released upon competitive binding
of  an  activated  Rho  GTPase  to  the  GBD.  The  release  of DAD allows the
catalytical  formin  homology  2  (FH2)  domain  to then nucleate and elongate
nonbranched actin filaments.

The  DAD  domain  is a ~32 amino acid autoinhibitory domain, which facilitates
intramolecular  binding.  The  DAD  core forms an alpha-helical structure (see
<PDB:2BAP; D>)  [3, 4]  and the C-terminal part of the domain contains several
basic residues that form a basic region [5, 6].

Some proteins known to contain a DAD domain:

 - Fruit  fly  protein  diaphanous,  which  plays  an  important  role  during
   cytokinesis.
 - Mammalian  diaphanous-related  formins  (DRF)  1-3, which act as Rho GTPase
   effectors during cytoskeletal remodeling.
 - Baker's yeast proteins BNI1 and BNI1-related protein 1 (BNR1).
 - Aspergillus  nidulans  cytokinesis  protein sepA, which participates in two
   actin-mediated processes, septum formation and polarized growth.
 - Mammalian disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) proteins.
 - Mammalian  formin-like  1 protein (Fmnl1) or formin-related protein gene in
   leukocytes (FRL).

The profile we developed covers the entire DAD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
