* Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) signature *
*****************************************

Nitric oxide  synthase (EC 1.14.13.39) (NOS) enzymes produce nitric oxide (NO)
by  catalyzing a five-electron oxidation of a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine
(L-Arg).  Oxidation  of  L-Arg  to  L-citrulline  occurs  via  two  successive
monooxygenation   reactions   producing   N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine   as  an
intermediate.  2  mol of O(2) and 1.5 mol of NADPH are consumed per mole of NO
formed [1,E1].

Arginine-derived  NO  synthesis  has  been identified in mammals, fish, birds,
invertebrates, plants, and bacteria [1]. Best studied are mammals, where three
distinct  genes  encode  NOS  isozymes:  neuronal  (nNOS  or NOS-1), cytokine-
inducible  (iNOS  or NOS-2) and endothelial (eNOS or NOS-3) [2]. iNOS and nNOS
are  soluble  and  found  predominantly in the cytosol, while eNOS is membrane
associated.  The  enzymes  exist as homodimers, each monomer consisting of two
major  domains:  an N-terminal oxygenase domain, which belongs to the class of
heme-thiolate proteins, and a C-terminal reductase domain, which is homologous
to  NADPH:P450  reductase  (EC  1.6.2.4).  The  interdomain linker between the
oxygenase  and reductase domains contains a calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence.
NOSs are   the  only  enzymes  known  to  simultaneously  require  five  bound
cofactors/prosthetic groups: FAD, FMN, heme, tetrahydrobiopterin and Ca2+-CaM.
The animal  NOS  isozymes are catalytically self-sufficient. The electron flow
in the NO synthase reaction is: NADPH --> FAD --> FMN --> heme --> O(2).

eNOS  localisation  to  endothelial  membranes  is mediated by cotranslational
N-terminal myristoylation    (see    <PDOC00008>)    and    post-translational
palmitoylation [3]. The subcellular localisation of nNOS in skeletal muscle is
mediated by  anchoring  of  nNOS to dystrophin. nNOS contains an additional N-
terminal domain, the PDZ domain (see <PDOC50106>) [4].

Some  bacteria,  like  Bacillus  halodurans,  Bacillus subtilis or Deinococcus
radiodurans, contain homologs of NOS oxygenase domain.

The pattern is directed against the N-terminal heme binding site.
