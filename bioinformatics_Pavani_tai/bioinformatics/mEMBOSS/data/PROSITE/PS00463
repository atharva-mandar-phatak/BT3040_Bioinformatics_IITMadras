* Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
*****************************************************************

A number of fungal transcriptional activator proteins contain a  cysteine-rich
region that  binds  DNA  in  a zinc-dependent fashion. It has been shown [1,2]
that this  region forms a binuclear zinc cluster where six conserved cysteines
bind two zinc cations. Some proteins known to contain such a domain are listed
below [3].

The spacing of the cysteines in this  type of domain is C-x(2)-C-x(6)-C-x(5 to
12)-C-x(2)-C-x(6 to 8)-C.  There  are also a number of other conserved residues
in the loop regions  between the cysteines  which can be used to help define a
specific pattern  for  such  a  domain. This domains is generally found in the
N-terminal section  of  these  proteins with the exception of UME6 where it is
found in the C-terminal section.
