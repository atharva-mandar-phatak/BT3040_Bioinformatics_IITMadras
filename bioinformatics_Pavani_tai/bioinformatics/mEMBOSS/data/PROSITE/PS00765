*********************************************************************

Glucose-6-phosphate  isomerase  (GPI) (EC 5.3.1.9) or phosphoglucose isomerase
(PGI) [1,2] is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of
glucose-6-phosphate  and  fructose-6-phosphate.  PGI  is involved in different
pathways: in most higher organisms it is involved in glycolysis; in mammals it
is  involved  in  gluconeogenesis;  in plants in carbohydrate biosynthesis; in
some  bacteria  it  provides a gateway for fructose into the Entner-Doudouroff
pathway.  Besides it's role as a glycolytic enzyme, mammalian PGI can function
as  a  tumor-secreted  cytokine and an angiogenic factor (AMF) that stimulates
endothelial   cell   motility.  Mammalian  PGI  is  also  neuroleukin  [3],  a
neurotrophic factor which supports the survival of various types of neurons.

The  sequence  of PGI is conserved among diverse species ranging from bacteria
to  mammals  and  structures  form  a  similar  fold  (see  <PDB:1IAT>) [4,5],
comprised  of two subdomains that each form an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, with
the  active  site located in the cleft between the subdomains and on the dimer
interface.  A  glutamate  and a lysine residue as well as a histidine from the
other  protomer  in  the  dimer are implicated in the catalytic mechanism. The
structure resembles that of the SIS domain (see <PDOC51464>).

As  signature  patterns for this enzyme we selected two conserved regions, the
first region is located in the central section of PGI, while the second one is
located in its C-terminal section. We also developed a profile that covers the
entire PGI.
