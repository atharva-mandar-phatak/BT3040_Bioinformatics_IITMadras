* MABP domain profile *

A key  aspect  of eukaryotic intracellular trafficking is the sorting of cell-
surface proteins  into  multi-vesicular  endosomes  or  bodies  (MVBs),  which
eventually fuse  with  the  lysosome,  where  they are degraded by lipases and
peptidases. This is the primary mechanism for down-regulation of signaling via
transmembrane receptors   and  removal  of  misfolded  or  defective  membrane
proteins. This  process  is  also  utilized by several viruses (e.g. HIV-1) to
facilitate budding of their virions from the cell-membrane. Studies in animals
and fungi  have  shown that it depends on an intricate series of interactions,
which is   initiated   via   ubiquitination   (typically  one  or  more  mono-
ubiquitinations) of  the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins by specific E3
ligases. Ubiquitinated  membrane  proteins are then captured into endosomes by
the ESCRT system and prevented from being recycled back to the plasma membrane
via the  retrograde  trafficking  system.  The  ESCRT  system  also  folds the
endosomal membranes   into   invaginations  that  are  concentrated  in  these
ubiquitinated targets  and  catalyzes  their  abscission  into  intra-luminal-
vesicles inside  the  endosome.  This largely seals the fate of these membrane
proteins as  targets  for lysosomal degradation. The ESCRT system is comprised
of 4  major  protein  complexes,  ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-III, which are successively
involved in the above-described steps [1].

ESCRT-I contains  three subunits that are conserved between yeast and animals,
namely the   inactive   E2-ligase   protein  TSG101/VPS23,  VPS28  and  VPS37.
Additionally, both  yeast and metazoan ESCRT-I contain a fourth subunit termed
MVB12 (“multivesicular  body  sorting  factor  of  12 kD”); however, the MVB12
subunits from  the  two  lineages do not show significant sequence similarity.
The metazoan  MVB12 proteins contain two distinct conserved domains that occur
independently in  various  proteins.  The N-terminal region of MVB12 forms the
MVB12-associated beta-prism  (MABP),  which  is also found in DENND4A/B/C from
vertebrates, the   membrane   trafficking   regulator  Crag  from  Drosophila,
bacterial proteins  typified  by the MAC/perforin (MACPF)-like protein plu1415
from Photorhabdus    luminescens    and    uncharacterized    proteins    from
choanoflagellates and stamenopiles. It has been suggested that the MABP domain
has a  membrane-associated  function,  perhaps even specific interactions with
membrane components.  It  is  plausible  that  the eukaryotic MABP domains are
adaptators that  help  linking  other  associated  domains  found  in the same
polypeptide to vesicular membranes [1].

The MABP domain has an internal repeat structure of three homologous segments.
Consitent with    this,    the   structurally   characterized   representative
Photorhabdus plu1415,  showed  that  this  region  precisely  corresponds to a
type-I beta-prism domain with an internal three fold symetry (see <PDB:2QP2>).
Each of  the  three  sub-domains  of the beta-prism structure is a distinctive
three-stranded beta-sheet.  The  MABP  domain shares a triradial symmetry with
beta-sheets parallel to the prism axis. The beta-prism fold is associated with
membrane interaction.  The  majority  of  the  eukaryotic MABP domain versions
contain a  conserved  cysteine  in  the first and third subdomain of the beta-
prism [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire MABP domain.
