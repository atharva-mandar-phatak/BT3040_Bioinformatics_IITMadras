* SecA family signature and profile *
*************************************

SecA  is  a  cytoplasmic  protein  of  800  to  960  amino  acid residues. The
eubacterial  secA  protein  [1]  plays an important role in protein export. It
interacts  with  the  secY  and  secE  components of the protein translocation
system.  It  has  a  central  role  in  coupling  the hydrolysis of ATP to the
transfer of proteins across the membrane.

SecA  is  a  superfamily  2  (SF2)  helicase (see <PDOC51192>) that adapted to
translocate  proteins.  It  contains  the characteristic DEAD/DEXH ATPase core
structure with the seven SF2 motifs [2,3].

Several structural analyses on secA have been reported (see <PDB:1M6N>) [4,5].
They  show  that  secA  contains  two recA-like domains similar to SF1 and SF2
helicases.  In  helicases,  the  two  recA-like  domains  move relative to one
another  during the ATPase cycle, generating domain movements that translocate
the  helicase  along nucleic acids. In secA, it seems that a similar mechanism
is  used  to  generate  domain  movements  that  are  coupled  to  polypeptide
translocation.  The  N-terminal recA-like domain of secA contains an insert of
about  150 residues that forms the preprotein crosslinking domain (PPXD) which
has  the  ability  to  bind preproteins in solution and which is important for
preprotein loading onto SecYEG-containing membranes [6].

Homologs of secA are also encoded in the chloroplast  genome of some algae [7]
as well  as  in  the nuclear genome of plants [8]. It could be involved in the
intraorganellar protein transport into thylakoids.

We  have  developed  a  signature  pattern for secA proteins based on the best
conserved  region.  This region is located in the C-terminal recA-like domain.
We  also  developed  a  profile  that  covers  the region corresponding to the
two recA-like domains.
