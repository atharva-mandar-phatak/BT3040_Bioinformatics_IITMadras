* ELK domain profile *
**********************

Homeobox genes,  which encode homeodomain (HD) (see <PDOC00027>) transcription
factors, are  known to be key regulators of both plant and animal development.
In plants  homeobox genes are divided into several groups by sequences, one of
which is the KNOX (for knotted1-type homeobox) family. Proteins of this family
share other  conserved  domains,  the  KNOX  domain  and  ELK domain, which is
immediately upstream  of  the HD. The ELK domain spans ~21 amino acids and was
dubbed for  a  highly  conserved  series  of Glu, Leu, and Lys amino acids. It
could function  as  a  nuclear  localization  signal.  The  ELK domain also is
considered to  act  as  a  protein-protein interaction domain, but the precise
role of this domain has not been determined [1-4].

The ELK  domain contains repeating hydrophobic residues and has been predicted
to form an amphipathic helix [1].

Some proteins known to contain an ELK domain are listed below:

 - Maize homeotic protein knotted-1 (KN-1).
 - Maize homeobox protein rough sheath 1 (RS1).
 - Apple homeobox protein knotted-1-like 1 and 2 (KNAP1 and KNAP2).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox protein SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM).
 - Tobacco KNOTTED1-type homeodomain proteins NTH1, NTH15 and NTH23.
 - Rice KNOX family class 2 homeodomain proteins HOS58, HOS59 and HOS66.

The profile we developed covers the entire ELK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
