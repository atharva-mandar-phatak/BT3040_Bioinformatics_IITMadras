* Filamin/ABP280 repeat profile *
*********************************

The many  different  actin cross-linking proteins share a common architecture,
consisting of  a  globular  actin-binding  domain and an extended rod. Whereas
their actin-binding   domains   consist   of  two  calponin  homology  domains
(see <PDOC50021>), their rods fall into three families.

The rod  domain  of  the  family  including  the Dictyostelium gelation factor
(ABP120) and  human  filamin  (ABP280) is constructed from tandem repeats of a
100-residue motif  that is glycine and proline rich [1]. The gelation factor's
rod contains  6  copies  of  the repeat, whereas filamin has a rod constructed
from 24  repeats.  The  resolution of the 3D structure of rod repeats from the
gelation factor  has shown that they consist of a beta-sandwich, formed by two
beta-sheets arranged  in  an immunoglobulin-like fold [2,3]. Because conserved
residues that  form  the  core  of  the  repeats are preserved in filamin, the
repeat structure   should   be   common   to   the  members  of  the  gelation
factor/filamin family.

The head to tail homodimerisation is crucial to the function of the ABP120 and
ABP280 proteins.  This  interaction involves a small portion at the distal end
of the  rod  domains.  For  the  gelation  factor  it  has been shown that the
carboxy-terminal repeat 6 dimerises through a double edge-to-edge extension of
the beta-sheet  and  that  repeat 5 contributes to dimerisation to some extent
[3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire filamin/ABP280 repeat.
