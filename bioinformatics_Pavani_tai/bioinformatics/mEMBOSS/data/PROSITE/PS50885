* HAMP domain profile *
***********************

The HAMP  linker domain (domain present in Histidine kinases, Adenyl cyclases,
Methyl-accepting proteins  and Phosphatases) is an approximately 50-amino acid
alpha-helical region  common  to  chemoreceptors and histidine kinases that is
present in  several  multidomain sensor proteins that participate in a variety
of signal transduction processes. One or several copies of the HAMP domain can
be found in association with other domains such as the histidine kinase domain
(see <PDOC50109>),  the  bacterial  chemotaxis  sensory transducer domain (see
<PDOC00465>), the   PAS   repeat   (see  <PDOC50112>),  the  EAL  domain  (see
<PDOC50883>), the  GGDEF domain (see <PDOC50887>), the protein phosphatase 2C-
like domain,  the  guanylate cyclase domain (see <PDOC00425>), or the response
regulatory domain  (see  <PDOC50110>).  It  has  been  suggested that the HAMP
domain possesses  a  role  of regulating the phosphorylation or methylation of
homodimeric receptors   by   transmitting   the   conformational   changes  in
periplasmic ligand-binding   domains  to  cytoplasmic  signalling  kinase  and
methyl-acceptor domains [1].

Some proteins known to contain a HAMP domain are listed below:

 - Anabaena  cylindrica  adenylate  cyclase.  It  may  function as a membrane-
   localized receptor protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  osmolarity  sensor  protein  envZ.  It  functions  as  a
   membrane-associated protein  kinase that phosphorylates ompR in response to
   environmental signals.
 - Escherichia   coli   sensor   protein  barA.  It  could  activate  ompR  by
   phosphorylation.
 - Escherichia coli nitrate/nitrite sensor protein narX. It probably activates
   narL and narP by phosphorylation in the presence of nitrate.
 - Escherichia coli sensor protein cpxA.
 - Escherichia coli methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein I.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfiN.
 - Escherichia coli protein yhjK.
 - Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 probable chemoreceptor Y4FA.
 - Salmonella typhimurium methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein II.
 - Chlamydia trachomatis sigma regulatory family protein-PP2C phosphatase.
 - Treponema pallidum hypothetical protein TP0854.
 - Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 pleD.
 - Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein sll1365.
 - Archaeoglobus fulgidus putative signal-transducing histidine kinase.
 - Archaeoglobus fulgidus hypothetical protein AF1503.
 - Halobacterium salinarium halobacterial transducer protein IV.

 - Yeast osmolarity two-component system protein SLN1.
 - Candida albicans protein NIK1.

The profile we developed covers the entire HAMP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
