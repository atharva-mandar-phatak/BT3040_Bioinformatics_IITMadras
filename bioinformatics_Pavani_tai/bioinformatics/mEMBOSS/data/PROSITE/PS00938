* Initiation factor 3 signature *
*********************************

Initiation factor  3  (IF-3)  (gene  infC)  [1]  is  one  of the three factors
required for  the  initiation  of  protein  biosynthesis in bacteria.  IF-3 is
thought to function as  a  fidelity  factor during the assembly of the ternary
initiation complex  which  consist of the 30S ribosomal subunit, the initiator
tRNA and  the  messenger RNA. IF-3 binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit; it is a
basic protein of 141 to 212 residues.

The chloroplast  initiation factor  IF-3(chl)  is  a protein that enhances the
poly(A,U,G)-dependent binding  of  the initiator tRNA to chloroplast ribosomal
30s subunits. In its mature form it  is a protein of  about 400 residues whose
central section is evolutionary related to the sequence of bacterial IF-3 [2].

As a  signature  pattern  we selected a highly conserved region located in the
central section of bacterial IF-3 and of IF-3(chl).
