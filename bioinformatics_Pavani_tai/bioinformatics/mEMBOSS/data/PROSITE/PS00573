* Pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases class-II active site *
***********************************************************************

The pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases are FAD flavoproteins which
contains a pair of redox-active cysteines involved in the transfer of reducing
equivalents from the FAD cofactor to the substrate.   On the basis of sequence
and  structural similarities [1]  these enzymes  can  be  classified  into two
categories. The second category groups together the following enzymes:

 - Bacterial and fungal thioredoxin reductase (EC 1.8.1.9) (gene trxB) [2].
 - Salmonella typhimurium  alkyl  hydroperoxide  reductase  protein F52a (gene
   aphF) [3], an enzyme that serves to protect  the cell against damage to DNA
   by alkyl hydroperoxides.
 - NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3) from Bacillus strain YN-1 (gene ndh) [4].
 - A probable oxidoreductase which is encoded  in the Clostridium pasteurianum
   rubredoxin operon [5].
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR106w.

The sequence around the  two cysteines involved  in the redox-active disulfide
bond is conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-D-[GAS]-x(2,4)-[FYA]-x(4)-[LIVMAT]-x(0,1)-
                    [LIVM](2)-[GI]-[GDS]-[GRD]-[DN]
                    [The two C's form the active site disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
