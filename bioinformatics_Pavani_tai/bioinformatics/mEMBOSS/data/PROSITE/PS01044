* Squalene and phytoene synthases signatures *
**********************************************

Two different polyisoprene synthases have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number
of regions of sequence similarities:

 - Squalene synthase (EC 2.5.1.21)  (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase)
   (SQS), which   catalyzes  the  conversion  of  two  molecules  of  farnesyl
   diphosphate (FPP)  into  squalene.  It  is  the first committed step in the
   cholesterol biosynthetic  pathway.  The  reaction  carried  out  by  SQS is
   catalyzed in  two  separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation
   of the   two  molecules  of  FPP  to  form  presqualene  diphosphate;  this
   intermediate is  then  rearranged  in  a  NADP-dependent reduction, to form
   squalene. SQS  is  found  in eukaryotes. In yeast is is encoded by the ERG9
   gene, in mammals by the FDFT1 gene. SQS seems to be membrane-bound.
 - Phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.-) (PSY), which catalyzes the conversion of two
   molecules of  geranylgeranyl  diphosphate  (GGPP)  into phytoene. It is the
   second step   in   the   biosynthesis   of   carotenoids  from  isopentenyl
   diphosphate.  The reaction  carried out by PSY is catalyzed in two separate
   steps: the  first  is  a  head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of
   GGPP to form prephytoene diphosphate; this  intermediate is then rearranged
   to form   phytoene.   PSY   is  found  in  all  organisms  that  synthesize
   carotenoids: plants  and  photosynthetic  bacteria  as  well  as  some non-
   photosynthetic bacteria and fungi.  In  bacteria PSY is encoded by the gene
   crtB. In plants PSY is localized in the chloroplast.

As it can be seen from the description above,  both SQS and PSY share a number
of functional  similarities  which  are  also  reflected at the level of their
primary structure.  In  particular  three well conserved regions are shared by
SQS and PSY; they could be  involved in substrate binding and/or the catalytic
mechanism.  We developed signature patterns for the second and third conserved
regions; they are localized in the central part of these enzymes.
