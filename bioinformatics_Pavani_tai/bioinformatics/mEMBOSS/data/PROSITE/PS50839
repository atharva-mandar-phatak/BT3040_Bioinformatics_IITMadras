* CHASE domain profile *
************************

The CHASE  domain  is an extracellular domain of 200-230 amino acids, which is
found in  transmembrane  receptors from bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants.
It has   been  named  CHASE  (Cyclases/Histidine  kinases  Associated  Sensory
Extracellular) because  of its presence in diverse receptor-like proteins with
histidine  kinase  and  nucleotide  cyclase  domains. The  CHASE domain always
occurs N-terminally in extracellular or periplasmic locations, followed by  an
intracellular tail   housing  diverse  enzymatic  signaling  domains  such  as
histidine kinase  (see  <PDOC50109>),  adenyl  cyclase,  GGDEF-type nucleotide
cyclase  and  EAL-type  phosphodiesterase  domains, as  well  as non-enzymatic
domains such   PAS  (see  <PDOC50112>),  GAF,  phosphohistidine  and  response
regulatory  domains  (see <PDOC50110>).  The CHASE domain is predicted to bind
diverse  low  molecular  weight  ligands,  such as  the cytokinin-like adenine
derivatives  or  peptides, and   mediate   signal   transduction  through  the
respective receptors [1,2].

The CHASE  domain  has  a  predicted  alpha+beta fold, with two extended alpha
helices on  both  boundaries  and  two central alpha helices separated by beta
sheets. The  termini  are less conserved compared with the central part of the
domain, which shows strongly conserved motifs [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a CHASE domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin receptor (Cre1), which transduces the signal
   for cell  division  and  differentiation  downstream  of  cytokinins (plant
   hormones).
 - Dictyostelium discoideum spore differentiation factor receptor dhkA.
 - Dictyostelium discoideum receptor-adenylyl cyclase ACG.
 - Leishmania major hypothetical protein L4768.01.
 - Synechocystis sp. PCC 7603 hypothetical protein sll0267.

The profile we developed covers the entire CHASE domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
