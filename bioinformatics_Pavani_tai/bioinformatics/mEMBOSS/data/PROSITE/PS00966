**********************************************

Phosphomannose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8) (PMI) [1,2] is the enzyme that catalyzes
the interconversion   of   mannose-6-phosphate  and  fructose-6-phosphate.  In
eukaryotes, it is  involved  in  the  synthesis  of     GDP-mannose which is a
constituent of N- and O-linked glycans as well as GPI anchors. In prokaryotes,
it is  involved  in  a  variety  of pathways including capsular polysaccharide
biosynthesis and D-mannose metabolism.

Three classes  of  PMI have been defined on the basis of sequence similarities
[1]. The first  class comprises all known eukaryotic PMI as well as the enzyme
encoded by  the  manA gene in enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. Class I
PMI's are  proteins  of about  42 to 50 Kd which bind a zinc ion essential for
their activity.

As signature patterns  for class I PMI, we selected two conserved regions. The
first one  is  located in the N-terminal section of these proteins, the second
in the  C-terminal  half.  Both patterns contain a residue involved [3] in the
binding of the zinc ion.
