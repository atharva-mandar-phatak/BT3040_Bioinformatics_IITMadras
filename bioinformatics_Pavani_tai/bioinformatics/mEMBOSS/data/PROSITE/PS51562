* mRNA cap 0 methyltransferase domain profile *
***********************************************

Most  mRNAs  undergo a chemical modification called capping resulting in a cap
at  the  5' end of the newly transcribed mRNA. The 5' cap 0 structure consists
of  a  guanine  nucleotide  methylated  at  position 7 connected to the mRNA's
initiating  nucleoside  via  an  inverted  5'-5'  triphosphate  linkage. After
formation  of  the  5'  cap  0,  the  mRNA's first base usually goes through a
methylation  on  the  2'-O  position  of  its ribose resulting in the 5' cap 1
structure.  Further methylations can occur on the first and second nucleotides
leading to the 5' cap 2 structure [1,2,3].

The  5'  cap  structure  is  essential  as  it  protects  mRNA  by  preventing
degradation by 5' exoribonucleases and it also promotes translation [1,2,3].

Before capping, the precursor (pre-) mRNA has three phosphate groups linked to
the 5'carbon of its first nucleoside. Capping (here: formation of the 5' cap 0
structure only) calls for three consecutive reactions on the nascent pre-mRNA:
1.  Removal  by  hydrolysis  of  the  pre-mRNA's  gamma-phosphate  by  RNA  5'
triphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.33) [E1].
2.   Addition   of   GMP   from   GTP   to  the  5'  diphosphate  RNA  by  RNA
guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.50) [E2].
3.   Methylation   of   the  5'  GpppN  by  a  cap-specific  RNA  (guanine-N7)
methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.56)  [E3].  The enzyme uses S-adenosylmethionine
(AdoMet  or  SAM)  as  the  methyl  donor  and  leads  to the formation of the
m7GpppRNA structure (the 5' cap) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) [1,2,3].

As  the  capping  apparatus,  formed  by the protein(s) carrying out the three
capping  reactions, is specifically targeted to RNA polymerase II transcripts,
capping concerns most eukaryotic cellular and viral eukaryotic mRNAs. Although
the  capping  apparatus  is  functionally  conserved in eukaryotes, it differs
between  organisms  regarding  subunit  organization.  In  yeast, there is one
enzyme  per  each  catalytic  activity  while  in  metazoans  and  plants  the
triphosphatase  and  the  guanylyltransferase are encoded by a single gene. In
all eukaryotic organisms, the methyltransferase is encoded by a gene that only
encodes this activity [1,2,3].

The  3D  structure  of  the cap methyltransferase Ecm1 from the microsporidian
parasite  Encephalitozoon cuniculi has been determined bound to AdoMet, AdoHcy
and  the  cap  guanilate  methyl  acceptor  (see  <PDB:1RI1>).  It  is a small
monomeric  enzyme  that  contains  virtually  nothing  more than the catalytic
domain.  The  protein  contains  9  alpha  helices  and  11  beta  strands and
altogether  displays a rossmanoidal fold characteristic of Class I SAM-binding
methyltransferases (see <PDOC51555>).
It   also   exhibits   structural   features   that   appear  unique  to  mRNA
(guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferases   (mRNA-Cap0-MTs   hereafter)   such  as  a
N-terminal  region  comprising about 40 amino acids that are disordered in the
crystals,  among  which  amino  acids  30  to  40,  not visible in the crystal
structure, happen to be essential for Ecm1 activity [1].
The  structure  of Ecm1 can be divided up into two segments in-between which a
large  cleft  with  two  ligand  binding  pockets results. This cleft contains
solvent  exposed amino acids that are conserved among other mRNA-Cap0-MTs. The
second  segment  contains the elements associated with AdoMet binding in other
Class  I  MTs  and  when AdoMet is bound to Ecm1, this segments forms a pocket
that  AdoMet  expectedly  occupies.  When  co-crystallized  with Ecm1, the cap
analog  m7GpppG  is  bound  in  a  pocket  adjacent to the one binding AdoMet.
Catalysis  seems  not  to  be  operated through direct involvement of specific
amino  acid  side chains, since no residue is observed to be in direct contact
with  the  guanosine-N7  nucleophile, nor the the AdoMet methyl carbon nor the
AdoHcy  sulfur leaving group. Instead, Ecm1 manifestly ease methyl transfer to
the  cap  guanine-N7  by  coordinating the different players in an environment
that optimizes substrate proximity and orientation [1].

Several  eukaryotic  DNA  and  RNA  viruses  encode  some  or  all the capping
enzymatic  activities,  often  on  a single polypeptide. As such, the vaccinia
virus,  a  poxvirus  used  in  vaccination  against  smallpox, encodes for two
polypeptides  responsible  for  mRNA  capping:  D1  and  D12.  D1  contains an
N-terminal    domain    responsible    for    the   triphosphatase   and   the
guanylyltransferase   activities   and  a  C-terminal  region  containing  the
mRNA-Cap0-MT  domain.  In  order for the mRNA-Cap0-MT domain of D1 to be fully
active, D1 needs to associate with D12, a stimulatory subunit [2].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  mRNA-Cap0-MT domain of the vaccinia virus D1
bound  to  AdoHcy  in  complex  with its stimulatory D12 subunit has also been
described (see <PDB:2VDW>). All in all, the vaccinia mRNA-Cap0-MT domain shows
a  conformation  that  is  quite  similar  to  the one of Ecm1, except for one
difference:  the  N-terminal  extension of the vaccinia domain folds back over
the  AdoHcy  binding  site,  burying  the  ligand;  this N-terminal section is
involved catalytically as several amino acids in it bind AdoHcy [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire mRNA-Cap0-MT domain.
