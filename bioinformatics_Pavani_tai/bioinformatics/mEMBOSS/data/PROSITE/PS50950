* Zinc finger THAP-type profile *
*********************************

The  THAP-type  zinc  finger  (consensus:  C-x(2,4)-C-x(35,50)-C-x(2)-H) is an
~90-residue  domain  restricted  to  animals, which is shared between the THAP
family  of cellular DNA-binding proteins, and transposases from mobile genomic
parasites   [1,2].   THAP1,  the  prototype  of  the  THAP  family,  possesses
zinc-dependent   sequence-specific  DNA  binding  activity  and  recognizes  a
consensus DNA target sequence of 11 nucleotides [3]. The THAP-type zinc finger
can  be  found in one or more copies and can be associated with other domains,
such as the C2H2-type zinc finger (see <PDOC00028>).

The  structure  of  the  THAP-type  zinc  finger  (see <PDB:2JTG>) reveals the
presence  between  the C2CH zinc coordinating residues of a short antiparallel
beta-sheet   interspersed   by   a   long   loop-helix-loop   insertion.  This
loop-helix-loop motif has been shown to be essential for the identification of
a number of critical residues for DNA recognition [4].

Some proteins known to contain a THAP-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Thanatos-associated protein-1 (THAP1). It potentiates both serum
   withdrawal- and   tumor   necrosis   factor  alpha-induced  apoptosis,  and
   interacts with  prostate-apoptosis-response  4 (Par4), a well-characterized
   proapoptotic factor.
 - Mammalian  death-associated  protein  DAP4/p52rIPK  or  THAP0.  It has been
   identified in  a  genetic  screen  for  genes involved in interferon-gamma-
   induced apoptosis  in  HeLa  cells  and in a two-hybrid screen for indirect
   activators of  the  interferon-induced kinase PKR, an important mediator of
   stress-induced apoptosis.
 - Mammalian THAP2 to THAP11.
 - Drosophila melanogaster dorsal interacting protein 2 (DIP2).
 - Drosophila melanogaster P element transposase.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the  whole  THAP-type  zinc finger with 4
positions upstream, and about 20 positions downstream.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
