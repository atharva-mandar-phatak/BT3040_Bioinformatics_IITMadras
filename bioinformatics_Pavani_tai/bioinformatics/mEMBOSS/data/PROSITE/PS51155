* Chitin-binding type R&R domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

Insect cuticle is composed of proteins and chitin. The cuticular proteins seem
to be specific to the type of cuticle (flexible or stiff) that occur at stages
of the insect development. The proteins found in the flexible cuticle of larva
and pupa of different insects share a conserved C-terminal section [1]; such a
region is  also found in the soft endocuticle of adults insects [2] as well as
in other  cuticular  proteins including in arachnids [3]. This conserved motif
of 35-36  amino  acids  is  known  as  the  R&R  consensus  since it was first
recognized by Rebers and Riddiford. N-terminal to the consensus is a region of
hydrophilic amino  acids.  The  two  regions  together  have  been  called the
extended R&R  consensus and form an about 70 amino acids chitin-binding domain
[4,5].

The R&R  chitin-binding  domain  has  been proposed to constitute antiparallel
beta-pleaated sheets [6].

Some proteins known to contain a R&R chitin-binding domain are listed below:

 - Locust  cuticle  proteins  7  (LM-7),  8 (LM-8), 19 (LM-19) and endocuticle
   structural glycoprotein ABD-4.
 - Hyalophora cecropia cuticle proteins 12 and 66.
 - Drosophila larval cuticles proteins I, II, III and IV (LCP1 to LCP4).
 - Drosophila pupal cuticle protein (PCP).
 - Drosophila pupal cuticle proteins EDG-78E and EDG-84E.
 - Manduca sexta cuticle protein LCP-14.
 - Tenebrio molitor cuticle proteins ACP-20, A1A, A2B and A3A.
 - Araneus  diadematus (spider) cuticle proteins ACP 11.9, ACP 12.4, ACP 12.6,
   ACP 15.5 and ACP 15.7.

We have  developed  both  a  pattern  and a profile for the R&R chitin-binding
domain. The  pattern  covers the R&R consensus, whereas the profile covers the
entire R&R chitin-binding domain.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(7)-[DEN]-G-x(6)-[FY]-x-A-[DNG]-x(2,3)-G-[FY]-x-[APV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
