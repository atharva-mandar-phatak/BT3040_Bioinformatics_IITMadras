* Albumin domain signature and profile *
****************************************

The following  serum  transport  proteins are known to be evolutionary related
[1,2,3]:

 - Albumin  (ALB), the main protein of plasma. It binds water, cations such as
   Ca++, Na+,  K+,  fatty  acids,  hormones,  bilirubin  and  drugs.  Its main
   function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.
 - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (alpha-fetoglobulin). AFP is a fetal plasma protein
   which also binds various cations, fatty acids and bilirubin.
 - Vitamin D-binding protein (VDB), also known  as group-specific component or
   Gc-globulin. VDB binds to  vitamin D and  its metabolites as  well as fatty
   acids.
 - Afamin (or alpha-albumin),  a  protein  whose  biochemical  role is not yet
   characterized.

Structurally, these  proteins  consist  of  two to seven homologous domains of
about 190  amino acids. Each domain, consisting of 10 alpha-helices, is formed
by two smaller subdomains and contains five or six internal disulfide bonds as
shown in the following schematic representation [4].

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

The signature  pattern we derived is based on three conserved cysteines at the
end of  the domain. We built it in such a way that it can detect all 3 repeats
in albumin and human afamin, the first two in AFP and the first one in VDB and
rat afamin.  We  also  developed  a  profile,  which covers the entire albumin
domain.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-x(6)-C-C-x(2)-{C}-x(4)-C-[LFY]-x(6)-[LIVMFYW]
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: mammalian CD63 antigen.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: March 2009 / Text revised; profile added.
