* Terpene synthases signature *
*******************************

The following enzymes catalyze mechanistically related reactions which involve
the highly complex cyclic rearrangement of squalene or its 2,3 oxide:

 - Lanosterol  synthase  (EC 5.4.99.7)  (oxidosqualene--lanosterol   cyclase),
   which catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to lanosterol, the
   initial precursor  of  cholesterol,  steroid  hormones  and  vitamin  D  in
   vertebrates and of ergosterol in fungi (gene ERG7).
 - Cycloartenol   synthase    (EC 5.4.99.8)   (2,3-epoxysqualene--cycloartenol
   cyclase), a  plant  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  cyclization  of  (S)-2,3-
   epoxysqualene to cycloartenol.
 - Hopene  synthase  (EC  5.4.99.17) (squalene--hopene  cyclase),  a bacterial
   enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization  of squalene into hopene, a  key step
   in hopanoid (triterpenoid) metabolism.

These enzymes are evolutionary related [1] proteins of about 70 to 85 Kd. As a
signature pattern,  we  selected  a  highly  conserved region which is rich in
aromatic residues and which is located in the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [DE]-G-S-W-x-[GE]-x-W-[GA]-[LIVM]-x-[FY]-x-Y-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
