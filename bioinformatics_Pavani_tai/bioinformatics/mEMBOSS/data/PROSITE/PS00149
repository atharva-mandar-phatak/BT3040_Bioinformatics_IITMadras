* Sulfatases signatures *
*************************

Sulfatases (EC 3.1.6.-) are enzymes that hydrolyze various sulfate esters. The
sequence of different types of sulfatases are available. These enzymes are:

 - Arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.8)  (ASA), a lysosomal  enzyme  which  hydrolyzes
   cerebroside sulfate.
 - Arylsulfatase B (EC 3.1.6.12) (ASB),  a  lysosomal enzyme  which hydrolyzes
   the sulfate ester group from  N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate  residues  of
   dermatan sulfate.
 - Arylsulfatase C (ASD).
 - Arylsulfatase E (ASE).
 - Steryl-sulfatase  (EC 3.1.6.2) (STS)  (arylsulfatase C),  a  membrane bound
   microsomal enzyme which hydrolyzes 3-beta-hydroxy steroid sulfates.
 - Iduronate 2-sulfatase precursor (EC 3.1.6.13)  (IDS),  a  lysosomal  enzyme
   that hydrolyzes the 2-sulfate  groups  from  non-reducing-terminal iduronic
   acid residues in dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.
 - N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase  (EC 3.1.6.4),  an enzyme that hydrolyzes
   the 6-sulfate  groups  of  the  N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 6-sulfate units of
   chondroitin sulfate and the D-galactose 6-sulfate units of keratan sulfate.
 - Choline  sulfatase  (EC  3.1.6.6)  (gene  betC),  a  bacterial  enzyme that
   converts choline-O-sulfate to choline.
 - Glucosamine-6-sulfatase   (EC 3.1.6.14)  (G6S),  a  lysosomal  enzyme  that
   hydrolyzes the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  6-sulfate  units  of heparan sulfate
   and keratan sulfate.
 - N-sulphoglucosamine   sulphohydrolase  (EC  3.10.1.1)  (sulphamidase),  the
   lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-sulfo-d-glucosamine into
   glucosamine and sulfate.

 - Sea urchin embryo arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1).
 - Green  alga  arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1), an enzyme which plays an important
   role in the mineralization of sulfates.
 - Arylsulfatase  (EC  3.1.6.1)  from Escherichia coli (gene aslA), Klebsiella
   aerogenes (gene atsA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gene atsA).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidJ.

It has been shown that all these sulfatases are structurally related [1,2,3].

As signature patterns for that family of enzymes we have selected the two best
conserved regions. Both regions are located in the N-terminal section of these
enzymes.   The  first  region  contains  a conserved arginine which  could  be
implicated in  the  catalytic  mechanism;  it is located four residues after a
position that,  in  eukaryotic  sulfatases,  is a conserved cysteine which has
been shown  [4] to be modified to 2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid. In prokaryotes,
this cysteine is replaced by a serine.

-Consensus pattern: [SAPG]-[LIVMST]-[CS]-[STACG]-P-[STA]-R-x(2)-[LIVMFW](2)-
                    [TAR]-G
                    [R is a putative active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: G-[YV]-x-[ST]-x(2)-[IVAS]-G-K-x(0,1)-[FYWMK]-[HL]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
