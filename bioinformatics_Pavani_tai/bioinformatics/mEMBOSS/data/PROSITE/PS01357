* Zinc finger ZZ-type signature and profile *
*********************************************

The  putative  ZZ  zinc finger, was first identified in the Dystrophin gene, a
427 kDa protein, involved in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This motif
is  also  present  in  the  adaptor proteins CBP and P300 in a region known to
interact  with  YY1,  E1A  and TFIIB, which suggest a possible protein binding
function  for this domain [1]. It is closely related to the B-box zinc finger,
(see <PDOC50119>)  however  B-box  do  not contain  the Asp-Tyr-Asp-Leu  motif
present in most of the ZZ zinc fingers [2].

Some of the proteins containing this domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian CBP  and  the  related  protein p300. Large nuclear proteins that
   interact with transcriptional activators and repressors.
 - Mammalian  dystrophin,    a   multidomain cytoskeletal protein. Its longest
   alternatively spliced  form consists of an N-terminal actin-binding domain,
   followed by  24  spectrin-like  repeats,  a  cysteine-rich  calcium-binding
   domain  and a C-terminal  globular domain. Dystrophin form tetramers and is
   thought to  have  multiple  functions  including  involvement  in  membrane
   stability, transduction   of   contractile   forces  to  the  extracellular
   environment and  organization of membrane specialization. Mutations in  the
   dystrophin gene lead to muscular dystrophy of Duchenne or Becker type.
 - Human   dystrophin  related  protein  2.  Possibly  involved  in  membrane-
   cytosqueleton interactions in the central nervous system.
 - Utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein of unknown function.
 - Drosophila  Ref(2)P protein. Implicated in sigma rhabdovirus multiplication
   and necessary for male fertility.
 - Prt1  of Arabidopsis  thaliana. Encodes a component of the plant N-end rule
   pathway [3].

The  ZZ  zinc  finger  contains  7 positions able to coordinate one zinc atom,
among them  only  4  are completely conserved. Our pattern is based on these 4
positions. We have also developed a profile that spans the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x(4,8)-[RHDGSCV]-[YWFMVIL]-x-[CS]-x(2,5)-[CHEQ]-
                    x-[DNSAGE]-[YFVLI]-x-[LIVFM]-C-x(2)-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
