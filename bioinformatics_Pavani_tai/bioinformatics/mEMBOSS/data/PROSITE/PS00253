* Interleukin-1 signature *
***************************

Interleukin-1 (IL-1)  [1,2,3]  is  a  member of a family of cellular mediators
known as   cytokines.   IL-1  has  many  biological  activities.  Among  other
functions, it  is  a  fever-producing  factor (pyrogen), induces prostaglandin
synthesis, is involved in T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as
in B-lymphocyte activation and proliferation via interleukin-2.

There are  two    different   forms  of IL-1: IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta,  whose
sequence are  about  25%  identical.    IL-1  alpha  and beta bind to the same
receptor. Both  forms  of  IL-1 are synthesized as precursor proteins of about
270 residues  which are then post-translationally processed by the cleavage of
a N-terminal sequence of approximately 115 residues.

The interleukin-1  receptor  antagonist  (IL-1ra)  is  a  protein structurally
related to IL-1's but whose biological function is not yet known.

As a signature pattern for  these cytokines, we selected a conserved region in
the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [FC]-x-S-[ASLV]-x(2)-P-x(2)-[FYLIV]-[LI]-[SCA]-T-x(7)-
                    [LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Text revised.
