* Laminin G domain profile *
****************************

The   Laminin   G   or   LNS  domain  (for  Laminin-alpha,  Neurexin  and  Sex
hormone-binding  globulin)  is an around 180 amino acid long domain found in a
large  and  diverse  set  of extracellular proteins [1,2]. It often occures in
multiple  copies  probably serving as general protein interaction domains that
bind  the  target proteins and other macromolecules, such as carbohydrates. In
most  proteins,  the  precise  function  of the laminin G domain is unknown. A
large  number  of  ligands  in  the  G  domain  of  laminin has been reported,
including  heparin,  sulfatides, integrins, dystroglycan, nidogen, and fibulin
[3,4,5].   In   neurexin  the  G  domain  is  known  to  bind  neurexophilins,
alpha-latrotoxin and neuroligins.

The  crystal  structure of Laminin G domain of neurexin 1-beta has been solved
[6].  It  is  composed  of 14 beta strands and one alpha helix. The 14 strands
form  two  antiparallel  seven  stranded beta sheets in a jelly roll fold. The
alpha  helix  is  located  between beta strand 12 and 13. The structure of the
laminin  G  domain  is  similar to the lectin domain. Alignment of various LNS
with  neurexin  1-beta reveal that only the central part (between strand 4 and
13) is conserved.

Some proteins known to contain a laminin G domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic laminin alpha chains. It is a major noncollagenous components of
   basement membranes  that  mediate  cell  adhesion,  growth  migration,  and
   differentiation.
 - Mammalian neurexins.
 - Sex  steroid binding protein  SBP/SHBG. It regulates  the  plasma metabolic
   clearance rate   of   steroid   hormones   by   controlling   their  plasma
   concentration.
 - Agrin,  a basal lamina protein.  It causes the aggregation of acetylcholine
   receptors on cultured muscle fibers.
 - Vitamin K dependent protein S. An anticoagulant plasma protein that acts as
   a cofactor to activated protein C in the degradation of coagulation factors
   VA and VIIIA. It helps to prevent coagulation and stimulating fibrinolysis.
 - Drosophila  slit  protein,  essential  for  development of midline glia and
   commissural axon  pathways.  It  is  composed of four leucine-rich repeats,
   seven EGF-like domains, a laminin G-like repeat and the CTCK.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the  whole  domain,  including the highly
divergent ends. We artificially placed the threshold at 12.1 to remove matches
against   thrombospondin-like   N-terminal  domain,  a  structurally homologue
module. Thus  we  also  remove few real matches which have a score between 8.5
and 12.1.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
