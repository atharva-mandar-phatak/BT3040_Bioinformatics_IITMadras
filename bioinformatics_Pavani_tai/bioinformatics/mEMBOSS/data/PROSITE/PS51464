* SIS domain profile *
**********************

The  sugar  isomerase  (SIS)  domain  is a phosphosugar-binding module that is
found  in  a  variety  of eubacterial, archaebacterial and eukaryotic proteins
that  have a role in phosphosugar isomerization or regulation [1]. In enzymes,
the  SIS  domain  can  have  a  catalytic function as an isomerase and bind to
phosphorylated  sugars.  In  bacterial  transcriptional regulators of the rpiR
family,  the domain seems to bind substrates implicated in the genes for sugar
metabolism  that  are  controlled by the regulator. The SIS domain is found in
one  or  two  copies  and  can  be  linked  to  additional  domains,  such  as
helix-turn-helix  (HTH)  (see  <PDOC51071>),  CBS (see <PDOC51371>), glutamine
amidotransferases  type  2 (see <PDOC00406>), or phosphopantetheine-attachment
(see <PDOC00012>) [1,2,E1].

The SIS domain has an alpha-beta structure and is dominated by a five-stranded
parallel  beta  sheet flanked on either side by alpha helices forming a three-
layer   alpha-beta-alpha   sandwich  (see  <PDB:1MOQ>)  [3].  The  fold  shows
similarities to that of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (see <PDOC00157>).

Some proteins known to contain a SIS domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic      and      prokaryotic      glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate
   aminotransferase [isomerizing] (EC 2.6.1.16).
 - Eukaryotic glucokinase regulator (GCKR) family (see <PDOC00979>).
 - Bacterial rpiR family of HTH transcriptional regulators (see <PDOC51071>).
 - Escherichia coli arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase (kdsD) (EC 5.3.1.13).
 - Escherichia coli fructoselysine 6-phosphate deglycase (frlB) (EC 3.5.-.-).
 - Escherichia  coli  gutQ,  which is encoded by the glucitol-synthesis operon
   and is thought to contain a nucleotide-binding site.
 - Escherichia coli polysialic acid capsule expression protein kpsF.
 - Bacterial phosphoheptose isomerase (gmhA/lpcA) or sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
   isomerase (EC 5.3.1.-).
 - Prokaryotic 3-hexulose-6-phosphate isomerase (PHI) (EC 5.3.1.27).
 - Enterobacterial dnaA initiator-associating protein diaA.
 - Proteobacterial    N-acetylmuramic   acid   6-phosphate   etherase   (murQ)
   (EC 4.2.-.-),   which   catalyzes   the  cleavage  of  the  D-lactyl  ether
   substituent   of  MurNAc  6-phosphate,  producing  GlcNAc  6-phosphate  and
   D-lactate.
 - Bacterial  putative  tagatose-6-phosphate  ketose/aldose  isomerase  (agaS)
   (EC 5.3.1.-).
