* NF-Y/HAP subunits signatures and profile *
********************************************

Diverse DNA binding  proteins are  known  to bind the CCAAT box, a common cis-
acting element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of a large number of
genes in  eukaryotes. Amongst these proteins is one known as the CCAAT-binding
factor (CBF)  or  NF-Y [1].  CBF  is  a heteromeric transcription  factor that
consists of two different components both needed for DNA-binding.

The HAP  protein  complex  of  yeast  binds to the upstream activation site of
cytochrome C   iso-1   gene   (CYC1)  as  well  as  other  genes  involved  in
mitochondrial electron  transport  and  activates  their  expression.  It also
recognizes the  sequence CCAAT and is structurally and evolutionary related to
CBF.

The  first  subunit of CBF, known as CBF-A or NF-YB in vertebrates and HAP3 in
budding  yeast, is a protein of 116 to 210 amino- acid residues which contains
a  highly  conserved central domain of about 90 residues. This domain displays
some  sequence  similarity  to  histones H2B (see <PDOC00308>) and seems to be
involved  in  DNA-binding;  we  have  developed  a  signature pattern from its
central part.

The  second subunit of CBF, known as CBF-B or NF-YA in vertebrates and HAP2 in
budding yeast, is a protein of 265 to 350 amino-acid residues which contains a
highly  conserved  region  of  about  60  residues.  This  region,  called the
'essential  core'  [2],  seems  to  consist  of  two subdomains: an N-terminal
subunit-association  domain  and  a C-terminal DNA recognition domain. We have
developed  a  signature  pattern  from  a  section  of the subunit-association
domain (SAD) and a profile that covers both subdomains.
