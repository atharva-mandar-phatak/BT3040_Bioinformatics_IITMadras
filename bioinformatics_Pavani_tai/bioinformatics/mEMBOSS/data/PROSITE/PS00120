* Lipases, serine active site *
*******************************

Triglyceride lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) [1]  are  lipolytic  enzymes that hydrolyzes
the ester  bond of  triglycerides.  Lipases are widely distributed in animals,
plants and prokaryotes. In higher vertebrates there are at least three tissue-
specific isozymes: pancreatic, hepatic, and gastric/lingual. These three types
of lipases are  closely related to each other as well as to lipoprotein lipase
(EC 3.1.1.34) [2], which hydrolyzes triglycerides of chylomicrons and very low
density lipoproteins (VLDL).

The most conserved region  in  all  these proteins is centered around a serine
residue  which  has  been shown [3] to participate, with an  histidine  and an
aspartic acid residue, to a charge relay system. Such a region is also present
in lipases of prokaryotic origin  and in lecithin-cholesterol  acyltransferase
(EC 2.3.1.43)  (LCAT)  [4],  which   catalyzes  fatty  acid  transfer  between
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. We have built a pattern from that region.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-{KG}-[LIVFY]-[LIVMST]-G-[HYWV]-S-{YAG}-G-[GSTAC]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 38.

-Note: Drosophila vitellogenins are also related to lipases [5], but they have
 lost their active site serine.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
