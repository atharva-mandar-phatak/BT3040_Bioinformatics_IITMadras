* LCCL domain profile *
***********************

The LCCL domain has been named after the best characterized proteins that were
found  to  contain  it,  namely  Limulus factor C, Coch-5b2 and Lgl1. It is an
about 100 amino acids domain whose C-terminal part contains a highly conserved
histidine  in  a conserved motif YxxxSxxCxAAVHxGVI. The LCCL module is thought
to  be  an autonomously folding domain that has been used for the construction
of  various  modular  proteins  through  exon-shuffling.  It has been found in
various  metazoan  proteins  in  association  with  complement B-type domains,
C-type  lectin  domains  (see <PDOC00537>), von Willebrand type A domains (see
<PDOC50234>),  CUB  domains (see <PDOC00908>), discoidin lectin domains or CAP
domains.  It  has  been  proposed  that  the  LCCL domain could be involved in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding [1,2,E1].

Secondary structure prediction suggests that the LCCL domain contains six beta
strands and two alpha helices [1].

Some proteins known to contain a LCCL domain are listed below:

 - Limulus  factor  C, a LPS endotoxin-sensitive trypsin type serine protease,
   which serves to protect the organism from bacterial infection.
 - Vertebrate  cochlear  protein  cochlin  or  coch-5b2. Cochlin is probably a
   secreted protein. Mutations affecting the LCCL domain of coch-5b2 cause the
   deafness disorder  DFNA9 in humans.
 - Mammalian  late  gestation lung protein Lgl1, contains two tandem copies of
   the LCCL domain [3].

The profile we have developed covers the entire LCCL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
