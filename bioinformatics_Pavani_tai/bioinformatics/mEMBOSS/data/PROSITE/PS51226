* TEP1 N-terminal repeat profile *
**********************************

Telomerase  protein  component  1 (TP1/TLP1) or TEP1 is a protein component of
two ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes: vaults and telomerase. Vaults are large
RNP  particles  with a barrel-like structure (see <PDOC51224>). The telomerase
RNP   replenishes  incomplete  chromosome  termini  due  to  DNA  replication.
Mammalian  TEP1  is an RNA-binding protein and is required for the association
of  vault  RNA  with  the  vault  particle  [1,2]. The N-terminal part of TEP1
contains  4  copies  of  the  TEP1  N-terminal repeat in tandem. The repeat is
composed  of  30  amino  acids  and  occurs in combination with the TROVE (see
<PDOC50988>)  and  NACHT (see <PDOC50837>) domains and with WD-40 repeats (see
<PDOC00574>) in the C-terminal part.

The profile we developed covers the entire TEP1 N-terminal repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
