* CS domain profile *
*********************

The bipartite  CS  domain, which was named after CHORD-containing proteins and
SGT1 [1],  is  a  ~100-residue  protein-protein interaction module. It is only
present in  eukaryota (alveolata, fungi, metazoa, and plant divisions). The CS
domain can  be found in stand-alone form, as well as fused with other domains,
such as  CHORD,  SGS  (see  <PDOC51048>), TPR (see <PDOC50005>), cytochrome b5
(see <PDOC00170>) or b5 reductase, in multidomain proteins [2].

The CS  domain  has  a  compact  antiparallel beta-sandwich fold consisting of
seven beta-strands (see <PDB:1EJF>) [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a CS domain are listed below [2]:

 - Eukaryotic proteins of the SGT1 family.
 - Eukaryotic  Rar1,  related  to  pathogenic  resistance  in  plants,  and to
   development in animals.
 - Eukaryotic nuclear movement protein nudC.
 - Eukaryotic proteins of the  p23/wos2 family, which act as co-chaperone.
 - Animal b5+b5R flavo-hemo cytochrome NAD(P)H oxydoreductase type B.
 - Mammalian integrin beta-1-binding protein 2 (melusin).

The profile we developed covers the entire CS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The CS domain is also known as the p23-like domain [2].
