* AXH domain profile *
**********************

The AXH  (ataxin-1  and  HMG-box  protein  1) domain is a module of ~130 amino
acids, which  has  been  identified  in  ATX1  and in the apparently unrelated
transcription factor HBP1 [1]. It is found in many vertebrate and invertebrate
proteins. It  has  been  suggested that the AXH domain is a molecular scaffold
domain engaged in multiple protein-protein interactions and in RNA binding.

The AXH  domain consists of a noncanonical oligonucleotide and oligosaccharide
binding (OB)  fold.  Although  sharing a similar OB fold, the structure of the
AXH domains  from  ATX1  (see  <PDB:1OA8>)  and  HBP1  (see  <PDB:1V06>)  have
genuinely distinct  folds.  The  differences  are  not,  as in other chameleon
sequences, determined  by  a  different  tendency  to adopt distinct secondary
structures: the  two  folds  share  the same secondary structure elements, but
these are  differently  arranged  in  space.  The  AXH  domain has a chameleon
structure in  which  the  N  and  C  termini  can  adopt  distinctly different
conformation. Neither  of  the  differences  are induced by binding to another
molecule. While clearly correlated (sharing a sequence identity of ca. 30% and
a homology  of  ca.  50% depending on the species), AXH has slightly different
domain boundaries and distinct properties in ATX1 and HBP1. There is a cluster
of charged residues that could constitute a ligand-binding site [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a AXH domain are listed below:

 - Animal   ataxin-1   (ATX1),  a  neurodegenerative  disorder  protein  whose
   glutamine-repeat expanded  form causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)
   in humans and exerts cytotoxicity in Drosophila and mouse.
 - Animal Brother of ataxin-1 (Boat) [4].
 - Vetebrate HMG box containing protein 1 (HBP1). It is thought to be involved
   in an   architectural   regulation   of  chromatin  and  in  specific  gene
   expression.

The profile we developed covers the entire AXH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
