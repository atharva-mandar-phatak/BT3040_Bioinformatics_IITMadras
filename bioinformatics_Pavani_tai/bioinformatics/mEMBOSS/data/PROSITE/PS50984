* TRUD domain profile *
***********************

The most  abundant  modification seen in structured RNAs (transfer, ribosomal,
and splicing  RNAs)  is  the isomerization of uridine (U) to pseudouridine (5-
ribosyluracil). Pseudouridine is made by a set of enzymes called pseudouridine
synthase, which  select  specific  U  residues  in  a polynucleotide chain for
isomerization to  pseudouridine.  Pseudouridine  synthases  are  ubiquitous as
putative synthase genes have been found in all genomes so far sequenced. TruD,
a pseudouridine  synthase  in Escherichia coli, is responsible for modifying U
13 in  tRNA-Glu  to  pseudouridine.  Homologs  of truD have been identified in
eubacteria, archaea,  and  eukarya. Because all of the organisms known to have
pseudouridine 13  in their tRNAs also have a truD homolog, it is reasonable to
infer that truD homologs in those organisms with tRNA pseudouridine 13 are the
responsible synthases [1].

TruD folds  into  a  V-shaped  molecule with two distinct modules: a catalytic
domain that  differs  in  sequence  but  is  structurally  very similar to the
catalytic domain  of  other  pseudouridine synthases and a TRUD domain of ~150
amino acids  with  a alpha/beta fold (see <PDB:1SI7>). The TRUD domain forms a
compact fold  that  is  titled  away  from the catalytic domain to form a deep
cleft in  truD  which  is lined with basic residues from each domain. The TRUD
domain is always associated with a truD-type catalytic domain and is not found
on its  own  or  attached  to  another  type  of protein as a separate module.
Furthermore, there are no truD-type catalytic domain that lack the TRUD domain
insert. The TRUD domain is characterized by two conserved sequence motifs that
form a  part  of  the  hydrophobic  core. The TRUD domain sequence in the truD
family is  also  characterized  by  large insertions at several specific sites
that are  seen  in  many  archaeal and eukaryotic homologs. The TRUD domain is
likely to be involved in substrate recognition and may represent a RNA binding
module [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire TRUD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
