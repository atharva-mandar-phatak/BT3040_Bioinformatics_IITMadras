* Actinin-type actin-binding domain signatures *
************************************************

Alpha-actinin is  a F-actin cross-linking  protein  which is thought to anchor
actin to a variety of intracellular structures [1].   The actin-binding domain
of alpha-actinin seems to reside in the first  250 residues of the protein.  A
similar actin-binding domain has  been  found in the N-terminal region of many
different actin-binding proteins [2,3]:

 - In the beta chain of spectrin (or fodrin).
 - In dystrophin, the protein defective  in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and which  may  play a  role  in  anchoring the  cytoskeleton to the plasma
   membrane.
 - In the slime mold gelation factor (or ABP-120).
 - In actin-binding protein ABP-280  (or filamin), a  protein  that link actin
   filaments to membrane glycoproteins.
 - In fimbrin (or plastin),  an actin-bundling protein.  Fimbrin  differs from
   the above proteins in  that  it  contains  two  tandem copies of the actin-
   binding domain and that these copies are located  in the C-terminal part of
   the protein.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns for this type of
domain.  The first of this region  is located at  the beginning of the domain,
while the second one is  located in  the central section and has been shown to
be essential for the binding of actin.
