* KIND domain profile *
***********************

The KIND   (kinase   non-catalytic   C-lobe  domain)  is  a  putative  protein
interaction domain,  which  has  been  identified  as  being similar to the C-
terminal protein  kinase  catalytic  fold  (C  lobe)  (see  <PDOC00100>).  Its
presence at  the  N-terminus  of  signalling  proteins  and the absence of the
active site  residues  in  the  catalytic and activation loops suggest that it
folds independently  and  is  likely to be non-catalytic. The occurence of the
domain only  in metazoa implies that it has evolved from the catalytic protein
kinase domain  into  an  interaction domain possibly by keeping the substrate-
binding features [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a KIND domain are listed below:

 - Animal  Spir proteins. In the central region they contain a WH2 domain (see
   <PDOC51082>) cluster,  which  is known to bind actin. The C-terminal region
   encodes a  modified  FYVE zinc-finger domain, which directs the subcellular
   localization of the proteins.
 - Animal  non-receptor phosphatase type 13 (PTP type 13), which also contains
   a FERM  domain  (see  <PDOC00566>),  PDZ  domains  (see  <PDOC50106>) and a
   tyrosine specific protein phosphatase (see <PDOC00323>).
 - Vertebrate very KIND (VKIND or KIAA1768), a signalling protein specifically
   expressed in  the nervous system of vertebrates. It has two KIND domains in
   the N-terminal  half,  and  a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain for
   Ras-like GTPases  (RasGEF)  at  the C-terminal end with a structural domain
   attached at its N-terminal (RasGEFN) (see <PDOC00594>).

The profile we developed covers the entire KIND domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
