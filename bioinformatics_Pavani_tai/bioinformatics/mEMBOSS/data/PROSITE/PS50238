* Rho GTPase-activating proteins domain profile *
*************************************************

Small  G  proteins  of  the  Rho  family,  which  includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42,
regulate phosphorylation pathways that control a range of biological functions
including  cytoskeleton formation and cell proliferation.  Rho proteins act as
molecular  switches,  with  an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound
form.  The  inactive  GDP bound form is promoted by GTPase-activating proteins
(GAPs). GAP proteins specific for Rho contain a conserved region of around 200
amino-acid  residues,  the  Rho-GAP domain. This domain can accelerate the GTP
hydrolysis activity of Rho by five orders of magnitude [1]. RhoGAP domains are
usually  associated  with  other signaling modules like SH2 (see <PDOC50001>),
SH3 (see <PDOC50002>) or PH (see <PDOC50003>).

Like  other  GAP  domains  Rho-GAP is  exclusively helical (nine helices) (see
<PDB:1RGP>)  [2].  The  core of the domain forms a four-helix bundle. The most
conserved  residues  across  the  family  are  located on the bundle face that
interacts  with  the G  protein  [3].  Rho-GAP domain like Ras-GAP supplies an
arginine  residue in trans into the active site of the G protein which confers
a self-stimulatory GAP activity through homophilic interaction [4].

Some of the proteins containing a RhoGAP domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  ARAP  1,2 and 3 proteins, a family of GTPase activating proteins
   that  contains  both  a RhoGAP and a ARFGAP domains (see <PDOC50115>). They
   can  regulate  Rho or ARF G proteins according to their localization in the
   cell.
 - Vertebrate Beta-chimaerin protein, a GTPase activating protein for the Rho-
   like GTPase Rac.
 - Mammalian  Nadrin  protein,  a  neuron-specific  GTPase-activating  protein
   involved in regulated exocytosis.
 - Mammalian unconventional myosin-9b.
 - Mammalian  breakpoint  cluster  region  protein (BCR) and Drosophila Rotund
   protein, GTPase-activating proteins for Rac and Cdc42.
 - Mammalian Rho-GAP hematopoietic protein C1.
 - Mammalian   Rho-GTPase-activating   protein   6.   It  promotes  continuous
   elongation  of  cytoplasmic processes during cell motility and simultaneous
   retraction of the cell body changing the cell morphology.
 - Mammalian   phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase  regulatory  alpha  subunit,  an
   adapter  subunit  of the phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase  (PI3K).  It  has a
   critical role in signal transduction pathways originating from a variety of
   membrane-bound receptors.
 - Mammalian  Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL-1 (EC 3.1.3.-). It may
   function  in lysosomal membrane trafficking by regulating the specific pool
   of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate that is associated with lysosomes.
 - Mammalian  type  II  inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase involved in
   signal-terminating reaction (EC 3.1.3.56.).
 - Yeast LRG1 and SAC7 proteins, the two major Rho GTPase-activating proteins.
   The SAC7 protein is involved in assembly of actin.
 - Yeast  BEM2 protein, a GTPase activating protein involved in the control of
   cellular morphogenesis.

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.
