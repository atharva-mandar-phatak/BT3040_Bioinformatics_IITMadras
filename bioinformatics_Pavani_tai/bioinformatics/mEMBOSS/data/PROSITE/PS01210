* Caveolins signature *
***********************

Caveolins [1,2]  are  a  family  of  integral  membrane proteins which are the
principal components  of  caveolae membranes. Cavoleae are flask-shaped plasma
membrane invaginations  whose  exact  cellular  function  is  not  yet  clear.
Caveolins may  act  as  scaffolding  proteins  within caveolar membranes. They
interact directly  with G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate
their activity.

Currently, three  different  forms  of  caveolins  are  known:  caveolin-1 (or
VIP21), caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 (or M-caveolin).

Caveolins are  proteins  of  about  20 Kd, they form high molecular mass homo-
oligomers. Structurally   they  seem  to  have  a  N-terminal  and  C-terminal
hydrophilic segments  and  a  long central transmembrane domains that probably
forms an  hairpin  in  the  membrane.  Both  extremities are known to face the
cytoplasm.

As a  signature  pattern, we selected a perfectly conseerved octapeptide which
is located in the N-terminal section of caveolins.

-Consensus pattern: F-E-D-[LV]-I-A-[DE]-[PA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for C.elegans caveolins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
