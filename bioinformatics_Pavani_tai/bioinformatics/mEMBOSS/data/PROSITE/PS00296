* Chaperonins cpn60 signature *
*******************************

Chaperonins [1,2] are  proteins  involved in  the  folding  of proteins or the
assembly of oligomeric protein complexes.  Their  role seems to be  to  assist
other  polypeptides to  maintain  or assume  conformations  which permit their
correct assembly into oligomeric structures.  They  are found in abundance  in
prokaryotes,  chloroplasts  and  mitochondria.   Chaperonins  form  oligomeric
complexes and  are  composed  of  two  different  types  of  subunits: a 60 Kd
protein, known  as  cpn60  (groEL  in  bacteria) and a 10 Kd protein, known as
cpn10 (groES in bacteria).

The cpn60 protein shows weak ATPase activity and is a highly conserved protein
of about 550 to 580 amino acid  residues which has been described by different
names in different species:

 - Escherichia coli groEL protein,  which  is essential for the  growth of the
   bacteria and the assembly of several bacteriophages.
 - Cyanobacterial groEL analogues.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae 65 Kd antigen, Coxiella burnetti heat
   shock protein B (gene htpB), Rickettsia tsutsugamushi major antigen 58, and
   Chlamydial 57 Kd hypersensitivity antigen  (gene hypB).
 - Chloroplast RuBisCO subunit  binding-protein  alpha  and beta chains, which
   bind ribulose  bisphosphate  carboxylase  small and large subunits  and are
   implicated in the assembly of the enzyme oligomer.
 - Mammalian mitochondrial matrix protein P1 (mitonin or P60).
 - Yeast HSP60 protein, a mitochondrial assembly factor.

As a  signature    pattern   for these proteins, we have chosen a  rather well
conserved region  of  twelve  residues, located in the last third of the cpn60
sequence.

-Consensus pattern: A-[AS]-{L}-[DEQ]-E-{A}-{Q}-{R}-x-G(2)-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 5 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.
