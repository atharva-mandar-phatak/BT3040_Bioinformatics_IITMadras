* Lipolytic enzymes "G-D-X-G" family, putative active sites signatures *
************************************************************************

The following lipolytic enzymes are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Mammalian  hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). In adipose tissue and heart, HSL
   primarily hydrolyzes  stored  triglycerides  to  free fatty acids, while in
   steroidogenic tissues,  it  principally converts cholesteryl esters to free
   cholesterol for steroid hormone production.
 - Mammalian arylacetamide deacetylase (DAC).
 - Moraxella  strain  TA144  lipase  2  (gene lip2), an enzyme active at a low
   temperature.
 - Acinetobacter  calcoaceticus  esterase  which  seems to be active on simple
   triglycerides such as triacetin.
 - Streptomyces  hygroscopicus  acetyl-hydrolase (gene bah), which removes the
   N-acetyl group from the antibiotic bialaphos.
 - Escherichia coli acetyl esterase aes.

In Moraxella  lip2,  the  mutagenesis  [2]  of either an histidine or a serine
results in  the loss of the activity of the enzyme. These putative active site
residues are  each centered in conserved regions that can be used as signature
patterns.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF](2)-x-[LIVMF]-H-G(2)-[SAG]-[FYW]-x(3)-[STDN]-
                    x(1,2)-[STYA]-[HAGFT]
                    [The first H may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for DAC.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[LIVMF]-[SA]-G-D-S-[CAS]-G-[GA]-x-[LI]-[CAVT]
                    [S may be an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Patterns revised.
