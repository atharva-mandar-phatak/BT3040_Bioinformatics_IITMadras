* Ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) profile *
*********************************************

Covalent modification of proteins by the small, evolutionary conserved protein
ubiquitin (see  <PDOC00271>)  plays  a  central  role in a variety of cellular
processes, including  bulk  protein  degradation,  cell-cycle  control, stress
response, DNA  repair,  signal  transduction,  transcriptional  regulation and
vesicular traffic. A cascade of three enzymes (called E1, E2 and E3) catalyzes
the conjugation  of  ubiquitin  to  lysine  side-chains  of  target  proteins.
Ubiquitination is  a  reversible  process: several specific ubiquitin carboxy-
terminal hydrolases  (UBPs) can remove ubiquitin from proteins. The variety of
cellular processes  regulated  by  ubiquitination  demands  a  high  substrate
specificity of  the  ubiquitination  machinery  as  well  as  the existence of
diverse downstream    effector   proteins   interacting   with   ubiquitinated
substrates. Most  of  these  cellular effectors are characterized by a modular
composition of ubiquitin-binding motifs and further domains mediating specific
functions. The  ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain is a short sequence motif of
~45 amino  acid  residues  that was initially identified in E2s, E3s, UBPs and
several other  proteins having connections to ubiquitin and the ubiquitination
pathway. The  UBA  domain  was  latter  found  to occur frequently either as a
single copy  or  as multiple copies in tandem arrangement in proteins found in
all eukaryotes. In addition to many enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway, the
UBA domain  occurs in UV excision repair proteins and protein kinases involved
in cell-signaling  pathways  and  cell-cycle  control. The UBA domain has been
shown to  bind  ubiquitin but also proteins without ubiquitin-like domains and
lacking an  obvious  link  to  ubiquitin, such as HIV Vpr, 3-methyladenine DNA
glycosylase (MPG) or the nuclear mRNA export factor TAP/Mex67 [1,2,3].

The three  dimensional  structure  of  the UBA domain is a compact three-helix
bundle with an unusually large hydrophobic surface patch (see <PDBD:1DV0>). It
has been  proposed  that  this  hydrophobic surface patch is a common protein-
interacting surface present in diverse UBA domains [3].

Some proteins known to contain an UBA domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian E2-25K and  several  other  ubiquitin-conjugating  enzymes  (E2),
   catalyzing the second step in protein ubiquitination.
 - Drosophila  hyperplastic discs protein, a putative ubiquitin-protein ligase
   (E3), catalyzing the third and final step in protein ubiquitination.
 - Eukaryotic  ubiquitin isopeptidase T and several other ubiquitin C-terminal
   hydrolases, catalyzing regulatory protein de-ubiquitination.
 - Yeast RAD23 and its mammalian homologues. These proteins act in UV excision
   repair and contain a N-terminal domain similar to ubiquitin itself.
 - Yeast DSK2. It is required for spindle pole body duplication.
   This protein contains an N-terminal domain similar to ubiquitin itself.
 - Mammalian  proto-oncogene c-cbl, a protein interacting with multiple signal
   transduction factors.  Cbl  has  recently  been shown to undergo regulatory
   ubiquination upon macrophage stimulation.
 - Drosophila  Ref(2)P  protein  and  its  mammalian homologues.
 - A  large  family  of  SNF1-like  kinases  from  various  plants  and  other
   organisms.
