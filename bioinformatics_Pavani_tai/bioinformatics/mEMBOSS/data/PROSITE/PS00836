* Alanine dehydrogenase and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase signatures *
*****************************************************************************

The following   dehydrogenases   have  been  shown [1]  to  share  regions  of
similarity:

 - Alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1),  an enzyme  which  catalyzes  the  NAD-
   dependent reversible reductive amination of pyruvate into alanine.
 - Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1), which is the enzyme that
   catalyzes the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH with the concomitant oxidation of
   NADH to NAD+. This enzyme is located  in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes
   and  in  the  inner  membrane  of  the  mitochondria  of  eukaryotes.   The
   transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled with the  translocation
   of a proton across the membrane.  In prokaryotes  the enzyme is composed of
   two different subunits:  an alpha chain (gene pntA)  and a beta chain (gene
   pntB) while in eukaryotes it is a single chain protein.

The sequence  of  alanine  dehydrogenase  from  several  bacterial species are
related with  those of the  alpha subunit  of  bacterial  pyridine  nucleotide
transhydrogenase and of the N-terminal half of the eukaryotic enzyme.  The two
most conserved regions correspond respectively  to the N-terminal extremity of
these proteins and  to  a  central  glycine-rich  region  which is part of the
NAD(H)-binding site. We have developed signature patterns for both regions.
