* Colipase family signature and profile *
*****************************************

Colipase [1,2,3] is  a  protein   that  functions as a cofactor for pancreatic
lipase, with  which  it  forms  a stoichiometric complex. It also binds to the
bile-salt covered triacylglycerol interface thus allowing the enzyme to anchor
itself to the water-lipid interface.

As shown  in  the  following  schematic  representation,  colipase  is a small
protein of approximately 100 amino-acid residues with five conserved disulfide
bonds.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

As  a  signature pattern for this family, we chose a region which includes two
of  the  cysteines  involved  in  disulfide  bonds,  as well as three tyrosine
residues  which  seem  to  be  involved  in  the  interfacial binding. We also
developed a profile that covers the whole colipase.

-Consensus pattern: Y-x(2)-Y-Y-x-C-x-C
                    [The 2 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
                    [The 3 Y's are involved in interfacial binding]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2007 / Text revised; profile added.
