* SURF1 family profile *
************************

The surfeit locus 1 gene (SURF1 or surf-1) encodes for a  conserved protein of
about 300 amino-acid residues that  seems  to be involved in the biogenesis of
cytochrome c oxidase [1].  Vertebrate SURF1  is  evolutionary related to yeast
protein SHY1  and  homologous  proteins  have been found in several relatively
recent prokaryotes.  All  known eukaryotic SURF1 sequences are extended on the
N-terminal end as compared to the bacterial species. This extension contains a
typical mitochondrial targeting pre-sequence. In Paracoccus denitrificans, the
SURF1 homologue  is  found in the quinol oxidase operon, suggesting that SURF1
is associated  with  a  primitive  quinol  oxidase  which  belongs to the same
superfamily as cytochrome oxidase [2].

Proteins of  the  SURF1  family contain at least four highly conserved regions
that should  be  essential  for  SURF1  function  and  there  seems  to be two
transmembrane regions  in  these proteins, one in the N-terminal, the other in
the C-terminal [2].

The profile  we  developed covers the two transmembrane domains and the region
in between.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This profile replaces a pattern which sensitivity was inadequate.

-Last update: January 2003 / Pattern removed, profile added and text revised.
