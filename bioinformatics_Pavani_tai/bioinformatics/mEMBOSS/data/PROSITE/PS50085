* Rap GTPase activating proteins domain profile *
*************************************************

Rap  small  G proteins have been implicated in various cellular processes such
as  exocytosis,  cAMP  signalling,  cell  adhesion and cell proliferation. Rap
proteins  acts  as  molecular  switches,  with an active GTP-bound form and an
inactive  GDP-bound  form  [1].  The  inactive  GDP  bound form is promoted by
GTPase-activating  proteins  (GAPs).  GAP  proteins specific for Rap contain a
conserved  region  of  around 200 amino-acid residues, the RapGAP domain. This
domain  can  accelerate  the  GTP hydrolysis activity of Rap by five orders of
magnitude [2].

Some proteins known to contain a Rap-GAP domain are listed below:

 - RAP1 GTPase activating protein (RAP1GAP).
 - Mammalian  tuberin  protein,  the  product of a familial tuberous sclerosis
   gene  which,  when  deleted,  causes  begnin  tumours.  It  also have a GAP
   activity for Rab5 [3].
 - Drosophila Gigas protein, an homologue of tuberin involved in regulation of
   cell cycle.
 - Mammalian tuberin-like protein TULIP.
 - GTPase-activating  protein  Spa-1. It functions as a negative regulator for
   the  activation  of Rap1, thereby having a negative effect on cell adhesion
   [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire RapGAP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
