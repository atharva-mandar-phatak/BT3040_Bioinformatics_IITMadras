* Site-specific recombinases signatures *
*****************************************

Site-specific recombination  plays  an  important role in DNA rearrangement in
prokaryotic organisms.  Two types  of site-specific recombination are known to
occur:

 - Recombination between  inverted repeats  resulting in the reversal of a DNA
   segment.
 - Recombination  between  repeat  sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in
   their cointegration,  or  between  repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in
   the excision of a DNA fragment.

Site-specific recombination  is  characterized by  a strand exchange mechanism
that requires no DNA synthesis or  high  energy  cofactor;  the phosphodiester
bond  energy  is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage
and re-ligation.

Two unrelated  families  of  recombinases  are currently known [1]. The first,
called the `phage integrase' family,  groups  a number of bacterial, phage and
yeast plasmid enzymes.  The second [2],  called the `resolvase' family, groups
enzymes  which share the following  structural  characteristics: an N-terminal
catalytic and  dimerization domain that contains  a conserved   serine residue
involved in  the transient covalent attachment to DNA, and a C-terminal helix-
turn-helix DNA-binding domain.

The resolvase family is currently known to include the following proteins:

 - DNA invertase from Salmonella typhimurium (gene hin).  Hin can invert a 900
   bp DNA fragment adjacent to a gene for one of the flagellar antigens.
 - DNA invertase from Escherichia coli (gene pin).
 - DNA invertase from Bacteriophage Mu (gene gin), P1 and P7 (gene cin).
 - Resolvases from transposons Tn3, Tn21, Tn501, Tn552, Tn917, Tn1546, Tn1721,
   Tn2501 and Tn1000 (known as gamma-delta resolvase).
 - Resolvase from Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP404.
 - Resolvase from Escherichia coli plasmid R46.
 - Resolvase from Escherichia coli plasmid RP4 (gene parA).
 - A putative recombinase from  Bacillus subtilis (gene cisA) [3] which  plays
   an important role in sporulation by  catalyzing the  recombination of genes
   spoIIIC and spoIVCB to form polymerase sigma-K factor.
 - Uvp1, a protein from Escherichia coli plasmid pR  which cooperates with the
   mucAB genes in the DNA repair process and could be a resolvase [4].

Generally, proteins  from  the  resolvase  family  have  180 to 200 amino-acid
residues, excepting cisA which is much larger (500 residues).

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for the resolvase family. The first is
based on  a  highly  conserved region  in  the  N-terminal  extremity of these
proteins; it  contains  a  serine  residue  most probably involved in covalent
attachment to  DNA.  The second pattern is based on a conserved region located
about 50 residues upstream of the serine active site.

-Consensus pattern: Y-[LIVAC]-R-[VA]-S-[ST]-x(2)-Q
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Uvp1 which has Lys instead of Val in position 4 of the pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: a hypothetical  protein from  phage
 Phi-105 which contains only  82 amino acids,  but whose N-terminal section is
 surprisingly similar to that of resolvases and 3 other proteins.

-Consensus pattern: G-[DE]-x(2)-[LIVM]-{E}-x-{V}-[LIVM]-[DT]-R-[LIVM]-[GSA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Tn1546 resolvase and cisA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.
