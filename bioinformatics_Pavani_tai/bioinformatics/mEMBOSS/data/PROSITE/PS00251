* TNF family signature and profile *
************************************

The following  cytokines  can  be  grouped  into  a  family  on  the  basis of
sequence, functional, and structural similarities [1,2,3]:

 - Tumor Necrosis  Factor (TNF)  (also  known as cachectin or TNF-alpha) [4,5]
   is a cytokine which has a wide variety of functions. It can cause cytolysis
   of certain  tumor  cell lines; it is involved in the induction of cachexia;
   it is a potent pyrogen, causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of
   interleukin-1 secretion;    finally, it  can  stimulate  cell proliferation
   and induce  cell  differentiation  under  certain conditions.
 - Lymphotoxin-alpha  (LT-alpha)  and  lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), two related
   cytokines produced by lymphocytes and which are cytotoxic for a wide  range
   of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo [6].
 - T cell antigen gp39 (CD40L), a cytokine which  seems to be important in  B-
   cell development and activation.
 - CD27L,  a  cytokine which plays a role in T-cell activation. It induces the
   proliferation of  costimulated  T cells  and  enhances  the  generation  of
   cytolytic T cells.
 - CD30L, a cytokine which induces proliferation of T cells.
 - FASL, a cytokine involved in cell death [7].
 - 4-1BBL,  a  inducible  T  cell  surface molecule that contributes to T-cell
   stimulation.
 - OX40L,  a  cytokine  that  co-stimulates  T cell proliferation and cytokine
   production [8].
 - TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) [9], a  cytokine that induces
   apoptosis [9].

TNF-alpha is  synthesized  as  a type II membrane protein which then undergoes
post-translational cleavage liberating the extracellular domain. CD27L, CD30L,
CD40L, FASL,  LT-beta,  4-1BBL  and  TRAIL  also appear to be type II membrane
proteins. LT-alpha  is  a  secreted protein. All these cytokines  seem to form
homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that
are recognized by their specific receptors.

As a    signature   for  this  family  of  proteins, we have selected the most
conserved region.    This  region  is  located in a beta-strand in the central
section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LV]-x-[LIVM]-{V}-x-{L}-G-[LIVMF]-Y-[LIVMFY](2)-x(2)-
                    [QEKHL]-[LIVMGT]-x-[LIVMFY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 for OX40L.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
