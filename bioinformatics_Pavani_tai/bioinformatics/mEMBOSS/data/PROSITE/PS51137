*********************
* VM domain profile *
*********************

In Drosophila  melanogaster  the vitelline membrane (VM) is the first layer of
the eggshell produced by the follicular epithelium. It is composed of at least
four different  proteins.  VM  proteins are similarly organized with a central
highly conserved  38-amino  acid domain which is flanked by unrelated regions.
Since the surrounding regions have diverged significantly, it is possible that
the VM domain is of key importance in VM protein structure [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire VM domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: June 2005 / First entry.
