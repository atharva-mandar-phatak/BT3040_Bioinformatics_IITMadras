* CUT domain profile *
**********************

The  CUT  domain,  first discovered in the Drosophila Cut protein, consists of
about  88  amino acids and is a DNA-binding motif which can bind independently
or  in  cooperation  with  the  homeodomain, often found downstream of the CUT
domain.  However,  the  homeodomain  of  this gene family has properties quite
distinct  from  the  classical homeodomain (see <PDOC00027>). On its own these
homeodomain  has  little  DNA-binding  affinity or specificity. DNA-binding is
mediated  mostly  by  the CUT domain, but the sequence specificity and binding
kinetics are greatly influenced by the presence of the homeodomain.

The CUT  proteins  can  be grouped into sub-families according to the presence
of one,  two, or three cut repeats. Congruent with their structural diversity,
these cut-homeoproteins  are  transcriptional regulators that participate in a
variety of functional contexts.

Proteins currently known to contain a CUT domain are:

 -  The  Drosophila Cut  protein and its mammalian homologs (CDP/Cux/Clox, and
    Cux2  proteins). They generally  function as transcriptional repressors in
    both proliferating and differentiating cells.
 -  The SATB1 protein  which contains two cut repeats,  is thought to function
    at the level of chromatin structure to modulate gene activity.
 -  The  mammalian HNF-6  (hepatocyte nuclear factor-6) [2], which defines the
    prototypical Onecut  proteins. It functions  as  a  key regulator of liver
    gene expression.

The profile we developed covers the entire CUT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
