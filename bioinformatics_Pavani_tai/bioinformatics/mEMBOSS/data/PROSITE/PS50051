* MCM family signature and profile *
************************************

Proteins shown to be required for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication
share a highly conserved domain of about 210 amino-acid residues [1,2,3].  The
latter shows some similarities [4] with that of various other families of DNA-
dependent ATPases.  Eukaryotes  seem  to possess a family of six proteins that
contain this  domain.  They  were first identified in yeast where most of them
have a  direct  role  in  the  initiation  of  chromosomal  DNA replication by
interacting directly  with autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). They were
thus called  'minichromosome  maintenance proteins' with gene symbols prefixed
by MCM. These six proteins are:

 - MCM2, also known as cdc19 (in S.pombe) [E1].
 - MCM3, also known as DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme-associated  protein P1,
   RLF beta subunit or ROA.
 - MCM4, also known as CDC54, cdc21 (in S.pombe) or dpa (in Drosophila).
 - MCM5, also known as CDC46 or nda4 (in S.pombe).
 - MCM6, also known as mis5 (in S.pombe).
 - MCM7, also known as CDC47 or Prolifera (in A.thaliana).

This family  is  also  present  in  archebacteria. In Methanococcus jannaschii
there are four members: MJ0363, MJ0961, MJ1489 and MJECL13.

The presence of a putative ATP-binding  domain implies that these proteins may
be involved in an ATP-consuming step in  the  initiation of DNA replication in
eukaryotes.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  perfectly  conserved  region  that
represents a special version of the B motif found in ATP-binding proteins.
