* TFIIE beta central core DNA-binding domain profile *
******************************************************

Initiation of  eukaryotic  mRNA transcription requires melting of promoter DNA
with the  help  of  the  general  transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH. TFIIE
consists of   a  large  and  a  small  subunit,  referred  to  as  alpha  (see
<PDOC51344>) and beta, respectively, in higher eukaryotes. TFIIE beta has been
found to  bind  to  the region where the promoter starts to open to be single-
stranded upon  transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The ~120-residue
central core  domain of TFIIE beta plays a role in double-stranded DNA binding
of TFIIE [1].

The TFIIE  beta central core DNA-binding domain consists of three helices with
a beta  hairpin  at  the C-terminus, resembling the winged helix proteins (see
<PDB:1D8J>). It  shows  a novel double-stranded DNA-binding activity where the
DNA-binding surface  locates  on  the opposite side to the previously reported
winged helix motif by forming a positively charged furrow [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire TFIIE beta central core DNA-binding
domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
