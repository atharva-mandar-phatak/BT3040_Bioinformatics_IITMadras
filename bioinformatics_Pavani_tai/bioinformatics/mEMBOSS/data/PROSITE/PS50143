* BIR repeat signature and profile *
************************************

The 'baculovirus  inhibitior  of  apoptosis  protein  repeat' (BIR) [1,2] is a
domain of about 70 residues arranged in tandem repeats separated by a variable
length linker,  that  seems  to  confer  cell death-preventing activity. It is
found in  proteins  belonging  to  the  IAP  (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins)
family. The  critical  motifs  required  for  anti-apoptotic  activity  of IAP
proteins are  the  BIRs.  All IAP proteins contain from one to three BIRs, and
all known  interactions between IAPs and other proteins are mediated by one or
more BIRs [3].

The BIR domain has a fold that is stabilized by zinc tetrahedrally coordinated
by one  histidine  and three cysteine residues (see <PDB:1QBH>). The structure
consists of  three  short  alpha-helices  and turns with the zinc packed in an
unusually hydrophobic   environment   created  by  residues  that  are  highly
conserved among  all  BIRs.  A subclass of repeats, comprising those at the C-
terminus of  a  series  of  BIR  repeats from IAP proteins bearing RING finger
domains (see <PDOC00449>), are likely to contain a C-terminal region that form
an alpha-helix [3].

Proteins that are known to contain this domain are listed below.

 - Baculoviruses apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs).
 - Mammalian apoptosis inhibitors 1 and 2 (IAP1 and IAP2).
 - Mammalian X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-linked IAP).
 - Chicken IAP (ITA).
 - Human neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP).
 - Drosophila apoptosis inhibitors 1 and 2 (Iap1 and Iap2).
 - African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) protein p27.

BIR contains  a  number of perfectly conserved residues including an histidine
and three  cysteines.  The signature pattern for BIR spans the total length of
the repeat. We also developed a profile that spans the whole repeat.
