* Cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminases zinc-binding region signature *
*************************************************************************

Cytidine deaminase   (EC  3.5.4.5)  (cytidine  aminohydrolase)  catalyzes  the
hydrolysis of   cytidine   into  uridine  and  ammonia  while  deoxycytidylate
deaminase  (EC 3.5.4.12)  (dCMP  deaminase)  hydrolyzes  dCMP  into dUMP. Both
enzymes are known  to bind zinc and to require it for their catalytic activity
[1,2]. These  two  enzymes  do  not  share  any  sequence  similarity with the
exception of a region that  contains  three conserved histidine  and  cysteine
residues which are thought to be involved in the binding of the catalytic zinc
ion.

Such a region is also found in other proteins [3,4]:

 - Yeast cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.1) (gene FCY1) which transforms cytosine
   into uracil.
 - Mammalian  apolipoprotein  B  mRNA  editing  protein,  responsible  for the
   postranscriptional editing  of  a  CAA codon into a UAA (stop) codon in the
   APOB mRNA.
 - Riboflavin   biosynthesis   protein  ribG,  which  converts  2,5-diamino-6-
   (ribosylamino)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate        into       5-amino-6-
   (ribosylamino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5'-phosphate.
 - Bacillus cereus blasticidin-S deaminase (EC 3.5.4.23),  which catalyzes the
   deamination of  the  cytosine  moiety  of  the  antibiotics  blasticidin S,
   cytomycin and acetylblasticidin S.
 - Bacillus subtilis protein comEB.  This  protein is required for the binding
   and uptake of transforming DNA.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yaaJ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfhC.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJL035c.

We have derived a signature pattern for this zinc-binding region.

-Consensus pattern: [CH]-[AGV]-E-x(2)-[LIVMFGAT]-[LIVM]-x(17,33)-P-C-x(2,8)-C-
                    x(3)-[LIVM]
                    [The C's and H are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
