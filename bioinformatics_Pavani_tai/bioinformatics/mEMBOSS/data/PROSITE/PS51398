* PAW domain profile *
**********************

The PAW  domain  (present  in  PNGases  and other worm proteins) is found as a
single copy  at the C-terminus of metazoan peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) and in
multiple copies  in  hypothetical  Caenorhabditis  elegans proteins peptide:N-
glycanases (PNGases)  [1].  The  C-terminal  PAW domain of PNGase binds to the
mannose moieties of N-linked oligosaccharide chains [2].

The PAW  domain  is a slightly elongated molecule and displays a beta-sandwich
architecture, which  is  composed  of  two  layers,  containing nine and eight
antiparallel beta-strands,  respectively,  and  three additional short helices
(see <PDB:2G9G>) [2].

Some proteins known to contain a PAW domain are listed below:

 - Animal   peptide:N-glycanase   (PNGase)   (EC   3.5.1.52),   catalyzes  the
   deglycosylation of several misfolded N-linked glycoproteins by cleaving the
   bulky glycan chain before the proteins are degraded by the proteasome.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans putative uncharacterized protein C17B7.5.

The profile we developed covers the entire PAW domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
