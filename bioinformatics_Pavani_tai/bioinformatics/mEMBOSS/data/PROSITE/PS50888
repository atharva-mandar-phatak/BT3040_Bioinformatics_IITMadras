* Myc-type, 'helix-loop-helix' domain profile *
***********************************************

A number of  eukaryotic proteins,  which probably  are sequence specific  DNA-
binding proteins that act as transcription  factors,  share a conserved domain
of 40 to 50 amino acid residues.  It has been proposed [1] that this domain is
formed  of two amphipathic helices  joined by  a variable length linker region
that could form a loop.  This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein
dimerization and  has  been  found  in  the  proteins listed below [2,3]. Most
of these  proteins  have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues
that is  adjacent  to  the HLH domain and specifically binds to  DNA. They are
refered as  basic helix-loop-helix  proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two
groups: class  A  (ubiquitous)  and  class B (tissue-specific). Members of the
bHLH family  bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also refered to as
the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerization mediated by the HLH domain is
independent of,  but  necessary  for  DNA  binding,  as  two basic regions are
required for  DNA  binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain
(Emc, Id)  function  as  negative regulators since they form heterodimers, but
fail to  bind  DNA.  The  hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also
repress transcription  although    they  can  bind  DNA.  The proteins of this
subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their
C-terminal motif WRPW.

 - The myc family  of cellular oncogenes [4],  which  is  currently  known  to
   contain four  members:  c-myc,  N-myc,  L-myc, and B-myc. The myc genes are
   thought to play a role in cellular differentiation and proliferation.
 - Proteins involved in myogenesis (the induction of muscle cells). In mammals
   MyoD1 (Myf-3),  myogenin (Myf-4),  Myf-5, and  Myf-6 (Mrf4 or herculin), in
   birds CMD1 (QMF-1), in  Xenopus MyoD and MF25,  in  Caenorhabditis  elegans
   CeMyoD, and in Drosophila nautilus (nau).
 - Vertebrate proteins that bind specific DNA sequences ('E boxes') in various
   immunoglobulin  chains  enhancers: E2A or ITF-1 (E12/pan-2 and  E47/pan-1),
   ITF-2 (tcf4), TFE3, and TFEB.
 - Vertebrate neurogenic differentiation factor 1 that acts as differentiation
   factor during neurogenesis.
 - Vertebrate MAX  protein, a  transcription regulator  that forms a sequence-
   specific DNA-binding protein complex with myc or mad.
 - Vertebrate   Max  Interacting  Protein  1 (MXI1  protein)  which  acts as a
   transcriptional repressor and  may antagonize myc transcriptional  activity
   by competing for max.
 - Proteins of the bHLH/PAS superfamily which  are transcriptional activators.
   In mammals, AH receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), single-minded homologs
   (SIM1 and SIM2),  hypoxia-inducible  factor 1  alpha  (HIF1A), AH  receptor
   (AHR), neuronal  pas  domain  proteins  (NPAS1  and NPAS2), endothelial pas
   domain protein  1  (EPAS1),  mouse  ARNT2, and human BMAL1. In  drosophila,
   single-minded  (SIM),  AH receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), trachealess
   protein (TRH), and similar protein (SIMA).
 - Mammalian transcription factors HES, which  repress transcription by acting
   on two types of DNA sequences, the E box and the N box.
 - Mammalian   MAD  protein (max dimerizer)  which  acts  as   transcriptional
   repressor and may antagonize myc transcriptional  activity by competing for
   max.
 - Mammalian  Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2),  which bind
   to  a  symmetrical  DNA  sequence that is found in a variety  of viral  and
   cellular promoters.
 - Human lyl-1 protein; which is involved, by chromosomal translocation, in T-
   cell leukemia.
 - Human transcription factor AP-4.
 - Mouse  helix-loop-helix  proteins  MATH-1  and MATH-2 which activate E box-
   dependent transcription in collaboration with E47.
 - Mammalian stem cell protein (SCL) (also known as tal1), a protein which may
   play an important role in hemopoietic differentiation. SCL is involved, by
   chromosomal translocation, in stem-cell leukemia.
 - Mammalian proteins Id1 to Id4 [5].  Id (inhibitor of DNA binding)  proteins
   lack a  basic  DNA-binding  domain  but  are able to form heterodimers with
   other HLH proteins, thereby inhibiting binding to DNA.
 - Drosophila extra-macrochaetae (emc)  protein, which participates in sensory
   organ patterning  by  antagonizing the neurogenic  activity of the achaete-
   scute complex. Emc is the homolog of mammalian Id proteins.
 - Human   Sterol   Regulatory   Element   Binding   Protein  1  (SREBP-1),  a
   transcriptional activator  that  binds  to  the sterol regulatory element 1
   (SRE-1) found in the flanking region of the LDLR gene and in other genes.
 - Drosophila  achaete-scute (AS-C)  complex  proteins  T3 (l'sc), T4 (scute),
   T5 (achaete)  and  T8 (asense).  The AS-C  proteins  are  involved  in  the
   determination  of  the neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system
   and the central nervous system.
 - Mammalian  homologs   of  achaete-scute  proteins, the  MASH-1  and  MASH-2
   proteins.

 - Drosophila atonal protein (ato) which is involved in neurogenesis.
 - Drosophila daughterless (da) protein, which is  essential  for neurogenesis
   and sex-determination.
 - Drosophila deadpan  (dpn), a hairy-like protein involved in the  functional
   differentiation of neurons.
 - Drosophila delilah (dei) protein,  which is plays an important role  in the
   differentiation of epidermal cells into muscle.
 - Drosophila  hairy (h)  protein, a transcriptional repressor which regulates
   the embryonic segmentation and adult bristle patterning.
 - Drosophila enhancer of split  proteins E(spl), that are hairy-like proteins
   active during neurogenesis. also act as transcriptional repressors.
 - Drosophila twist (twi) protein, which  is involved in  the establishment of
   germ layers in embryos.

 - Maize anthocyanin regulatory proteins R-S and LC.

 - Yeast centromere-binding protein 1 (CPF1 or CBF1). This protein is involved
   in chromosomal segregation.  It  binds  to a highly conserved DNA sequence,
   found in centromers and in several promoters.
 - Yeast INO2 and INO4 proteins.
 - Yeast  phosphate  system  positive  regulatory protein PHO4 which interacts
   with the upstream activating sequence of several acid phosphatase genes.
 - Yeast  serine-rich  protein  TYE7  that  is  required  for ty-mediated ADH2
   expression.
 - Neurospora crassa  nuc-1, a protein  that  activates  the  transcription of
   structural genes for phosphorus acquisition.
 - Fission yeast protein esc1 which  is involved in the sexual differentiation
   process.
