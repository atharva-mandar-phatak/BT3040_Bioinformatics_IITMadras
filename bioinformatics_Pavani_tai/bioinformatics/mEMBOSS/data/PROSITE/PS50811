* WRKY domain profile *
***********************

The  WRKY  domain  is  a 60 amino acid region that is defined by the conserved
amino  acid  sequence  WRKYGQK  at  its  N-terminal end, together with a novel
zinc-finger-like motif.  The  WRKY  domain  is found in one or two copies in a
superfamily  of  plant  transcription  factors  involved  in the regulation of
various  physiological  programs that are unique to plants, including pathogen
defense,  senescence,  trichome  development and the biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites.  The  WRKY  domain  binds  specifically to the DNA sequence motif
(T)(T)TGAC[CT], which is known as the W box. The  invariant TGAC core of the W
box is essential for function and WRKY binding [1].

Some proteins known to contain a WRKY domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana Zinc-dependent Activator Protein-1 (ZAP1).
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana   AtWRKY44/TTG2,  a  protein  involved  in  trichome
   development and anthocyanin pigmentation.
 - Wild  oat  ABF1-2,  two  proteins  involved  in the gibberelic acid-induced
   expression of the alpha-Amy2 gene.

The profile we developed covers the entire WRKY domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
