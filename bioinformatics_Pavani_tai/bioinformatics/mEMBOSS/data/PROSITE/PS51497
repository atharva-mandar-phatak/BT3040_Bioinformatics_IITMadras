* UMA domain profile *
**********************

A key  aspect  of eukaryotic intracellular trafficking is the sorting of cell-
surface proteins  into  multi-vesicular  endosomes  or  bodies  (MVBs),  which
eventually fuse  with  the  lysosome,  where  they are degraded by lipases and
peptidases. This is the primary mechanism for down-regulation of signaling via
transmembrane receptors   and  removal  of  misfolded  or  defective  membrane
proteins. This  process  is  also  utilized by several viruses (e.g. HIV-1) to
facilitate budding of their virions from the cell-membrane. Studies in animals
and fungi  have  shown that it depends on an intricate series of interactions,
which is   initiated   via   ubiquitination   (typically  one  or  more  mono-
ubiquitinations) of  the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins by specific E3
ligases. Ubiquitinated  membrane  proteins are then captured into endosomes by
the ESCRT system and prevented from being recycled back to the plasma membrane
via the  retrograde  trafficking  system.  The  ESCRT  system  also  folds the
endosomal membranes   into   invaginations  that  are  concentrated  in  these
ubiquitinated targets  and  catalyzes  their  abscission  into  intra-luminal-
vesicles inside  the  endosome.  This largely seals the fate of these membrane
proteins as  targets  for lysosomal degradation. The ESCRT system is comprised
of 4  major  protein  complexes,  ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-III, which are successively
involved in the above-described steps [1].

ESCRT-I contains  three subunits that are conserved between yeast and animals,
namely the   inactive   E2-ligase   protein  TSG101/VPS23,  VPS28  and  VPS37.
Additionally, both  yeast and metazoan ESCRT-I contain a fourth subunit termed
MVB12 (“multivesicular  body  sorting  factor  of  12 kD”); however, the MVB12
subunits from  the  two  lineages do not show significant sequence similarity.
The metazoan  MVB12 proteins contain two distinct conserved domains that occur
independently in  various  proteins.  The C-terminal region of MVB12, which is
shared with  ubiquitin  associated  protein-1  (UBAP1),  forms the UBAP1-MVB12
associated (UMA) domain. Human UBAP1 is implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
risk and  fronto-temporal  lobar degeneration. The UMA domain is also found in
several other poorly characterized proteins, including at leat one orthologous
group of  proteins  conserved  in  vertebrates prototyped be the human protein
LOC390595 and  another  group  conserved  across  Metazoa  typified  by  human
tcag7.903. The  UMA  domain  found  in MVB12 and UBAP1 defines a novel adaptor
that might  recruit  diverse  targets  to  ESCRT-I. The different UMA proteins
might function  as  alternative  as  MVB12-like subunit that recruit different
targets via their specific intercation modules (such as MABP (see <PDOC51498>)
or UBA  (see  <PDOC50030>)  or the specific extensions) to the ESCRT-I complex
[1].

The UMA  domain contains a conserved proline followed by a hydrophobic residue
in the  N-terminus  and  a  nearly  absolutely  conserved  glutamate at the C-
terminus. It is predicted to adopt an alpha+beta fold [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire UMA domain.
