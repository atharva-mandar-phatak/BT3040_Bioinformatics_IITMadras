* HORMA domain profile *
************************

The  HORMA  domain (for HOP1, REV7 and MAD2)  is an  about 180-240 amino acids
region  containing  several  conserved  motifs.  Whereas the MAD2 and the REV7
proteins  are almost entirely made up of HORMA domains,  HOP1 contains a HORMA
domain  in  its  N-terminal  region  and  a  Zn-finger  domain,  whose general
arrangement  of metal-chelating residues is similar to that of the PHD finger,
in  the  C-terminal  region.  The  HORMA domain is found in proteins showing a
direct  association  with chromatin of all crown group eukaryotes. It has been
suggested  that  the HORMA domain recognizes chromatin states that result from
DNA  adducts, double-stranded breaks or non-attachment to the spindle and acts
as an adaptor that recruits other proteins involved in repair [1].

Secondary  structure prediction suggests that the HORMA domain is globular and
could  potentially  form a complex beta-sheet(s) with associated alpha-helices
[1].

Some proteins known to contain a HORMA domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic  HOP1,  a   conserved  protein  that  is  involved  in  meiotic-
   synaptonemal-complex assembly.
 - Eukaryotic  mitotic-arrest-deficient  2  protein (MAD2), a key component of
   the mitotic-spindle-assembly checkpoint.
 - Eukaryotic  REV7,  a subunit of the DNA polymerase zeta that is involved in
   translesion, template-independent DNA synthesis.

We have developed a profile that covers the entire HORMA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
