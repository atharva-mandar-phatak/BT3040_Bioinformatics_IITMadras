* Zinc finger TFIIB-type profile *
**********************************

In eukaryotes the initiation of transcription of protein encoding genes by the
polymerase  II  complexe  (Pol  II)  is  modulated  by  general  and  specific
transcription  factors.  The  general  transcription  factors  operate through
common  promoters  elements  (such  as the TATA box). At least seven different
proteins  associate  to  form  the general transcription factors: TFIIA, -IIB,
-IID, -IIE, -IIF, -IIG, and -IIH [1].

TFIIB  and TFIID are responsible for promoter recognition and interaction with
pol  II; together with Pol II, they form a minimal initiation complex, capable
of  transcription  under certain conditions. The TATA box of a Pol II promoter
is  bound  in  the initiation complex by the TBP subunit of TFIID, which bends
the  DNA  around  the C-terminal domain of TFIIB (see <PDOC00624>) whereas the
N-terminal zinc finger of TFIIB interacts with Pol II [2,3].

The  TFIIB  zinc  finger  adopts  a  zinc  ribbon  fold  characterized  by two
beta-haipins  forming  two  structurally  similar  zinc-binding sub-sites (see
<PDB:1PFT>)  [4].  The zinc finger contacts the rbp1 subunit of Pol II through
its  dock  domain, a conserved region of about 70 amino acids located close to
the  polymerase  active  site  [5,6].  In  the  Pol II complex this surface is
located  near  the  RNA  exit  groove [6]. Interestingly this sequence is best
conserved   in  the  three  polymerases  that  utilize  a  TFIIB-like  general
transcription factor (Pol II, Pol III, and archaeal RNA polymerase) but not in
Pol I [6].

The profile we developed covers the whole TFIIB zinc finger.
