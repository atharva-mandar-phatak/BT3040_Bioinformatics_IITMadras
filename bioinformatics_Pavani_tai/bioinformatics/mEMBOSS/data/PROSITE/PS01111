* RNA polymerases K / 14 to 18 Kd subunits signature *
******************************************************

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing  different sets of genes. Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

A component  of  14  to  18  Kd  shared  by  all three forms of eukaryotic RNA
polymerases and  which  has  been  sequenced  in  budding  yeast (gene RPB6 or
RPO26), in  fission  yeast (gene rpb6 or rpo15), in human and in African swine
fever virus [1] is evolutionary related [2] to archaebacterial subunit K (gene
rpoK). The archaebacterial protein is colinear with the C-terminal part of the
eukaryotic subunit.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x-[FY]-E-x-[AT]-R-x-[LIVM]-[GSA]-x-R-[SA]-x-Q
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
