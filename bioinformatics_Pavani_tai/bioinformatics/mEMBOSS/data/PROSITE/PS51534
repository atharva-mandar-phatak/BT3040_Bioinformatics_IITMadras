* SEFIR domain profile *
************************

The SEFIR  domain  (after  SEFs  and  IL17Rs)  is a conserved sequence segment
identified in  transmembrane  receptors  (including  SEFs, IL17Rs) and soluble
factors (including  CIKS/ACT1)  in eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to the
SEFIR sequence  homology,  SEFs  and IL17Rs share the same architecture. Their
extracellular regions  are  sequentially  divergent  but  appear  structurally
similar to  a  tandem  fibronectin  3  (FN3)-like domain arrangement. A single
transmembrane region   is   followed  by  a  high-complexity  sequence  region
involving the  SEFIR  domain and a C-terminal tail that is enriched with polar
residues and, sometimes, with low complexity regions [1].

The SEFIR  domain  is  related  to the TIR domain (see <PDOC50104>). The SEFIR
domain is  similar  to  the  TIR domain in length and secondary structure. The
similarity between  the  SEFIR  and TIR domains involves the conserved boxes 1
and 2  of  the  TIR  domain that are implicated in homotypic dimerization, but
there is no sequence similarity between SEFIR domains and the TIR sequence box
3 [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire SEFIR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
