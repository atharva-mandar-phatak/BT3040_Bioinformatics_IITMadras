* Prokaryotic zinc-dependent phospholipase C domain signature and profile *
***************************************************************************

Bacillus cereus expresses  a phosphatidylcholine  hydrolyzing  phospholipase C
(EC 3.1.4.3) (PLC) which  is a  monomeric  protein  of 245 amino-acid residues
that binds three zinc ions [1].  This  PLC is  highly similar to the following
proteins:

 - Alpha-toxin from Clostridium  perfringens and bifermentans  which  are also
   zinc-dependent phospholipases C [2].
 - Lecithinase C from Listeria monocytogenes [3].

In Bacillus  cereus,  there  are nine residues known to be involved in binding
the zinc ions: 5 His, 2 Asp, 1 Glu and 1 Trp. These residues are all conserved
in the Clostridium alpha-toxin [4].

As  a  signature  pattern  for this family of enzymes, we selected a conserved
region  of  11  residues  that contains three of the zinc ligands: a histidine
involved  in binding the first zinc ion, an aspartic acid which binds both the
first and the third zinc ion, and a histidine which binds the second zinc ion.
We  also developed a profile that covers the entire prokaryotic zinc-dependent
phospholipase C domain.

-Consensus pattern: H-Y-x-[GT]-D-[LIVMAF]-[DNSH]-x-P-x-H-[PA]-x-N
                    [The 2 H's and the D bind zinc]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2007 / Text revised; profile added.
