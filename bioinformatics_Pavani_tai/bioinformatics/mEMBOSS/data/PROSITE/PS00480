* Citrate synthase signature *
******************************

Citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1) (CS) is the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme that
catalyzes the  synthesis of citrate  from  oxaloacetate  and acetyl-CoA  in an
aldol condensation.  CS can directly form  a carbon-carbon bond in the absence
of metal ion cofactors.

In prokaryotes, citrate synthase is  composed of six  identical  subunits.  In
eukaryotes, there are two isozymes of citrate synthase: one is found    in the
mitochondrial matrix,  the  second  is  cytoplasmic. Both seem to be dimers of
identical chains.

There are a number of  regions of sequence  similarity between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic citrate  synthases.  One of the best conserved contains a histidine
which is  one  of  three  residues  shown  [1] to be involved in the catalytic
mechanism of  the  vertebrate  mitochondrial  enzyme. We used this region as a
signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-[FYAV]-[GA]-H-x-[IV]-x(1,2)-[RKTQ]-x(2)-[DV]-[PS]-R
                    [H is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
