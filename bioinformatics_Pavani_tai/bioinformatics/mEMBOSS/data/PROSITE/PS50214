* Disintegrin domain signature and profile *
********************************************

Disintegrins [1,2]  are  snake  venom   proteins   which  inhibit   fibrinogen
interaction  with  platelet  receptors  expressed on the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa
complex. They act by binding to the integrin glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor on
the  platelet  surface and  inhibit  aggregation  induced  by  ADP,  thrombin,
platelet-activating factor and collagen.

Disintegrins are peptides of about  70 amino  acid residues that contain  many
cysteines all  involved  in disulfide bonds [3].  Disintegrins contain an Arg-
Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, a recognition site of many adhesion proteins.  The RGD
sequence  of disintegrins is postulated to interact with the glycoprotein IIb-
IIIa complex.

The sequences of disintegrins from  different  snake  species are known. These
proteins  are  known  as:  albolabrin,   applagin,  barbourin,  batroxostatin,
bitistatin, echistatin, elegantin, eristicophin, flavoridin, halysin, kistrin,
tergeminin and triflavin.

Some other proteins are known to contain a disintegrin domain:

 - Some  snake    venom  zinc metalloproteinases [4]  consist of an N-terminal
   catalytic domain  fused  to  a  disintegrin  domain.  Such  is the case for
   trimerelysin I    (HR1B),   atrolysin e (Ht-e)  and  trigramin. It has been
   suggested  that  these proteinases  are  able to cleave themselves from the
   disintegrin domains  and  that  the  latter  may  arise  from  such a post-
   translational processing.
 - ADAM type metalloproteases (see <PDOC50215>).
 - Mammalian epididymial protein 1 (EAP I) [6].  EAP I is  associated with the
   sperm membrane and may play a role in sperm maturation. Structurally, EAP I
   consists of  an  N-terminal  domain,  followed  by a zinc metalloproteinase
   domain, a disintegrin domain, and a large C-terminal domain that contains a
   transmembrane region.

The schematic  representation of the structure of a typical disintegrin domain
is shown below:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

Short disintegrins lack the N-terminal of the domain.

As a    signature  pattern for the disintegrin domain, we selected a conserved
central region  that  contains  five  of  the  cysteines involved in disulfide
bonds. A profile was also developed that spans the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-[GS]-x-C-C-x(1,2)-[NQRSEKD]-C-x-[FMYLVI]-x(6)-C-

                    [The 5 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
