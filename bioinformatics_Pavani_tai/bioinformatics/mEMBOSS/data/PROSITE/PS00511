***************************************************

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)  (corticoliberin) [1] is  a hormone  from
the hypothalamus  that  regulates  the release  of  corticotropin  (ACTH) from
the pituitary  gland.  CRF is evolutionary related to a number of other active
peptides which are listed below.

 - Urocortin (Ucn) [2], a brain mammalian peptide with corticotropin-releasing
   factor activity.
 - Urotensin 1 from the urophysis of fish. Like CRF and Ucn, it  acts  in ACTH
   secretion.
 - Sauvagine from frog skin, a peptide  with a  potent hypotensive action that
   elicits a diuretic effect.
 - Diuretic  hormone (DH) (or diuretic peptide (DP) from a variety of insects.
   DH is involved in the regulation of fluid secretion [3].

All these hormones are peptides of about 40 amino acid  residues  which are C-
terminally amidated and processed from a larger precursor protein.  We derived
a signature pattern  of conserved  residues, running  from position 4 to 19 in
these peptides.

-Consensus pattern: [PQA]-x-[LIVM]-S-[LIVM]-x(2)-[PST]-[LIVMF]-x-[LIVM]-L-R-
                    x(2)-[LIVMW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for diuretic hormone 2 from tobacco hornworm.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
