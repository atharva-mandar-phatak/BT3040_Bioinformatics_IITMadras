Phosphagen (guanidino)  kinases,  including  creatine  kinase  (CK),  arginine
kinase (AK),  taurocyamine  kinase  (TK), lombricine kinase (LK), glycocyamine
kinase (GK),  and hypotaurocyamine kinase (HTK), are enzymes that catalyze the
reversible transfer  of  the  gamma-phosphoryl group of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) to  naturally  occuring  guanidino compounds such as creatine, arginine,
yelding adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP) and a phosphorylated guanidine typically
referred to  as phosphagen (phosphocreatine, phosphoarginine and etc). Members
of this  enzyme  family play a key role in animals as ATP-buffering systems in
cells that display high and variable rates of ATP turnover. Phosphagen kinases
have been  found  in  all  animal  species  and  in  some  protozoa,  such  as
trypanosomes, choanoflagellates,  and  the  ciliates,  Paramecium tetraurelia,
Paramecium caudatum, and Tetrahymena. Eukaryotic phosphagen kinases consist of
a small,  ~100-residue,  alpha-helical  N-terminal  domain and a larger, 250+-
residue, C-terminal  alpha/beta  saddle  domain  in  which  many  key residues
involved in  catalysis  are  found  (see  <PDB:3L2E>).  The  N-terminal domain
undergoes significant  conformational movements during catalysis, closing down
on the  catalytic  pocket.  It  is  involved  in  dimer  formation.  Bacterial
phosphagen kinases  have  the  large  C-terminal  domain  seen  in  eukaryotic
phosphagen kinases but lack the N-terminal domain [1,2,3,4].

A cysteine  residue  is implicated in the catalytic activity of these enzymes.
The region around this active site residue is highly conserved and can be used
as a   signature   pattern.  We  also  developed  two  profiles,  which  cover
respectively the entire phosphagen kinase N- and C-terminal domains.
