**********************************************
* Xanthine/uracil permeases family signature *
**********************************************

The following transport proteins  which are involved in the uptake of xanthine
or uracil are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Uric uric acid-xanthine permease (gene uapA) from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - Purine permease (gene uapC) from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - Xanthine permease from Bacillus subtilis (gene pbuX).
 - Uracil  permease  from  Escherichia coli (gene uraA) [2] and Bacillus (gene
   pyrP).
 - Hypothetical protein ycdG from Escherichia coli.
 - Hypothetical protein ygfO from Escherichia coli.
 - Hypothetical protein ygfU from Escherichia coli.
 - Hypothetical protein yicE from Escherichia coli.
 - Hypothetical protein yunJ from Bacillus subtilis.
 - Hypothetical protein yunK from Bacillus subtilis.

They are  proteins  of  from  430  to  595  residues  that  seem to contain 12
transmembrane domains. As a signature pattern, we  selected the best conserved
region which  corresponds  with  what  seems  to  be  the  tenth transmembrane
domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-P-x-[PASIF]-V-[LIVMG]-[GF]-[GA]-x(4)-[LIVM]-[FY]-
                    [GSA]-x-[LIVM]-x(3)-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
