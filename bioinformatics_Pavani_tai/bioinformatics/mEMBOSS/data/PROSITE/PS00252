* Interferon alpha, beta and delta family signature *
*****************************************************

Interferons [1] are  proteins  which  produce antiviral  and antiproliferative
responses in cells.  On the basis of their sequence interferons are classified
into five groups:  alpha, alpha-II  (or  omega), beta,  delta (or trophoblast)
[2] and gamma. Except for gamma-interferon, the sequence of all the others are
related.  Once the  signal  peptide  has  been  removed, these interferons are
mature proteins of 160 to 170 residues.

A disulfide bond  is  one  of  the  best  conserved structural features of the
proteins belonging  to  this family. The signature pattern  for this family of
proteins includes one of the cysteines involved in this disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: [FYH]-[FY]-x-[GNRCDS]-[LIVM]-x(2)-[FYL]-L-x(7)-[CY]-[AT]-W
                    [The second C is involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Except for mouse interferon-beta, all  proteins from this family have a
 cysteine in position 10 of the pattern.
