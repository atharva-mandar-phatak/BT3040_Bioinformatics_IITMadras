* MHYT domain profile *
***********************

The MHYT  domain  is  an  about  190-residue domain, which was named after its
conserved amino  acid  pattern.  The  MHYT  domain  consists  of six predicted
transmembrane (TM)  segments,  connected  by  short  arginine-rich cytoplasmic
loops and periplasmic loops that are also rich in charged amino acid residues.
Three of  its  TM  segments have a very similar amino acid sequence motif with
highly conserved  methionine, histidine and tyrosine residues located near the
outer face  of  the  cytoplasmic  membrane.  The MHYT domain has been found in
several phylogenetically distant bacteria, either as a separate, single domain
protein, or   fused   to   a   LytTR-type  DNA-binding  helix-turn-helix  (see
<PDOC50930>), or  fused  to  signaling  domains, such as histidine kinase (see
<PDOC50109>), GGDEF  (see  <PDOC50887>),  EAL  (see <PDOC50883>), and PAS (see
<PDOC50112>). It  has  been  proposed  that the MHYT domain serves as a sensor
domain in  some bacterial two-component signal transduction systems as well as
in a  variety of other bacterial proteins. A model of the membrane topology of
the MHYT  domain indicates that its conserved residues could coordinate one or
two copper ions, suggesting a role in sensing oxygen, CO or NO [1].

Some proteins known to contain a MHYT domain are listed below:

 - Bacillus  subtilis  ykoW. It is expressed during logarithmic growth in rich
   medium.
 - Synechocystis sp. sensory transduction histidine kinase slr2098.
 - Oligotropha carboxidovorans coxC and coxH proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire MHYT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
