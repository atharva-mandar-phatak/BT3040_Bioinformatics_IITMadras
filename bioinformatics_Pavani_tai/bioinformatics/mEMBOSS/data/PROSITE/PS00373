* Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase active site *
***********************************************************

Phosphoribosylglycinamide  formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) (GART) [1] catalyzes
the third step in de novo  purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group
to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide.  In  higher  eukaryotes, GART  is  part  of a
multifunctional enzyme polypeptide that catalyzes three of the steps of purine
biosynthesis. In  bacteria, plants and yeast, GART is a monofunctional protein
of about 200 amino-acid residues.

In the Escherichia coli enzyme, an aspartic acid  residue has been shown to be
involved  in the  catalytic mechanism.   The  region  around  this active site
residue is well  conserved in GART from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources and
can be used as a signature pattern.

Mammalian formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) [2] is a cytosolic
enzyme  responsible  for  the  NADP-dependent   decarboxylative  reduction  of
10-formyltetrahydrofolate  into  tetrahydrofolate.  It  is a  protein of about
900 amino  acids  consisting  of  three  domains;  the  N-terminal domain (200
residues) is structurally related to GARTs.

Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase  (EC 2.1.2.9) (gene fmt) [3]
is the  enzyme responsible for modifying the free amino group of the aminoacyl
moiety of  methionyl-tRMA(fMet).    The  central  part  of  fmt  seems  to  be
evolutionary related to GART's active site region.
