* KHA domain profile *
**********************

Potassium channels   take  part  in  important  processes  of  higher  plants,
including opening  and  closing  of  stomatal  pores and leaf movement. Inward
rectifying potassium  (K(+)in)  channels  play  an  important  role  in turgor
regulation and  ion  uptake in higher plants. All of them comprise, from their
N-terminal to their C-terminal ends: a short hydrophilic region, a hydrophobic
region structurally  analogous  and  partially homologous to the transmembrane
domain of  voltage-gated  animal  channels  from  the  Shaker  superfamily,  a
putative cyclic  nucleotide-binding  domain (see <PDOC00691>), and a conserved
C-terminal KHA  domain.  Between  these  last two regions, some of them (AKT1,
AKT2 and  SKT1)  contain  an  ankyrin-repeat domain (see <PDOC50088>) with six
repeats homologous  to  those  of human erythrocyte ankyrin. The KHA domain is
unique to  plant  K(+)in  channels.  The KHA domain contains two high-homology
blocks enriched  for  hydrophobic  and  acidic residues, respectively. The KHA
domain is  essential  for interaction of plant K(+)in channels. The KHA domain
mediates tetramerization and/or stabilization of the heteromers [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a KHA domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana AKT1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana AKT2/3.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana KAT1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana KAT2.
 - Potato KST1.
 - Potato SKT1.
 - Potato SKT2.
 - Potato SKT3.

The profile we developed covers the entire KHA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
