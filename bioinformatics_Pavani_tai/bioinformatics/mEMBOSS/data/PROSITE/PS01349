* Nodulation protein nodA signature *
*************************************

Symbiosis between  Rhizobia  and  legumes  leads to the formation of nitrogen-
fixing nodules.  Bacteria  produce  lipochitooligosaccharides signals, the Nod
factors, which  act  as  morphogens  to  trigger  the  formation of nodules on
plants. Several genes are involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the
Nod factors. The nodA protein [1] encodes an N-acyltransferase which transfers
an acyl chain to the nonreducing end of the chitooligosaccharide.

NodA is  a  protein  of  about  200  to 220 amino-acid residues. We selected a
conserved region in the first third of the protein.
