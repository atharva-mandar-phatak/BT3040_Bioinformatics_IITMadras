* L-type lectin-like (leguminous) domain profile *
**************************************************

The carbohydrate  recognition  domain (CRD) of the following proteins shares a
striking  structural  similarity  with  calcium-dependent  L-type (leguminous)
lectins:

 - Yeast  proteins EMP46  and  EMP47,  type  I  membrane proteins, which cycle
   between the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus by vesicles
   coated with  coat  protein  complexes  I  and II (COPI and COPII). They are
   considered to   function   as   cargo   reveptors  for  exporting  N-linked
   glycoproteins from the ER.
 - Animal  p58/ERGIC-53,  a  calcium-dependent  lectin that cycles between the
   endoplasmic reticulum  (ER)  and  the Golgi complex and appears to act as a
   cargo receptor for a subset of soluble glycoproteins exported from the ER.
 - Mammalian  vesicular-integral protein of 36 kDa (VIP36), a transport lectin
   for trafficking  certain  high-mannose  type  glycoproteins  in  the  early
   secretory pathway.

The L-type  lectin-like  domain  has  an  overall globular shape composed of a
beta-sandwich of  two major twisted antiparallel beta-sheets (see <PDB:1GV9>).
The beta-sandwich  comprises  a  major  concave  beta-sheet and a minor convex
beta-sheet, in a variation of the jelly roll fold [1-4].

The profile we developed covers the entire L-type lectin-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
