***********************************

Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) (GS)  [1] plays  an  essential  role  in the
metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia
to form glutamine.

There seem to be three different classes of GS [2,3,4]:

 - Class I enzymes (GSI) are specific to prokaryotes, and are  oligomers of 12
   identical subunits.  The  activity  of GSI-type enzyme is controlled by the
   adenylation of a tyrosine residue. The adenylated enzyme is inactive.
 - Class II enzymes (GSII) are  found in  eukaryotes and in bacteria belonging
   to the Rhizobiaceae,  Frankiaceae,  and  Streptomycetaceae  families (these
   bacteria have  also a class-I GS). GSII are octamer  of identical subunits.
   Plants have  two  or  more  isozymes  of  GSII,  one  of  the  isozymes  is
   translocated into the chloroplast.
 - Class III enzymes (GSIII) has, currently,  only  been  found in Bacteroides
   fragilis and  in  butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens.  It is a hexamer of identical
   chains. It is much larger (about 700 amino acids) than the  GSI (450 to 470
   amino acids) or GSII (350 to 420 amino acids) enzymes.

While the three classes of GS's are clearly structurally related, the sequence
similarities are not so extensive.    As signature  patterns we selected three
conserved regions.   The first pattern is based on a conserved tetrapeptide in
the N-terminal  section of  the enzyme,  the second one is based on a glycine-
rich region which is thought to be involved in ATP-binding.  The third pattern
is specific to class I glutamine synthetases and includes the tyrosine residue
which is reversibly adenylated.

 GS, except for Clostridium acetobutylicum.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
