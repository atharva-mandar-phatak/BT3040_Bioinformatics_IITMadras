***********************
* DUSP domain profile *
***********************

Deubiquitinating enzymes  (DUB)  form a large family of cysteine protease that
can deconjugate  ubiquitin  or  ubiquitin-like proteins (see <PDOC00271>) from
ubiquitin-conjugated proteins.  All DUBs contain a catalytic domain surrounded
by one or more subdomains, some of which contribute to target recognition. The
~120-residue DUSP  (domain  present in ubiquitin-specific proteases) domain is
one of  these  specific  subdomains. Single or tandem DUSP domains are located
both N- and C-terminal  to the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase catalytic
core domain (see <PDOC00750>) [1].

The DUSP  domain displays a tripod-like AB3 fold with a three-helix bundle and
a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet ressembling the legs and seat of the
tripod (see  <PDB:1W6V>).  Conserved  residues  are  predominantly involved in
hydrophobic packing  interactions  within  the  three  alpha-helices. The most
conserved DUSP residues, forming the PGPI motif, are flanked by two long loops
that vary both in length and sequence. The PGPI motif packs against the three-
helix bundle and is highly ordered [1].

Some proteins known to contain a DUSP domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 4 (USP4) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Mammalian ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 11 (USP11) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Mammalian ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 15 (USP15) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Mammalian ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 20 (USP20) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Mammalian ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 32 (USP32) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Vertebrate ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 33 (USP33) (EC 3.1.2.15).
 - Vertebrate ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 48 (USP48) (EC 3.1.2.15).

The profile we developed covers the entire DUSP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
