* Mu homology domain (MHD) profile *
************************************

The mu  homology  domain  (MHD)  is  an ~280 residue module, which is found in
endocytotic proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis:

 - Mu subunits of adaptor protein (AP) complexes, AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4.
 - Proteins of the stonin family.

The MHD  domain  has  been  shown  to bind to the C2B domain of members of the
synaptotagmin family.  In  addition,  the mu2 subunit MHD domain also binds to
the tyrosine-based  motif  (Tyr-x-x-hydrophobic  residue) that marks many cell
surface for  endocytosis.  Residues  involved  in  this  interaction  are  not
conserved in  stonins,  which  are  not  able to bind tyrosine-based endocytic
signals [1,2,3].

The mu2  subunit  MHD  domain  has an elongated, banana-shaped, all beta-sheet
structure (see   <PDB:1BW8>).  It  can  be  considered  as  two  beta-sandwich
subdomains (A  and  B),  with subdomain B inserted between strands 6 and 15 of
subdomain A,  and  joined  edge  to  edge  such  that  the convex surface is a
continuous nine-stranded  mixed  beta-sheet  that runs the whole length of the
molecule. The  tyrosine  based  signal  binds  to a site on the surface of two
parallel beta-sheet strands (beta1 and beta16) in subdomain A [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire MHD domain.
