* PET domain profile *
**********************

The PET domain is a ~110 amino acid motif in the N-terminal part of LIM domain
proteins.  The  domain  was  described in Drosophila proteins involved in cell
differentiation  and  is  named  after Prickle, Espinas and Testin. PET domain
proteins  contain  about  three zinc-binding LIM domains (see <PDOC00382>) and
are found among metazoans. The PET domain has been suggested to play a role in
protein-protein   interactions  with  proteins  involved  in  planar  polarity
signaling or organisation of the cytoskeleton [1].

Some proteins known to contain a PET domain:

 - Mammalian testin protein, which may function as a tumor suppressor.
 - Mammalian LIM domain only protein 6 (LMO6).
 - Fruit  fly prickle and espinas proteins encoded by the tissue polarity gene
   prickle (pk), involved in the control of orientation of bristles and hairs.
 - Mammalian prickle-like proteins 1 and 2.

The profile we developed covers the entire PET domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2007 / First entry.
