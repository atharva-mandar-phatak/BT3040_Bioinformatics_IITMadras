* Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK) domain profile *
***************************************************************

Phosphoinositides (PIs)  are  central  to  signal  transduction  and  membrane
trafficking in  all  eukaryotes.  They  are  derived from phosphatidylinositol
(PtdIns) as the result of phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 4
or 5  of the PtdIns head group. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs)
phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PtdInsP) to phosphatidylinositol
bisphosphate (PtdInsP2).  Three  types  of  PIPKs  are  present throughout the
eukaryotic kingdoms.  Type  I  (PtdIns4P  5-kinase)  and  type II (PtdIns5P 4-
kinase) generate  PtdIns(4,5)P2 from PtdIns4P and PtdIns5P, respectively. Type
III PIPK  (PtdIns3P  5-kinases)  are distinct from the type I and II PIPKs and
synthesize PtdIns(3,5)P2 [1,2,3].

The basic structure of PIPKs shared by animals, yeast and plant PIPks consists
of a  highly  conserved  central kinase domain and a dimerization domain. PIPK
domains have   high  sequence  identity,  well-defined  motifs  and  conserved
residues. They  consist  of  two  alpha+beta  subdomains (see <PDB:1BO1>]. The
larger N-terminal  subdomain contains a seven-stranded antiparallel beta sheet
and four   helices.   The   C-terminal   subdomain  contains  a  five-stranded
antiparallel beta sheet and four helices [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire PIPK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
