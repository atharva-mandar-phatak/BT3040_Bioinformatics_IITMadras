* R domain profile *
********************

Members of the TCP family of transcription factors have so far only been found
in plants,   where   they   are   implicated  in  processes  related  to  cell
proliferation. It  appears that TCP domain (see <PDOC51369>) protein have been
recruited during  evolution  to  control  cell  division and growth in various
developmental processes.  The  TCP  proteins  fall  into  two subfamilies, one
including CYC  and  TB1  and the other including the PCFs. Most members of the
CYC/TB1 subfamily  have  an R domain, predicted to form a coiled coil that may
mediate protein-protein interactions [1,2].

The R  domain  is  rich in polar residues (arginine, lysine and glutamic acid)
and is predicted to form a hydrophilic alpha-helix [1].

Some proteins known to contain a R domain are listed below:

 - Antirrhinum  majus cycloidea (CYC). It is involved in the control of floral
   symmetry, a character that has changed many times during plant evolution.
 - Maize  teosinte  branched  1 (TB1). It controls developmental switches that
   contributed to the evolution of maize from its wild ancestor teosinte.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana TCP2 and TCP3, which correlate with actively dividing
   regions of the floral meristem.

The profile we developed covers the entire R domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
