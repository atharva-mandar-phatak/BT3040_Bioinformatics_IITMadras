* Peptidase family C39 domain profile *
***************************************

ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
uses  the  hydrolysis  of ATP to energize diverse biological import and export
systems  (see  <PDOC00185>).  ABC transporters are constituted at least of two
conserved  regions:  a  highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less
conserved  transmembrane  domain (TMD) (see <PDOC00364>). These regions can be
found  on  the  same protein (mostly bacterial exporters and eukaryotes) or on
two  different  ones  (mostly bacterial importers) [1,2,3]. Nevertheless, in a
wide  range of ABC exporters, an additional protease domain of about 130 amino
acid  residues  is  found to be fused to the TMD and the NBD. This domain is a
maturation  protease for certain peptide bacteriocins, namely those containing
the  double  glycine  leader  motif.  These  include  class II bacteriocins of
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some of the lantibiotics,
the  CSPs  (competence  stimulating  peptide)  and  peptides  pheromones.  The
proteolytic domain  reside  in  the  N-terminal region of the protein. It is a
thiol peptidase and belongs to the C39 peptidase family [E1].

Thus all bacteriocin precursors containing double-glycine-type leader peptides
are processed and export concomitantly by a proteolytic domain residing in the
N-termini  of  their  dedicated  ABC transporter. It appears that this kind of
processing  is  more efficient [4,5]. It results in cleavage and translocation
of both peptides simultaneously, probably by processing the signal peptide and
exporting  the  resulting  mature  lantibiotic.  A  number of the proteins are
classified  as  non-peptidase  homologues  as  they  either  have  been  found
experimentally  to  be  without  peptidase  activity,  or  to  lack amino acid
residues  that  are  believed to be essential for the catalytic activity. Even
though  these  domains have lost their proteolytic properties they still serve
as substrate-recognition domains [6].

All  different  types  of  transporters containing an ABC peptidase domain are
listed   below  (references  are  only  provided  for  recently  characterized
proteins) [E2].

 - Lantibiotic exporter: hemolysin/bacteriocin (cylB).
 - Micrococin B17 exporter (mcbF).
 - Peptide-2 exporter: competence factor (comA/comB).
 - Protein-1 exporter: hemolysin (hlyB).
 - Protein-2 exporter: colicin V(cvaB).
 - Pediocin exporter (pedD).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.

-Note: The profile does not  recognize other ABC proteases involved in complex
 export, which seem  to be serine proteases.  These are  not fused to the TMD-
 NBD, and  seem  not  to  be  evolutionnary  related  to  this  kind  of fused
 proteases.
