* C-terminal cystine knot domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

The structures  of  transforming  growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta), nerve growth
factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and gonadotropin have been
shown to  be  similar  [1,2 and references therein]: these proteins are folded
into two  highly  twisted antiparallel pairs of beta-strands and contain three
disulfide bonds, of which two form a cystine ring through which the third bond
passes (see  the  schematic  representation  below).  This structure is called
cystine knot [3].

            +--<======b3======C---c------+
            |                 :   :      |
            +--==c====b4===>C-:-C-c-COOH |
                 :          : : :        |
            +--==c====b2===>C---C--------+
            |                 :
            +--<======b1======C--------------NH(2)

'=>': indicates the direction of the beta-strands 'b1' to 'b4'.
'C' : conserved cysteine in cystine knot.
'c' : additional conserved cysteine in C-terminal cystine knot.
':' : disulfide bridge.

Functional diverse modular proteins share a conserved domain of about 90 amino
acids in  their  C-terminal cysteine-rich region, that has been proposed [4,5]
to be  structurally  related  to  the  cystine-knot  family  [3]  and which is
therefore called  C-terminal  cystine-knot  (CTCK).  Members of the C-terminal
cystine knot family are listed below:

 - von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multifunctional protein which is involved in
   maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 vWF type D domains, 3 vWF type A
   domains, 3  vWF  type  B  domains, 2 vWF type C domains (see <PDOC00928>, a
   X domain and the C-terminal cystine knot.
 - Mucins.  Human  mucin  2, a highly polymorphic multidomain molecule with  a
   modular architecture  similar  to  vWF.  Xenopus mucin B.1 which contains a
   CCP domain, a vWF type C domain, a X domain and a CTCK. Other  mucins  that
   contain a  CTCK  are  the  human tracheobronchial mucin (gene MUC5), bovine
   submaxillary mucin-like protein, pig apomucin and rat intestinal mucin-like
   protein.
 - CCN  family  (cef-10/cyr61/CTFG/fisp-12/nov  protein family). These growth-
   factor inducible   proteins  are  structurally  related to the insulin-like
   growth factor binding proteins (see <PDOC00194>) and could also function as
   growth-factor binding proteins.
 - Drosophila slit protein which is essential for  development of midline glia
   and commissural axon pathways. It is composed of four leucine-rich repeats,
   seven EGF-like domains, a laminin G-like repeat and the CTCK.
 - Norrie disease protein (NDP) which may be involved in neuroectodermal cell-
   cell interaction   and   in   a   pathway   that   regulates   neural  cell
   differentiation and proliferation.
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
   lectin domain  (see  <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a
   CTCK.

The pattern  we  developed  for  CTCK correspond to the C-terminal half of the
domain.
