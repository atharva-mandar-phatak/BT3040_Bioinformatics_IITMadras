* recA family signature and profiles *
**************************************

The bacterial   recA   protein   [1,2,3,E1]   is   essential   for  homologous
recombination and   recombinational  repair  of  DNA  damage.  RecA  has  many
activities: it  filaments,  it  binds  to  single- and double-stranded DNA, it
binds and hydrolyzes ATP,  it is also a recombinase and, finally, it interacts
with lexA causing its activation and leading to its autocatalytic cleavage.

RecA is  a protein of about 350 amino-acid residues. Its sequence is very well
conserved [3,4,5,E1]    among  eubacterial  species.  It  is also found in the
chloroplast of plants [6].

The recA protein is closely related to:

 - Eukaryotic  RAD51  protein. Promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange
   on chromatin.
 - Eukaryotic DMC1 protein. Participates in meiotic recombination.
 - Prokaryotic  radA  protein.  Involved  in  DNA  repair  and  in  homologous
   recombination.
 - Bacteriophage  uvsX  gene product. Important  in genetic recombination, DNA
   repair, and replication.

As a  signature  pattern  specific  for  the  bacterial and chloroplastic recA
protein, we  selected  the best conserved region, a nonapeptide located in the
middle of the sequence and which is part of the monomer-monomer interface in a
recA filament.

We also  developed   two profiles. The first one covers the ATP binding domain
in the N-terminal part of  the  recA  protein. The  second  one span the whole
monomer-monomer  interface.  These  two profiles  also  pick up  the recA-like
proteins.
