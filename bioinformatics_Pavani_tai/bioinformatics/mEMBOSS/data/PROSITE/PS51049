* KASH domain profile *
***********************

The KASH  (for  Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1  homology)  or  KLS  domain is a highly
hydrophobic nuclear envelope localization domain of ~60 amino acids comprising
an ~20-amino-acid  transmembrane  region and a 30-35-residue C-terminal region
that lies  between  the inner and the outer nuclear membranes. The KASH domain
is found  in  association  with other domains, such as spectrin repeats and CH
(see <PDOC50021>),  at  the  C-terminus  of  proteins  tethered to the nuclear
membrane in diverse cell types [1,2,3,4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a KASH domain are listed below:

 - Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear anchorage protein 1 (ANC-1).
 - Drosophila  Klarsicht (Klar), a protein associated with nuclei and required
   for a subset of nuclear migrations.
 - Drosophila MSP-300.
 - Vetebrate  nesprin-1  and  -2  (also  known  as  Syne-1  and  -2). They are
   associated with  emerin and lamin A at the nuclear envelope of muscle cells
   and other cell types.

The profile we developed covers the entire KASH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
