* Eukaryotic cobalamin-binding proteins signature *
***************************************************

In eukaryotes, a number of proteins  are involved in the binding and transport
of cobalamin (vitamin B12) [1]. Some of them have been sequenced and have been
shown [2,3] to be evolutionary related and are listed below:

 - Intrinsic factor (IF).  The function of IF  is to promote the absorption of
   cobalamin in the ileum by specific receptor-mediated endocytosis.
 - Transcobalamin I (TC1)   (also called  R-binder  protein).  TC1  transports
   cobalamin from blood to cells.
 - Transcobalamin II (TC2). TC2 transports cobalamin from blood to cells.
 - Haptocorrin (cobalophilin). Haptocorrin binds to cobalamin and to cobalamin
   derivatives such as cobinamide.  It  may  play  a  role  in  preventing the
   absorption of cobalamin analogues produced by bacteria.

These glycoproteins are polypeptides of about 400  amino acids that share many
regions of  similarity. As a signature pattern, we selected a highly conserved
region in their central part.

-Consensus pattern: [SN]-[VT]-D-T-[GAME]-A-[LIVM]-[AV]-x-[LM]-A-[LIVMF]-[ST]-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
