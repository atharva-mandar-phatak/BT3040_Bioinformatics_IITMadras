* Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family signature *
**********************************************************

The short-chain  dehydrogenases/reductases  family  (SDR)  [1] is a very large
family of  enzymes,  most  of  which  are  known  to be NAD- or NADP-dependent
oxidoreductases. As  the  first  member of this family to be characterized was
Drosophila alcohol  dehydrogenase,  this  family  used  to  be  called [2,3,4]
'insect-type', or  'short-chain'  alcohol  dehydrogenases. Most member of this
family are  proteins  of  about  250  to 300 amino acid residues. The proteins
currently known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) from insects such as Drosophila.

   coli (gene fabG) and from plants.

   and Erwinia chrysanthemi (gene kduD).

We use as a signature  pattern  for  this  family of  proteins one of the best
conserved regions  which includes two perfectly conserved residues, a tyrosine
and a lysine. The tyrosine residue participates in the catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVSPADNK]-x(9)-{P}-x(2)-Y-[PSTAGNCV]-[STAGNQCIVM]-
                    [STAGC]-K-{PC}-[SAGFYR]-[LIVMSTAGD]-x-{K}-[LIVMFYW]-{D}-x-
                    {YR}-[LIVMFYWGAPTHQ]-[GSACQRHM]
                    [Y is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 18 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 35.
