* CAP-Gly domain signature and profile *
****************************************

It has been shown [1]  that  some cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAP) share
the presence  of a conserved, glycine-rich domain of about 42 residues, called
here CAP-Gly. Proteins known to contain this domain are listed below.

 - Restin (also known as cytoplasmic linker protein-170 or CLIP-170), a 160 Kd
   protein associated  with  intermediate  filaments  and that links endocytic
   vesicles to microtubules. Restin contains two copies of the CAP-Gly domain.
 - Vertebrate   dynactin  (150  Kd  dynein-associated  polypeptide;  DAP)  and
   Drosophila glued,  a  major  component  of  activator  I, a 20S polypeptide
   complex that stimulates dynein-mediated vesicle transport.
 - Yeast protein  BIK1  which seems  to  be  required  for  the  formation  or
   stabilization of  microtubules  during  mitosis  and  for spindle pole body
   fusion during conjugation.
 - Yeast protein NIP100 (NIP80).
 - Human  protein  CKAP1/TFCB,  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  protein  alp11 and
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F53F4.3. These proteins contain
   a N-terminal ubiquitin domain (see <PDOC00271>) and a C-terminal CAP-Gly
   domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein M01A8.2.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YNL148c.

Structurally, these  proteins  are made of three distinct parts: an N-terminal
section that  is  most  probably  globular  and contains the CAP-Gly domain, a
large central   region   predicted  to  be  in  an  alpha-helical  coiled-coil
conformation and, finally, a short C-terminal globular domain.

The signature for the CAP-Gly domain  corresponds  to the first 32 residues of
the domain and includes five of the six conserved glycines. A profile was also
developed that spans the complete CAP-Gly domain.
