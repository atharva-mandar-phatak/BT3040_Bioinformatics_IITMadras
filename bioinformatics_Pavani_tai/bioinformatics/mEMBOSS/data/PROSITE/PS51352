* Thioredoxin family active site signature and domain profile *
***************************************************************

Thioredoxins [1 to 4] are small proteins  of  approximately one hundred amino-
acid residues  which participate in various redox reactions via the reversible
oxidation of  an active center disulfide bond. They exist in either a  reduced
form or  an  oxidized  form  where  the two cysteine residues are linked in an
intramolecular disulfide  bond.  Thioredoxin  is  present  in  prokaryotes and
eukaryotes and   the  sequence  around the redox-active disulfide bond is well
conserved.  Bacteriophage T4    also encodes for a thioredoxin but its primary
structure is not homologous to bacterial, plant and vertebrate thioredoxins.

A  number  of  eukaryotic  proteins  contain  domains  evolutionary related to
thioredoxin,  most  of  them  are  protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). PDI (EC
5.3.4.1)  [5,6,7]  is  an  endoplasmic  reticulum  enzyme  that  catalyzes the
rearrangement of disulfide bonds in various proteins. The various forms of PDI
which are currently known are:

 - PDI major isozyme; a multifunctional protein that also function as the beta
   subunit of   prolyl   4-hydroxylase  (EC  1.14.11.2),  as  a  component  of
   oligosaccharyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.119), as thyroxine deiodinase (EC 3.8.
   1.4), as glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase (EC 1.8.4.2) and as a thyroid
   hormone-binding protein !
 - ERp60 (ER-60; 58 Kd microsomal protein). ERp60 was originally thought to be
   a phosphoinositide-specific  phospholipase  C  isozyme  and  later  to be a
   protease.
 - ERp72.
 - P5.

All PDI contains two or three (ERp72) copies of the thioredoxin domain.

Bacterial proteins  that  act  as  thiol:disulfide  interchange  proteins that
allows disulfide  bond  formation  in some periplasmic proteins also contain a
thioredoxin domain. These proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli dsbA (or prfA) and its orthologs in Vibrio cholerae (tcpG)
   and Haemophilus influenzae (por).
 - Escherichia  coli  dsbC (or xpRA) and its orthologs in Erwinia chrysanthemi
   and Haemophilus influenzae.
 - Escherichia coli dsbD (or dipZ) and its Haemophilus influenzae ortholog.
 - Escherichia  coli  dsbE  (or ccmG) and orthologs in Haemophilus influenzae,
   Rhodobacter capsulatus (helX), Rhiziobiacae (cycY and tlpA).

The  pattern  we developed is directed against the two cysteines that form the
redox-active bond. We also developed a profile that covers the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-[LIVMSTA]-x-[LIVMFYC]-[FYWSTHE]-x(2)-[FYWGTN]-C-
                    [GATPLVE]-[PHYWSTA]-C-{I}-x-{A}-x(3)-[LIVMFYWT]
                    [The 2 C's form the redox-active bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
 for Haemophilus influenzae dsbC, Escherichia coli dsbG and two others.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2007 / Profile added and text revised.
