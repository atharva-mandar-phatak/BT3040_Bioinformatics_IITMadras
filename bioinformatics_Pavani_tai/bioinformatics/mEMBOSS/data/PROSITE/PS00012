**************************************

Phosphopantetheine (or pantetheine 4' phosphate) is  the  prosthetic  group of
acyl carrier proteins (ACP) in some  multienzyme complexes  where it serves as
a 'swinging  arm'  for  the  attachment of activated fatty acid and amino-acid
groups [1].  Phosphopantetheine  is  attached  to  a  serine  residue in these
proteins [2].  ACP  proteins  or   domains  have  been found in various enzyme
systems which  are  listed  below  (references  are only provided for recently
determined sequences).

 - Fatty  acid  synthase  (FAS),  which  catalyzes the formation of long-chain
   fatty acids  from  acetyl-CoA,  malonyl-CoA  and NADPH. Bacterial and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   the  different  enzymatic  activities;  ACP  is  one of these polypeptides.
   Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the ACP
   domain is  located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of  FAS2.  Vertebrate FAS
   consists of a single  multifunctional  enzyme;  the ACP  domain  is located
   between the beta-ketoacyl reductase  domain and the C-terminal thioesterase
   domain [3].
 - Polyketide antibiotics  synthase enzyme systems.  Polyketides are secondary
   metabolites produced from simple fatty acids, by microorganisms and plants.
   ACP is one of the polypeptidic  components  involved in the biosynthesis of
   Streptomyces polyketide  antibiotics  actinorhodin,  curamycin, granatacin,
   monensin, oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin C.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  putative polyketide synthases pksK, pksL and pksM which
   respectively contain three, five and one ACP domains.
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium
   patulum. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a
   polyketide antibiotic  and  which  contains an ACP domain in the C-terminal
   extremity.
 - Multifunctional  mycocerosic  acid  synthase  (gene mas) from Mycobacterium
   bovis.
 - Gramicidin  S  synthase  I  (gene  grsA)  from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme
   catalyzes the  first  step  in  the  biosynthesis  of the cyclic antibiotic
   gramicidin S.
 - Tyrocidine  synthase  I  (gene  tycA)  from  Bacillus  brevis. The reaction
   carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA.
 - Gramicidin S synthase II (gene grsB) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme is a
   multifunctional protein  that  activates  and  polymerizes proline, valine,
   ornithine and leucine. GrsB contains four ACP domains.
 - Erythronolide synthase proteins 1, 2 and 3 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea
   which is   involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  polyketide  antibiotic
   erythromicin. Each of these proteins contain two ACP domains.
 - Conidial green pigment synthase from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - ACV  synthase  from  various fungi. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in
   the biosynthesis  of  penicillin  and  cephalosporin. It contains three ACP
   domains.
 - Enterobactin  synthase  component F (gene entF) from Escherichia coli. This
   enzyme is  involved  in  the  ATP-dependent  activation  of  serine  during
   enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis.
 - Cyclic  peptide  antibiotic  surfactin  synthase  subunits  1, 2 and 3 from
   Bacillus subtilis.  Subunits  1  and 2 contains three related domains while
   subunit 3 only contains a single domain.
 - HC-toxin  synthase  (gene  HTS1)  from  Cochliobolus  carbonum. This enzyme
   synthesizes HC-toxin,   a  cyclic  tetrapeptide.  HTS1  contains  four  ACP
   domains.
 - Fungal  mitochondrial  ACP,  which  is  part  of the respiratory chain NADH
   dehydrogenase (complex I).
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodF,  which  probably  acts  as an ACP in the
   synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain.

The sequence around the phosphopantetheine attachment site is conserved in all
these proteins  and  can  be  used  as a signature pattern. A profile was also
developed that spans the complete ACP-like domain.

-Consensus pattern: [DEQGSTALMKRH]-[LIVMFYSTAC]-[GNQ]-[LIVMFYAG]-[DNEKHS]-S-

                    [LIVMWSTA]-[LIVGSTACR]-{LPIY}-{VY}-[LIVMFA]
                    [S is the pantetheine attachment site]
