* PINIT domain profile *
************************

The Siz/PIAS  RING  family  of  SUMO  E3  ligases  structure reveals a modular
architecture that  includes  an  N-terminal  PINIT  domain,  a central SP-RING
domain (see  <PDOC51044>),  and  a  unique  C-terminal domain (SP-CTD). The N-
terminal PINIT  domain is formed by two antiparallel beta sheets; one includes
beta1, beta2,  beta4,  and  beta9,  and  the  other includes beta3, beta5, and
beta8 (see  <PDB:3I2D;  A>). The beta sheets are connected by protruding loops
(L1, L2, and L3) that join strands beta2-3, beta4-5, and beta8-9 at one end of
the molecule,  while  beta3-4  and beta5-8 are connected by alpha helix alpha1
and a loop, respectively, on the opposite surface [1].

Most E3  ligases  achieve  substrate  specificity  by recruiting the E2~Ub/Ubl
thioester and  substrate  into  a  complex  to  promote conjugation. The PINIT
domain serves  as a scaffold to coordinate PCNA to promote SUMO conjugation to
both consensus and nonconsensus lysine side chains [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire PINIT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
