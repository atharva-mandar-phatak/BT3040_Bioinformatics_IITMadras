* GCM domain profile *
**********************

The GCM  domain  is  an  around  150  amino  acid residue region that has been
identified in  the  N-terminal  part of glial cell missing (GCM) transcription
factors, which  form  a  small  family  of metazoan transcriptional regulators
involved in  fundamental developmental processes. The GCM motif has been shown
to be  a  DNA-binding domain that recognizes preferentially the nonpalindromic
octamer 5'-ATGCGGGT-3' [1,2,3,4,5].

The GCM  motif  contains  many  conserved  basic  amino  acid  residues, seven
cysteine residues,  and  four  histidine residues [1]. The conserved cysteines
are involved in shaping the overall conformation of the domain, in the process
of DNA  binding and in the redox regulation of DNA binding [3]. The GCM domain
contains two  tetrahedrally  coordinated  zinc  ions.  The  resolution  of the
crystal structure  of  GCMa  has shown that the GCM domain consists of a large
and small  domain tethered together by one of the two zinc ions present in the
structure (see <PDB:1ODH>). The large and the small domains comprise five- and
three-stranded beta-sheets,  respectively,  with  three small helical segments
packed against  the same side of the two beta-sheets. The GCM domain exercises
a novel  mode  of  sequence-specific  DNA recognition, where the five-stranded
beta-pleated sheet  inserts  into  the  major  groove  of  the  DNA.  Residues
protruding from  the  edge  strand of the beta-pleated sheet and the following
loop and  strand contact the bases and backbone of both DNA strands, providing
specificity for its DNA target site [5].

Proteins known to contain a GCM motif are listed below:

 - Drosophila  glial  cell missing (GCM) protein. It functions as an important
   switch during early neurogenesis by committing cells to the glial cell fate
   [1,2].
 - Mammalian   GCMa   (or  GCM1)  protein.  GCMa  is  primarily  expressed  in
   trophoblasts of  the placenta and is possibly involved in the expression of
   multiple placenta-specific genes [4,6].
 - Mammalian  GCMb  (or  GCM2)  protein.  The function of this protein that is
   selectively detected in the forming parathyroid gland is not yet known [4].

The profile covers the entire GCM motif.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the repeat profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
