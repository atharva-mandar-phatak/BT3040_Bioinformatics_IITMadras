* FCH domain profile *
**********************

The  FCH  domain  is  a  short conserved region of around 60 amino acids first
described  as  a  region  of  homology between FER and CIP4 proteins [1]. Many
proteins   containing  an  FCH  domain  are  involved  in  the  regulation  of
cytoskeletal  rearrangements, vesicular transport and endocytosis. In the CIP4
protein  the  FCH  domain  binds to microtubules [2]. The FCH domain is always
found N-terminally and is followed by a coiled-coil region.

Proteins containing an FCH domain can be divided in 3 classes [3]:

A subfamily of protein kinases usually associated with an SH2 domain:

 - Fps/fes (Fujimani poultry sarcoma/feline sarcoma) proto-oncogenes. They are
   non-receptor  protein-tyrosine  kinases preferentially expressed in myeloid
   lineage.  The  viral  oncogene  has  an  unregulated kinase activity  which
   abrogates   the   need   for  cytokines  and  influences differentiation of
   haematopoietic progenitor cells.
 - Fes related protein (fer). It is an ubiquitously expressed homolog of Fes.

Adaptor proteins usually associated with a C-terminal SH3 domain:

 - Schizosaccharomyces   pombe   CDC15   protein.  It   mediates  cytoskeletal
   rearrangements required for cytokinesis. It is essential for viability.
 - CD2 cytoplasmic domain binding protein.
 - Mammalian  Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4). It may act as a link between
   Cdc42 signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
 - Mammalian  PACSIN proteins. A family of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins playing
   a role in vesicle formation and transport.

A subfamily of Rho-GAP proteins:

 - Mammalian  RhoGAP4   proteins. They  may down-regulate Rho-like  GTPases in
   hematopoietic cells.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR260C.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK669.1.

The profile we developed covers the entire FCH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
