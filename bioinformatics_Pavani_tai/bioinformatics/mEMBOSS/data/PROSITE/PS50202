* Major sperm protein (MSP) domain profile *
********************************************

Nematode sperm  are  unusual  amoeboid cells in which motility is not based on
actin, but instead on the major sperm protein (MSP) that polymerizes to form a
cytoskeleton constructed from intermeshed filaments. MSP is a dimeric molecule
that polymerizes  to  form  non-polar  filaments  constructed from two helical
subfilaments that  wind  round  one  another. The filaments then assemble into
larger macromolecular  assemblies  called fibre complexes. MSP is a small (~14
kDa) basic  protein  typically  encoded  by  a  multigene  family  of up to 28
members [1,2,3,4].  An  about  120-amino  acid  domain similar to MSP has been
found in the following proteins:

 - Animal  Vesicle-Associated  Membrane  Protein-associated  (VAMP-associated)
   protein family  of  33  kDa (VAP33). VAP33 is required for neurotransmitter
   release. It  binds  to  the  v-SNARE synaptobrevin/VAMP which is associated
   with vesicle  fusion.  VAP33 has a two-domain structure with its N-terminus
   being highly  homologous  to  MSP,  whereas  its  C-terminus  is based on a
   putative alpha-helical  coiled-coil  combined  with an extremly hydrophobic
   membrane-attachment region [5].
 - Nicotiana  plumbaginifolia  VAP27, a VAP33 homologue. It interacts with the
   resistance protein Cf9 [6].
 - Yeast  inositol  regulator  SCS2,  a  VAP33  homologue.  It is C-terminally
   anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum [7].

The MSP  polypeptide  chain  has an immunoglobulin-like fold based on a seven-
stranded beta  sandwich  measuring approximately 15 A x 20 A x 45 A and having
opposing three-stranded and four-stranded beta sheets (see <PDB:1MSP>) [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire MSP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
