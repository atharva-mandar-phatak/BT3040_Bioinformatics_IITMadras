* Histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain profile *
*************************************************************

Most prokaryotic signal-transduction systems and a few eukaryotic pathways use
phosphotransfer schemes   involving  two  conserved  components,  a  histidine
protein kinase  (HK)  (see  <PDOC50109>) and a response regulator protein (RR)
(see <PDOC50110>).  The  HK,  which  is  regulated  by  environmental stimuli,
autophosphorylates at  a  histidine residue, creating a high-energy phosphoryl
group that  is  subsequently  transferred  to  an  aspartate residue in the RR
domain. Phosphorylation  induces a conformational change in RR that results in
activation of an associated domain that effects the response [1].

Besides these  two  signaling domains, a small number of two-component systems
contain another  common  signaling  domain,  termed  the  Histidine-containing
Phosphotransfer (HPt) domain.  A large majority of prokaryotic HPt domains are
part of  multi-domain  sensor kinases, whereas in eukaryotes they are found in
separate independent  proteins. HPt domains are ~120 amino acids in length and
contain a  histidine  residue  capable of participating in phosphoryl transfer
reactions. They  serve a dual purpose as a phosphoreceiver and phosphodonor in
order to  shuttle  phosphoryl  groups  between  two or more response regulator
domains. The presence of HPt domains and use of multistep phosphorelay systems
provide for additional points of regulation of signaling pathway [1].

The resolution  of  the  3D  structure  of some HPt domains revealed that they
have a kidney shape and an all-alpha structure (see <PDB:1A0B>). Despite their
overall low  sequence homology and length variability, all of the HPts share a
common up-down-up-down  four-helix  bundle  core  with  the  site of histidine
phosphorylation located  at  the  same  position on the second helix. The most
conserved positions  are  the  phosphorylation  site  defined by the histidine
followed by  several  highly  conserved  residues  and a number of hydrophobic
residues which  seem  to  play a role in the formation of the hydrophobic core
that allows association of the four-helix bundle [2,3,4,5].

The profile  we  developed covers the entire four-helix bundle core of the HPt
domain.
