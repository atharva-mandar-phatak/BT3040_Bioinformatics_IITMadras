* PFU domain profile *
**********************

The PFU  (for  PLAA  family  ubiquitin binding domain) is an ubiquitin binding
domain with no homology to several known ubiquitin binding domains (e.g., UIM,
NZF, UBA,  UEV,  UBP,  or CUE domains). The PFU domain appears to be unique to
the PLAA family of proteins. A single member of this family of proteins exists
in every  eukaryotic  species  examined.  Each  of  these homologues possesses
identical domain structure: an N-terminal domain containing seven WD40 repeats
(see <PDOC00574>),  a  central  PFU domain, and a C-terminal PUL domain, which
directly binds  to  Cdc48,  a  member  of  the  AAA-ATPase family of molecular
chaperone [1]. In addition to ubiquitin, the PFU domain of DOA1 has been shown
to bind to the SH3 domain (see <PDOC50002>) [2].

Secondary structure  predictions  of the PFU domain suggest the presence of an
extensive length of beta-sheet, N-terminal to an alpha-helical region [1].

Some proteins known to contain a PFU domain are listed below:

 - Saccharomyces   cerevisiae   DOA1   (UFD3,  ZZZ4),  involved  in  ubiquitin
   conjugation pathway.  DOA1  participates  in  the regulation of the ubiquin
   conjugation pathway  involving  CDC48  by  hindering multiubiquitination of
   substrates at the CDC48 chaperone.
 - Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  ubiquitin  homeostasis  protein lub1, acts as a
   negative regulator of vacuole-dependent ubiquitin degradation.
 - Mammalian phospholipase A-2-activating protein (PLA2P, PLAA), the homologue
   of DOA1.  PLA2P  plays  an  important  role  in  the regulation of specific
   inflammatory disease processes.

The profile we developed covers the entire PFU domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
