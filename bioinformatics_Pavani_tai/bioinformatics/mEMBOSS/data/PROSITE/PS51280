***********************************
* ABC transporter family profiles *
***********************************

ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
use the hydrolysis of ATP to energize diverse biological systems. It forms one
of  the  largest  of  all  protein  families with a diversity of physiological
functions  (see <PDOC00185>) [1,2]. Several studies have shown that there is a
correlation  between  the  functional  characterisation  and  the phylogenetic
classification  of  the  ABC  cassette  [2,4]. More than 50 families have been
described based on a phylogenetic and functional classification [2,3,4] [E1].

Some  ABC  transporter  families  on  which  we developed a profile are listed
below.

Active import transport system components:

 - Sulfate/thiosulfate import ATP-binding protein cysA (EC 3.6.3.25).
 - Phosphate import ATP-binding protein pstB (EC 3.6.3.27).
 - Molybdenum import ATP-binding protein modC (EC 3.6.3.29).
 - Ferric cations import ATP-binding protein fbpC (EC 3.6.3.30).
 - Maltose/maltodextrin import ATP-binding protein malK (EC 3.6.3.19).
 - Cobalt import ATP-binding protein cbiO.
 - Nickel import ATP-binding protein nikD/nikE (EC 3.6.3.24).
 - Phosphonates import ATP-binding protein phnC (EC 3.6.3.28).
 - Taurine import ATP-binding protein tauB (EC 3.6.3.36).
 - Ribose import ATP-binding protein rbsA (EC 3.6.3.17).
 - Galactose/methyl galactoside import ATP-binding protein mglA (EC 3.6.3.17).
 - Hemin import ATP-binding protein hmuV.
 - Methionine import ATP-binding protein metN.
 - Arabinose import ATP-binding protein araG (EC 3.6.3.17).
 - Xylose import ATP-binding protein xylG (EC 3.6.3.17).
 - Thiamine import ATP-binding protein thiQ.
 - Aliphatic sulfonate import ATP-binding protein ssuB.
 - Zinc import ATP-binding protein znuC.
 - Spermidine/putrescine import ATP-binding protein potA (EC 3.6.3.31).
 - sn-glycerol-3-phosphate import ATP-binding protein ugpC (EC 3.6.3.20).

Active export transport system components:

 - Lipid A export ATP-binding/permease protein msbA.
 - Nod factor export ATP-binding protein I.
 - Cytochrome c biogenesis ATP-binding export protein ccmA (EC 3.6.3.41).
 - Lipoprotein releasing system ATP-binding protein lolD.
 - Teichoic acids export ATP-binding protein tagH (EC 3.6.3.40).
 - Macrolide export ATP-binding/permease protein macB.
 - Beta-(1-->2)glucan export ATP-binding/permease protein ndvA (EC 3.6.3.42).

Each  family  profile  was  built on a discriminating region either in the ABC
cassette or in the C-terminal region.
