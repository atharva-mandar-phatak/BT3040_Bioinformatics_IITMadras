****************************************

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3 and EC 1.2.1.5)  are enzymes which oxidize
a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes.  In mammals at least  four
different forms  of  the enzyme are known [1]: class-1 (or Ald C) a tetrameric
cytosolic enzyme, class-2 (or Ald M) a tetrameric mitochondrial enzyme, class-
3 (or Ald D) a dimeric  cytosolic  enzyme,  and  class IV a microsomal enzyme.
Aldehyde  dehydrogenases  have  also  been sequenced from fungal and bacterial
species.  A number of enzymes are known to be evolutionary related to aldehyde
dehydrogenases; these enzymes are listed below.

 - Plants and bacterial  betaine-aldehyde  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.1.8) [2], an
   enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of betaine.
 - Plants     and    bacterial    NADP-dependent    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.9).
 - Escherichia coli succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.16)
   (gene gabD) [3], which reduces succinate semialdehyde into succinate.
 - Escherichia coli lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.22) (gene ald) [4].
 - Mammalian succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) (EC 1.2.1.24).
 - Escherichia coli phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.39).
 - Escherichia     coli     5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate     semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase (gene hpcC).
 - Pseudomonas putida 2-hydroxymuconic  semialdehyde  dehydrogenase [5] (genes
   dmpC and xylG), an enzyme in the meta-cleavage pathway for  the degradation
   of phenols, cresols and catechol.
 - Bacterial and  mammalian  methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH)
   (EC 1.2.1.27) [6],  an  enzyme  involved  in  the  distal pathway of valine
   catabolism.
 - Yeast delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12) [7] (gene
   PUT2), which converts proline to glutamate.
 - Bacterial multifunctional putA protein, which contains a delta-1-pyrroline-
   5-carboxylate dehydrogenase domain.
 - 26G,  a  garden  pea  protein  of  unknown  function  which  is  induced by
   dehydration of shoots [8].
 - Mammalian formyltetrahydrofolate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) [9]. This is a
   cytosolic enzyme   responsible  for   the  NADP-dependent   decarboxylative
   reduction of  10-formyltetrahydrofolate  into  tetrahydrofolate.  It  is an
   protein of about 900 amino  acids  which consist of three  domains;  the C-
   terminal domain (480 residues) is structurally and  functionally related to
   aldehyde dehydrogenases.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR006w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER073w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR039c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F01F1.6.

A glutamic acid and a cysteine residue  have  been implicated in the catalytic
activity of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase.  These residues are conserved in
all the enzymes of this family.  We have derived two patterns for this family,
one for each of the active site residues.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFGA]-E-[LIMSTAC]-[GS]-G-[KNLM]-[SADN]-[TAPFV]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 13 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 44.

-Consensus pattern: [FYLVA]-x-{GVEP}-{DILV}-G-[QE]-{LPYG}-C-[LIVMGSTANC]-
                    [AGCN]-{HE}-[GSTADNEKR]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 13 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 90.

-Note: Omega-crystallins are  minor structural components of squids and octopi
 eye lens. They are  evolutionary  related to aldehyde dehydrogenases but have
 lost their catalytic activity. These patterns will not detect them.
