* C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain profile *
****************************************

The C-CAP/cofactor  C-like  domain  is present in several cytoskeleton-related
proteins, which also contain a number of additional domains [1-4]:

 - Eukaryotic   cyclase-associated  protein (CAP or SRV2) (see <PDOC00835>), a
   modular actin monomer binding that directly regulates filament dynamics and
   has been  implicated in a number of complex developmental and morphological
   processes, including  mRNA  localization  and  the  establishment  of  cell
   polarity.
 - Vertebrate retinitis pigmentosa 2 (XRP2). In human, the protein responsible
   for X-linked  forms  of  retinitis  pigmentosa,  a disease characterized by
   severe retinal degeneration.
 - Eukaryotic   tubulin-specific   chaperone  cofactor  C  (TBCC),  a  GTPase-
   activating component of the tubulin-folding supercomplex, which directs the
   assembly of the alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimer.

The cyclase-associated  protein C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain binds G-actin and
is responsible for oligomerization of the entire CAP molecule [1], whereas the
XRP2 C-CAP/cofactor  C-like domain is required for binding of ADP ribosylation
factor-like protein 3 (Arl3) [2].

The central  core of the C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain is composed of six coils
of right-handed   parallel   beta-helix,  termed  coils  1-6,  which  form  an
elliptical barrel  with  a  tightly packed interior. Each beta-helical coil is
composed of  three relatively short beta-strands, designated a-c, separated by
sharp turns.  Flanking  the  central  beta-helical core is an N-terminal beta-
strand, beta0,  that  packs  antiparallel  to the core, and strand beta7 packs
antiparallel to  the  core  near the C-terminal end of the parallel beta-helix
(see <PDB:1K4Z>) [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
