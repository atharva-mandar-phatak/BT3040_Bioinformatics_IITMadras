* Oxysterol-binding protein family signature *
**********************************************

A number of eukaryotic proteins that seem to be involved with sterol synthesis
and/or its regulation have been found [1] to be evolutionary related:

 - Mammalian  oxysterol-binding  protein (OSBP). A protein of about 800 amino-
   acid residues that binds a variety of oxysterols: oxygenated derivatives of
   cholesterol. OSBP seems to play a complex role in the  regulation of sterol
   metabolism.
 - Mammalian OSBP-related proteins 1 to 11.
 - Yeast proteins HES1 and KES1; highly related proteins of  434 residues that
   seem to play a role in ergosterol synthesis.
 - Yeast OSH1 to OSH7.

All these proteins contain a moderately conserved domain of about 250 residues
located in  the  C-terminal  half of OBSP, OSH1 and YHR073w and in the central
section of  the  other  proteins. As a signature pattern, we selected the best
conserved part   of   this   domain,   a  region  that  contains  a  conserved
pentapeptide.

-Consensus pattern: E-[KQ]-x-[SC]-H-[HR]-[PG]-[PL]-x(1,2)-[STACFI]-[ACGY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
