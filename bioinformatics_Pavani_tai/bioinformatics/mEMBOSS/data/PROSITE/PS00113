* Adenylate kinase signature *
******************************

Adenylate kinase  (EC 2.7.4.3) (AK) [1]  is  a  small  monomeric  enzyme  that
catalyzes the reversible transfer of MgATP to AMP (MgATP + AMP = MgADP + ADP).
In mammals there are three different isozymes:

 - AK1 (or myokinase), which is cytosolic.
 - AK2, which is located in the outer compartment of mitochondria.
 - AK3 (or GTP:AMP phosphotransferase),  which is located in the mitochondrial
   matrix and which uses MgGTP instead of MgATP.

The sequence of  AK has also  been  obtained from different  bacterial species
and from plants and fungi.

Two other enzymes have been found to be evolutionary related to AK. These are:

 - Yeast uridylate kinase  (EC 2.7.4.-) (UK)  (gene URA6) [2]  which catalyzes
   the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to UMP to form UDP and ADP.
 - Slime mold UMP-CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14) [3] which catalyzes the transfer of
   a phosphate group from ATP to either CMP or UMP to form CDP or UDP and ADP.

Several regions of  AK  family enzymes  are well conserved, including the ATP-
binding domains.  We have  selected the  most conserved  of  all  regions as a
signature for this type  of  enzyme.   This  region includes  an aspartic acid
residue that is  part of the  catalytic  cleft  of  the  enzyme  and  that  is
involved in  a salt  bridge.    It  also  includes an  arginine  residue whose
modification leads to inactivation of the enzyme.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYWCA]-[LIVMFYW](2)-D-G-[FYI]-P-R-x(3)-[NQ]
                    [The R is an active site residue]
                    [The D is involved in a salt bridge]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Schistosoma mansoni (blood fluke) and Yersinia enterocolitica AK.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Archaebacterial AK do not belong to this family [4].
