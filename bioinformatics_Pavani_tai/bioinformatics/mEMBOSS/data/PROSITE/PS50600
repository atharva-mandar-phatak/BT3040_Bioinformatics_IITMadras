* Ubiquitin-like protease family profile *
******************************************

Deubiquitinating  enzymes  (DUB) form a large family of cysteine protease that
can deconjugate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from ubiquitin-conjugated
proteins.  They can be classified in 3 families according to sequence homology
[1,2]:   ubiquitin   carboxyl-terminal   hydrolases (UCH)  (see  <PDOC00127>),
ubiquitin-specific   processing   proteases  (UBP)   (see   <PDOC00750>),  and
ubiquitin-like proteases  (ULP)  (EC  3.4.22.68)  specific  for  deconjugating
ubiquitin-like proteins.  In  contrast  to  the  UBP  pathway,  which  is very
redundant (16  UBP  enzymes  in  yeast),  there is few ubiquitin-like protease
(only one in yeast, ULP1).

ULP1  catalyses  two  critical  functions  in  the  SUMO/Smt3  pathway via its
cysteine  protease  activity.  ULP1  processes  the  Smt3  C-terminal sequence
(-GGATY)  to  its  mature form (-GG), and it deconjugates Smt3 from the lysine
epsilon-amino group of the target protein [3].

Crystal  structure of yeast ULP1 bound to Smt3 [4] revealed that the catalytic
and  interaction  interface  is  situated  in a shallow and narrow cleft where
conserved  residues recognize the Gly-Gly motif at the C-terminal extremity of
Smt3  protein.  Ulp1  adopts  a  novel  architecture  despite  some structural
similarity  with  other cysteine protease. The secondary structure is composed
of  seven  alpha helices and seven beta strands. The catalytic domain includes
the  central  alpha  helix,  beta-strands  4  to  6,  and  the catalytic triad
(Cys-His-Asp) (see <PDB:1EUV>).

We  developed  a  profile directed against the C-terminal part of ULP proteins
that displays full proteolytic activity [4].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family C48 in the classification of peptidases
 [E1].
