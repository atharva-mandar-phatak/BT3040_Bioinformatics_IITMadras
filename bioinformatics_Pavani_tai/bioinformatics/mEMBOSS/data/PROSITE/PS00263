* Natriuretic peptides signature *
**********************************

Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) [1,2,3] are vertebrate hormones important in
the overall control of cardiovascular homeostasis and sodium and water balance
in general.  There  are  various ANP  peptides which  vary in length but which
have a common central  core;  they  are all processed from a single precursor.
There is  a    disulfide  bond    which is important for the expression of the
biological activity.

The ANP protein family includes three additional structurally related peptides
which elicit a pharmacological spectrum similar to ANP:

 - Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
 - C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).
 - Ventricular natriuretic peptide (VNP) [4].
 - Green mamba natriuretic peptide (DNP) [5].

The signature developed for the ANP family includes the two cysteines involved
in the disulfide  bond and two conserved  glycines  which may be important for
the conformation of the peptides.

-Consensus pattern: C-F-G-x(3)-[DEA]-[RH]-I-x(3)-S-x(2)-G-C
                    [The 2 C's are linked by a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
