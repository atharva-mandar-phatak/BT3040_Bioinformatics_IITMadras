* PTN/MK heparin-binding protein family signatures *
****************************************************

The following extracellular heparin-binding proteins involved in regulation of
growth and differentiation belong to a new family of growth factors:

 - Pleiotrophin (PTN) [1]. Also  known as  heparin-binding   growth-associated
   molecule (HB-GAM),   heparin-binding  growth  factor  8  (HBGF-8), heparin-
   binding neutrophic  factor) (HBNF) and osteoblast specific protein (OSF-1).
   This factor has neurite extension activity.
 - Midkine (MK) [2], a retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor.
 - Retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein (RI-HB) [3] from chicken. RI-
   has mitogenic activity and neurite extension activity for PC12 cells. RI-HB
   is possibly the chicken homolog of mammalian MK.
 - Pleiotrophic  factors  alpha-1 and -2 and beta-1 and -2 from Xenopus laevis
   [4], the homologs of respectively midkine and pleiotrophin.

These growth factors are highly related proteins of about 140 amino acids that
contain 10  conserved  cysteines  probably  involved in disulfide bonds (their
position is schematically represented in the figure below). These proteins are
also rich in basic residues and in tryptophan.

'*': position of the patterns.

We developed  two signature  patterns for  this  family of growth  factors. As
shown in the figure  above, the patterns include the majority of the conserved
cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: S-[DE]-C-x-[DE]-W-x-W-x(2)-C-x-P-x-[SN]-x-D-C-G-[LIVMA]-G-
                    x-R-E-G
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: C-[KR]-[LIVM]-P-C-N-W-K-K-x-F-G-A-[DE]-C-K-Y-x-F-[EQ]-x-W-
                    G-x-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
