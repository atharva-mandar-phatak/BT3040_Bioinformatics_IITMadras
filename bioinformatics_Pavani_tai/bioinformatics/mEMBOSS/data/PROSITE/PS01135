* FtsZ protein signatures *
***************************

In bacteria,  ftsZ   [1,2] is  an  essential cell division protein involved in
cytokinesis. It assembles into a ring on the inner surface  of the cytoplasmic
membrane at the place where division will occur. The ring serves as a scaffold
that is  disassembled  when  septation  is  completed.  FtsZ  is a GTP binding
protein with a GTPase activity. It undergoes GTP-dependent polymerization into
filaments (or  tubules)  that  seem  to form a cytoskeleton involved in septum
synthesis.

FtsZ is  a  protein  of  about  400  residues  which  is well conserved across
bacterial species  and  which is also present in the chloroplast of plants [3]
as well  as  in archaebacteria  [4].  FtsZ  shows  a  limited  similarity with
eukaryotic tubulins.   This  similarity  is  probably  both  evolutionary  and
functionally significant.

As signature  patterns  we  selected  two  glycine-rich conserved regions. The
second region  is  equivalent  to  the  GTP-binding  region  of  tubulins (see
<PDOC00199>).
