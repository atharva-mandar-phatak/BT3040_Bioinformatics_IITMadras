* COMM domain profile *
***********************

COMM (copper  metabolism  gene  MURR1)  domain  proteins  constitute  a family
initially identified  as  interacting  partners of COMMD1 (previously known as
MURR1), the   prototype   member   of   this   protein  family.  COMMD1  is  a
multifunctional protein  that  has been shown to participate in two apparently
distinct activities,  regulation of  the  transcription  factor NF-kappa-B and
control of  copper  metabolism.  The family is defined by the presence of a C-
terminal motif  termed  COMM  domain,  which  functions  as  an  interface for
protein-protein interactions.  The proteins designated as COMMD or COMM domain
containing 1-10   are   extensively   conserved  in  multicellular  eukaryotic
organisms [1,2].

The leucine-rich,  70-85  amino  acid  long COMM domain is predicted to form a
beta-sheet [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire COMM domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
