* SGS domain profile *
**********************

The SGT1-specific  (SGS)  domain  is  a  module  of ~90 amino acids, which was
initially identified in eukaryotic SGT1 proteins [1]. It was latter also found
in calcyclin-binding  proteins  [2].  The SGS domain has been shown to bind to
proteins of  the  S100  family,  which  are  thought to function as sensors of
calcium ion concentration in the cell [2].

Some proteins known to contain a SGS domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  suppressor  of the G2 allele of skp1 (SGT1). It is required for cell
   cycle progression   at   the  G1/S-phase  and  G2/M-phase  transitions.  It
   associates with  Skp1  and regulates its function in the Skp1/Cullin1/F-box
   complex ubiquitin ligase and in kinetochore complexes.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana SGT1a and SGT1b.
 - Mammalian SGT1.
 - Mammalian      calcyclin-binding     protein/Siah-1-interacting     protein
   (CacyBP/SIP), a    component   of   a   novel   pathway   of   beta-catenin
   ubiquitination.

The profile we developed covers the entire SGS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
