* Ras-binding domain (RBD) profile *
************************************

Ras and  heterotrimeric  G  proteins'  alpha  subunits  are signal-transducing
GTPases that  cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. The
activities of these GTPases are regulated in part by GTPase-activating protein
(GAPs) that  stimulate  hydrolysis  of  GTP,  and  guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs)  that  stimulate  GDP  release.  Ras  and  G  alpha GTPases are
prolific signalling   molecules   interacting  with  a  spectrum  of  effector
molecules and acting through more than one signalling pathway. The Ras-binding
domain (RBD)  is  an  independent  domain  of  about  75  residues,  which  is
sufficient for GTP-dependent binding of Ras and other G alpha GTPases. The RBD
domain can  be present singly or in tandem and it can be found associated with
many other  domains, such as PDZ (see <PDOC50106>), RGS (see <PDOC50132>), PID
(see <PDOC00907>),  PH  (see  <PDOC50003>),  C1  (see  <PDOC00379>),  DH  (see
<PDOC00605>), or protein kinase (see <PDOC00100>) [1].

Structurally, the  RBD domain of Raf-1 consists of a five-stranded mixed beta-
sheet with  an  interrupted alpha-helix and two additional small alpha-helices
(see <PDB:1GUA>).  The  structure  of  the RBD domain belongs to the ubiquitin
alpha/beta roll  superfold  and  is  similar  to  that  of  the RA domain (see
<PDOC50200>) despite  the  lack  of  significant  sequence identity. The major
interaction between  Ras  and Raf-1 RBD domain occurs between two antiparallel
beta-strands: beta 2 of Ras and beta 2 of RBD [2].

Some proteins known to contain a RBD domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase.
 - Mammalian regulator of G-protein signalling 12 (RGS12) and 14 (RGS14).
 - Mammalian  T-lymphoma  invasion and  metastasis inducing protein 1 (TIAM1).
   TIAM1 modulates    the    activity    of    Rho-like  proteins and connects
   extracellular signals to cytoskeletal activities.
 - Mouse Sif and Tiam1-like exchange factor (STEF).
 - Drosophila  LOCO-c1  and  LOCO-c2,  two  proteins  required  for glial cell
   differentiation.
 - Drosophila  Still  life proteins (SIF) type 1 and 2. They regulate synaptic
   differentiation through  the organization of actin cytoskeleton possibly by
   activating Rho-like GTPases.

The profile we developed covers the entire RBD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
