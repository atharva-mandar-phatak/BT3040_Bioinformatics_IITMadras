* Bacterial ring hydroxylating dioxygenases alpha-subunit signature *
*********************************************************************

Bacterial  ring  hydroxylating  dioxygenases   are   multicomponent  enzymatic
complexes  composed  of a  hydroxylase  component  and  an  electron  transfer
component. The hydroxylase component is  itself  composed  of two subunits: an
alpha-subunit of about 50 Kd, and a beta-subunit of about 20 Kd.  The electron
transfer component  is  either  composed of two subunits:  a  ferredoxin and a
ferredoxin reductase or by a single bifunctional ferredoxin/reductase subunit.

The alpha-subunit of hydroxylase components are evolutionary related [1].  The
currently known members of this family are listed below.

 - Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.3) (gene bnzA) from Pseudomonas putida.
 - phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.7) (gene pht3) from Pseudomonas.
 - Benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.10)  (gene benA)  from  Acinetobacter
   calcoaceticus.
 - Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.12) (gene ndoC) from Pseudomonas.
 - 3-chlorobenzoate-3,4-dioxygenase   (EC   1.14.12-.-)   (gene   cbaA)   from
   Alcaligenes.
 - Biphenyl dioxygenase (EC 1.14.99.-) (gene bphA) from Pseudomonas.
 - Toluate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.-) (gene xylX) from Pseudomonas putida.
 - Toluene 2,3-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.-)   (gene todC1)   from   Pseudomonas
   putida.

The alpha-subunit of the hydroxylase components bind  both a 2Fe-2S type iron-
sulfur center and an iron atom.  There is,  in the N-terminal section of these
proteins, a conserved  region  of 24 residues which contains two cysteines and
two histidines  which have been shown [2] to be involved in the binding of the
iron-sulfur center. We have used this region has a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-H-R-[GAR]-x(7,8)-[GEKVI]-[NERAQ]-x(4,5)-C-x-[FY]-H
                    [The 2 C's and the 2 H's are 2Fe-2S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
