* Spondin domain profile *
**************************

The spondin  domain  is  a  ~200  amino  acid  module containing two conserved
motifs, FS1  and  FS2,  that  is  shared by the vertebrate and invertebrate F-
spondin family of proteins, which includes both F-spondin and M-spondin/Mindin
(renamed Spon1  and  Spon2  respectively).  The  spondin  domain  is  found in
association with  other  modules,  such  as  the  thrombospondin type I repeat
(TSP1) (see <PDOC50092>), the reelin domain (see <PDOC51019>), the fibronectin
type III  domain  (see  <PDOC50853>)  or the Kunitz trypsin protease inhibitor
domain (see  <PDOC00252>). The function of the spondin domain is not known but
it might interact with other factors [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire spondin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
