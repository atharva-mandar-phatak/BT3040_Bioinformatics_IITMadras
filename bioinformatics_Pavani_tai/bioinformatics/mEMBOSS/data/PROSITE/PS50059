*********************************************************

FKBP [1,2,3]  is  the major high-affinity binding protein, in vertebrates, for
the immunosuppressive    drug  FK506.  It  exhibits  peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase activity (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase is an enzyme that
accelerates protein  folding  by  catalyzing  the   cis-trans isomerization of
proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides [4].

At least three different forms of FKBP are known in mammalian species:

 - FKBP-12, which is cytosolic and inhibited by both FK506 and rapamycin.
 - FKBP-13,  which  is  membrane  associated  and  inhibited by both FK506 and
   rapamycin.
 - FKBP-25, which is preferentially inhibited by rapamycin.

These forms  of  FKBP are evolutionary related and show extensive similarities
[5,6,7] with the following proteins:

 - Fungal FKBP.
 - Mammalian  hsp  binding  immunophilin  (HBI)  (also  called  p59). HBI is a
   protein which  binds  to hsp90 and contains two FKBP-like domains in its N-
   terminal section - the first of which seems to be functional.
 - The C-terminal  part  of  the  cell-surface  protein  mip  from Legionella;
   a protein associated with macrophage infection by an unknown mechanism.
 - Escherichia coli slyD [8], a protein with a N-terminal FKBP domain followed
   by an histidine-rich metal-binding domain.
 - Escherichia coli fkpA.
 - Escherichia coli fklB (FKBP22).
 - Escherichia coli slpA.
 - Bacterial trigger factor (Tig).
 - Streptomyces hygroscopus and chrysomallus FK506-binding protein.
 - Chlamydia trachomatis 27 Kd membrane protein.
 - Neisseria meningitidis strain C114 PPiase.
 - Probable    PPiases  from  Haemophilus  influenzae  (HI0754), Methanococcus
   jannaschii (MJ0278  and  MJ0825),  Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonase
   aeruginosa.

We developed a profile for FKBP that spans the complete domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Cyclophilin, the  protein  that  binds to  the  immunosuppressive  drug
 cyclosporin A, is also a PPIase but  its sequence is not  at  all  related to
 that of FKBP (see <PDOC00154>).
