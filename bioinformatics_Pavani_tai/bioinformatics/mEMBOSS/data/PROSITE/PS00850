* Glycine radical domain signature and profile *
************************************************

Protein radicals  are  components of several biologically important reactions.
Glycyl radical  enzymes  are  involved  in  a  great variety of functions, for
example, nucleotide,  pyruvate  and  toluene metabolism [1]. These enzymes are
posttranslationally interconverted,   under   anaerobic  conditions,  from  an
inactive to  an  active  form  that  carries  a  stable radical localized to a
specific glycine  at  the C-terminal region of the polypeptidic chain. Extreme
sensitivity towards  destruction  by  oxygen,  leading to polypeptide cleavage
between the N-Calpha bond of the Gly residue, is a conspicuous property of all
protein-based glycyl radicals, thus confining their existence to strictly
anaerobic conditions.

Some proteins known to contain a glycyl radical are listed below:

 - Escherichia  coli  pyruvate  formate-lyase  (EC 2.3.1.54) (genes pflB, pflD
   and pflF),  a  key  enzyme  of  anaerobic  glucose  metabolism, it converts
   pyruvate and CoA into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate [2].
 - Escherichia  coli  (gene  nrdD)  and  bacteriophage  T4 (gene nrdD or sunY)
   anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.2) [3,4].
 - Escherichia  coli  and  bacteriophage T4 autonomous glycyl radical cofactor
   (gene grcA) [5].

These proteins share a conserved region  centered around the glycine which, in
pfl, is  known to  bear the free radical.  We  use this region has a signature
pattern. We  also  developed a profile which covers the entire glycine radical
domain.

-Consensus pattern: [STIV]-x-R-[IVT]-[CSA]-G-Y-{GI}-[GACV]
                    [G carries the radical]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
