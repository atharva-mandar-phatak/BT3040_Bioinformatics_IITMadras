* FAS1/BIgH3 domain profile *
*****************************

The  FAS1  or  BIgH3 domain is an extracellular module of about 140 amino acid
residues.  It  has  been  suggested that the FAS1 domain represents an ancient
cell  adhesion  domain  common to plants and animals [1]; related FAS1 domains
are  also  found in bacteria [2]. Most FAS1 domain containing proteins are GPI
anchored  and  contain two or four copies of the domain. FAS1 domains of BIgH3
protein  mediate  cell  adhesion  throught  an  interaction  with alpha3/beta1
integrin.  A  short motif (EPDIM), located on the C-teminal side of the fourth
domain, is essential for the binding to integrin [3].

The  crystal  structure  of two FAS1 domains (FAS1 3-4) of a fas1 protein have
been solved (see <PDB:1O70>) [4]. Each domain consists of seven-stranded wedge
and  at least five alpha helices. Two well-ordered N-acetylglucosamine moities
attached to a conserved asparagine are located in the interface region between
the two FAS1 domains.

Some of the proteins containing a FAS1 domain are listed below.

 - Drosophila fasciclin I (fas1) protein. A cell adhesion molecule involved in
   axon guidance. It is attached to the membrane by a GPI-anchor (4 copies).
 - Human  TGF-beta induced Ig-H3 (BIgH3) protein. Mutation in its FAS1 domains
   result  in  corneal  distrophy,  due to the deposition of insoluble protein
   aggregates (4 copies).
 - Arabidopsis fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (2 copies).
 - Volvox major cell adhesion protein (2 copies).
 - Bacterial immunogenic protein MPT70 (1 copy).
 - Human extracellular matrix protein periostin (4 copies).
 - Mammalian stabilin protein (7 copies).

The profile we developed covers the entire FAS1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
