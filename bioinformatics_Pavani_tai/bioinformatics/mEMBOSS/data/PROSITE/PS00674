********************************
* AAA-protein family signature *
********************************

A large family of ATPases has been described [1 to 5,E1] whose  key feature is
that they share  a  conserved region of about 220 amino acids that contains an
ATP-binding site.  This  family  is now called AAA, for 'A'TPases 'A'ssociated
with diverse  cellular   'A'ctivities. The proteins that belong to this family
either contain one or two AAA domains.

Proteins containing two AAA domains:

 - Mammalian  and  drosophila  NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)
   and the fungal homolog, SEC18. These proteins are involved in intracellular
   transport between the  endoplasmic reticulum  and Golgi, as well as between
   different Golgi cisternae.
 - Mammalian  transitional  endoplasmic  reticulum ATPase (previously known as
   p97 or  VCP)  which  is  involved  in  the  transfer  of membranes from the
   endoplasmic reticulum  to  the  golgi apparatus. This protein forms a ring-
   shaped homooligomer  composed  of  six subunits. The yeast homolog is CDC48
   and it may play a role in spindle pole proliferation.
 - Yeast  protein  PAS1,  essential  for  peroxisome  assembly and the related
   protein PAS1 from Pichia pastoris.
 - Yeast protein AFG2.
 - Sulfolobus  acidocaldarius  protein  SAV  and Halobacterium salinarium cdcH
   which may  be  part  of  a  transduction  pathway  connecting light to cell
   division.

Proteins containing a single AAA domain:

 - Escherichia    coli  and  other bacteria ftsH (or hflB) protein. FtsH is an
   ATP-dependent zinc metallopeptidase that seems  to  degrade  the heat-shock
   sigma-32 factor.   It   is  an  integral  membrane  protein  with  a  large
   cytoplasmic C-terminal  domain  that  contain both the AAA and the protease
   domains.
 - Yeast protein YME1, a protein  important  for  maintaining the integrity of
   the mitochondrial compartment. YME1 is also a zinc-dependent protease.
 - Yeast  protein  AFG3  (or  YTA10). This protein also seems to contain a AAA
   domain followed by a zinc-dependent protease domain.
 - Subunits  from  the  regulatory  complex of the 26S proteasome [6] which is
   involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins:
   a) Mammalian  subunit  4  and homologs in other higher eukaryotes, in yeast
      (gene YTA5) and fission yeast (gene mts2).
   b) Mammalian  subunit  6 (TBP7) and homologs in other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (gene YTA2).
   c) Mammalian subunit 7 (MSS1)  and  homologs in other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (gene CIM5 or YTA3).
   d) Mammalian subunit 8 (P45)  and  homologs in  other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (SUG1 or CIM3 or TBY1) and fission yeast (gene let1).
   d) Other probable subunits such as human TBP1 which seems to influences HIV
      gene expression by interacting with the virus tat transactivator protein
      and yeast YTA1 and YTA6.
 - Yeast protein BCS1, a mitochondrial protein essential for the expression of
   the Rieske iron-sulfur protein.
 - Yeast protein MSP1, a protein  involved  in  intramitochondrial  sorting of
   proteins.
 - Yeast  protein  PAS8,  and  the  corresponding  proteins  PAS5  from Pichia
   pastoris and PAY4 from Yarrowia lipolytica.
 - Mouse protein SKD1 and its fission yeast homolog (SpAC2G11.06).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans meiotic spindle formation protein mei-1.
 - Yeast protein SAP1.
 - Yeast protein YTA7.
 - Mycobacterium leprae hypothetical protein A2126A.

It is proposed that, in general, the AAA domains in these proteins act as ATP-
dependent protein clamps [5].

In addition  to  the  ATP-binding 'A' and 'B'  motifs  (see the relevant entry
<PDOC00017>), which  are  located in the N-terminal half of this domain, there
is a highly conserved region located in the central part of the  domain  which
we have used to develop a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMTR]-x-[LIVMT]-[LIVMF]-x-[GATMC]-[ST]-[NS]-x(4)-
                    [LIVM]-D-x-[AS]-[LIFAV]-x(1,2)-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 3 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This pattern will  only  detect  the  first domain of SEC18/NSF and the
 second domain  of  PAS1.  The  other  domain  in  these proteins is much less
 conserved outside of the ATP-binding region.
