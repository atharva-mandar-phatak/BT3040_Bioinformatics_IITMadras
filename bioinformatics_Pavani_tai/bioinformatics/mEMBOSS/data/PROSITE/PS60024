* Agouti domain signature and profile *
***************************************

The agouti   signaling   protein   (ASIP   or  the  agouti  protein)  and  its
neuropeptide homolog the agouti-related protein (AgRP) are paracrine signaling
molecules that  act  as  inverse  agonists at distinct subsets of melanocortin
receptors. ASIP   antagonizes  the  binding  of  alpha-melanocyte  stimulating
hormone (alpha-MSH)  to  melanocortin  1  receptor  (MC1R),  switching melanin
synthesis from  eumelanin  (black/brown)  to  phaeomelanin  (red/yellow).  The
effect of  ASIP on pigment type-switching is responsible for a variety of coat
color patterns accross a broad range of mammalian species. AgRP is involved in
energy balance  and  acts normally at the MC3R and MC4R to control body weight
regulation and metabolism [1,2].

Sequence similarity  between  ASIP  and  AgRP is confined to their Cys-rich C-
terminal domains, which are also responsible for melanocortin receptor binding
activity in vitro. Approximately 40 residues in length, there are ten cysteine
residues in  the C-terminal domain that form a network of five disulfide bonds
(see the   schematic  representation  below).  The  agouti  C-terminal  domain
contains a  three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, where the last two strands
form a  beta  hairpin  (see  <PDB:1HYK>). The hairpin's turn region presents a
triplet of  residues  (Arg-Phe-Phe)  known  to  be  essential for melanocortin
receptor binding.  The  agouti  C-terminal domain adopts the inhibitor cystine
knot (ICK)   or  knottin  fold  identified  in  numerous  invertebrate  toxins
[2,3,E1].
