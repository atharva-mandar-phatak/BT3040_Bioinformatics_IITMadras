* B5 domain profile *
*********************

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases  (aaRSs)  play a crucial role in the translation of
the genetic  code  by  means  of  covalent  attachment of amino acids to their
cognate tRNAs.  Phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) is known to be among the
most complex enzymes of the aaRS family. It is a heterodimeric class II enzyme
of the (AlphaBeta)2 type. The AlphaBeta heterodimer of Thermus thermophilus is
composed of  ten  structural  domains:  two  of them A1-A2 belong to the alpha
subunit and  eight B1-B8 to the beta subunit. The B5 domain is formed by three
alpha-helices and  three  antiparallel  beta-strands  and comprises a surface-
exposed "winged" helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (see <PDB:1PYS>) [1,2,3]. The B5
domain has been shown to bind DNA [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire B5 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
