* Fe(2+) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase domain profile *
****************************************************

Enzymes  with the Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase domain
typically  catalyse  the  oxidation  of  an organic substrate using a dioxygen
molecule,  mostly by using ferrous iron as the active site cofactor and 2OG as
a  cosubstrate  which  is  decarboxylated  to  succinate and CO2 [1]. Iron 2OG
dioxygenase  domain  proteins are widespread among eukaryotes and bacteria. In
metazoans, prolyl hydroxylases containing the domain act as oxygen sensors and
catalyse  the  hydroxylation of conserved prolyl residues in hypoxia-inducible
transcription  factor  (HIF)  alpha  [2,3].  In plants, Fe(II) 2OG dioxygenase
domain  enzymes  catalyse  the  formation of plant hormones, such as ethylene,
gibberellins,  anthocyanidins  and  pigments such as flavones. In bacteria and
fungi Fe(II) 2OG dioxygenase domain enzymes participate in the biosynthesis of
antibiotics  such  as  penicillin  and  cephalosporin  (see  <PDOC00165>). The
eukaryotic  and  bacterial protein AlkB that also shows this structural domain
is involved in DNA-repair [1,4].

The  Fe(2+)  2OG dioxygenase domain has a conserved beta-barrel structure (see
<PDB:2G19>) [2], which forms a double-stranded beta-helix core fold that forms
the predominant class of the cupin superfamily ('cupa' means a small barrel in
Latin) [5]. Two histidines and an aspartate residue catalytically bind a metal
ion,  in  general  iron  but in some cases another metal, directly involved in
catalysis.  A conserved arginine or lysine residue further near the C-terminal
part acts as the basic residue that interacts with the acidic substrate, which
for most of these enzymes is 2OG, but e.g. not for IPNS.

Some proteins known to contain a Fe(2+) 2OG dioxygenase domain:

 - Eukaryotic  prolyl  4-hydroxylase  subunit  alpha-2  (EC  1.14.11.2), which
   catalyses the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens
   and other proteins.
 - Metazoan  procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate  5-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.11.4),
   which forms hydroxylysine residues in collagen type IV (see <PDOC01028>).
 - Eukaryotic and bacterial alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB (EC
   1.14.11.-),  a  DNA  repair  enzyme  that  repairs  alkylated  DNA  and RNA
   containing 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidative demethylation.
 - Vertebrate  prolyl  3-hydroxylases  (EC  1.14.11.7) of the leprecan family,
   which  catalyse  the  post-translational  formation  of 3-hydroxyproline in
   collagens.
 - Actinobacterial  and  fungal isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) (EC 1.21.3.1),
   implicated in antibiotic biosynthesis (see <PDOC00165>).
 - Actinobacterial    and fungal deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) (EC
   1.14.20.1) and deacetoxycephalosporin C hydroxylase (DACS) (EC 1.14.11.26),
   which are implicated in antibiotic biosynthesis (see <PDOC00165>).
 - Enterobacterial  PKHD  (prolyl/lysyl hydroxylase)-type hydroxylase ybiX (EC
   1.14.11.-).
 - Viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.48).
 - Plant   gibberellin   2-beta-dioxygenases  (EC  1.14.11.13)  of  the  GA2OX
   subfamily of gibberellin (GAs) catabolic enzymes, which play a central role
   in plant development.
 - Plant   gibberellin   3-beta-dioxygenases  (EC  1.14.11.15)  of  the  GA3OX
   subfamily.
 - Plant   flavone   synthase  (EC  1.14.11.22),  flavonol  synthase/flavanone
   3-hydroxylase  (EC  1.14.11.23, EC 1.14.11.9) and naringenin,2-oxoglutarate
   3-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.9).
 - Plant   leucoanthocyanidin   dioxygenase   (LDOX)   (EC   1.14.11.19)   and
   deacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.20).
 - Plant  2'-deoxymugineic-acid  2'-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.24), mugineic-acid
   3-dioxygenase   (EC   1.14.11.25)   and   hyoscyamine   6-dioxygenase   (EC
   1.14.11.11).
 - Plant   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate   oxidases   (ACC  oxidases)  (EC
   1.14.17.4), which are ethylene-forming enzymes.
 - Plant  S-norcoclaurine  synthase  1 (CjNCS1) (EC 4.2.1.78), involved in the
   biosynthesis  of  the  common precursor of all benzylisoquinoline alkaloids
   such as morphine, sanguinarine, codeine or berberine.
