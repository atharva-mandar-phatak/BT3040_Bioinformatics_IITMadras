* 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases acyltransferase component lipoyl binding site *
***************************************************************************

The 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase  multienzyme complexes [1,2]  from  bacterial and
eukaryotic sources  catalyze  the  oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxo acids to
the corresponding acyl-CoA.   The three members  of this family of multienzyme
complexes are:

 - Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
 - 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC).
 - Branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC).

These three  complexes  share  a  common  architecture:   they are composed of
multiple copies  of three component enzymes - E1, E2 and E3.  E1 is a thiamine
pyrophosphate-dependent  2-oxo  acid  dehydrogenase,  E2     a dihydrolipamide
acyltransferase, and E3 an FAD-containing dihydrolipamide dehydrogenase.

E2 acyltransferases   have  an  essential  cofactor,  lipoic  acid,  which  is
covalently bound  via  a amide linkage to a lysine group. The E2 components of
OGCD and BCOACD bind a single lipoyl group, while those of PDC bind either one
(in yeast  and in Bacillus), two (in mammals), or three (in Azotobacter and in
Escherichia coli) lipoyl groups [3].

In addition to  the E2 components of the three  enzymatic  complexes described
above, a lipoic acid cofactor is also found in the following proteins:

 - H-protein of the  glycine cleavage system (GCS) [4]. GCS  is  a multienzyme
   complex of  four  protein  components,  which  catalyzes the degradation of
   glycine. H  protein  shuttles  the  methylamine group of glycine from the P
   protein to  the  T protein. H-protein from either prokaryotes or eukaryotes
   binds a single lipoic group.
 - Mammalian and  yeast  pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes differ  from that of
   other sources, in that they contain, in small amounts, a protein of unknown
   function -  designated  protein  X  or component X. Its sequence is closely
   related to that of E2 subunits and seems to bind a lipoic group [5].
 - Fast migrating protein (FMP) (gene acoC)  from  Alcaligenes  eutrophus [6].
   This protein is most probably a dihydrolipamide acyltransferase involved in
   acetoin metabolism.

We developed  a  signature  pattern  which allows the detection of the lipoyl-
binding site.

-Consensus pattern: [GDN]-x(2)-[LIVF]-x(3)-{VH}-{M}-[LIVMFCA]-x(2)-[LIVMFA]-
                    {LDFY}-{KPE}-x-K-[GSTAIVW]-[STAIVQDN]-x(2)-[LIVMFS]-x(5)-
                    [GCN]-x-[LIVMFY]
                    [K is the lipoyl-binding site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 6.

-Note: The domain  around  the  lipoyl-binding  lysine residue is evolutionary
 related to that around the biotin-binding lysine  residue of biotin requiring
 enzymes (see <PDOC00167>).
