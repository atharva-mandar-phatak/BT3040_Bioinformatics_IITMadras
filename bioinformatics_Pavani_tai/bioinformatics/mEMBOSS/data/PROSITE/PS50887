* GGDEF domain profile *
************************

The GGDEF  domain,  which  has been named after the conserved central sequence
pattern GG[DE][DE]F  is  widespread in prokaryotes. It is typically present in
multidomain  proteins  containing  regulatory domains of signaling pathways or
protein-protein or  protein-ligand  interaction  modules, such as the response
regulatory domain  (see  <PDOC50110)),  the  EAL domain (see <PDOC50883>), the
PAS/PAC  domain  (see  <PDOC50112>),  the  HAMP domain  (see <PDOC50885>), the
GAF  domain,  the  FHA  domain  (see  <PS50006>) or the TPR repeat. However  a
few single-domain  proteins  are  also known. The GGDEF domain is involved  in
signal transduction  and  is  likely  to  catalyze  synthesis or hydrolysis of
cyclic diguanylate  (c-diGMP,  bis(3',5')-cyclic diguanylic acid), an effector
molecule that consists of two cGMP moieties bound head-to-tail [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a GGDEF domain are listed below:

 - Acetobacter    xylinus    diguanylate    cyclases   (DGCs)   and   c-di-GMP
   phosphodiesterases A (PDEAs).
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yhcK.
 - Caulobacter  crescentus  pleD  protein,  a response regulator that controls
   cell differentiation in the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition.
 - Rhizobium celR2, a putative response regulator protein.
 - Salmonella protein adrA.

The profile we developed covers the entire GGDEF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
