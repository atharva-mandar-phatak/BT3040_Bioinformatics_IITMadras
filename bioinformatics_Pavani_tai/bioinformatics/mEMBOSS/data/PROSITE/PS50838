* MAGE conserved domain profile *
*********************************

The first  mammalian  members  of  the MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) gene
family were originally described as completely silent in normal adult tissues,
with the  exception  of  male  germ cells, and, for some of them, placenta. By
contrast, these genes were expressed in various kind of tumors. However, other
members of  the  family  were  recently found to be expressed in normal cells,
indicating that  the  family  is  larger  and  more  disparate  than initially
expected. MAGE-like  genes have also been identified in non-mammalian species,
like the  zebrafish  or  Drosophila  melanogaster. Although no MAGE homologous
sequences have   been  identified  in  Caenorhabditis  elegans,  Saccharomyces
cerevisiae or  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe,  MAGE  sequences have been found in
several vegetal species, including Arabidopsis thaliana [1].

The only  region  of  homology shared by all of the members of the family is a
stretch of  about  200  amino  acids  which  has been named the MAGE conserved
domain. The  MAGE  conserved domain is usually located close to the C-termini,
although it can also be found in a more central position in some proteins. The
MAGE conserved  domain  is  generally  present  as  a  single  copy  but it is
duplicated in  some  proteins.  It  has  been proposed that the MAGE conserved
domain  of  MAGE-D  proteins might  interact  with p75 neurotrophin or related
receptors [1].

Proteins known to contain a MAGE domain are listed below:

 - Human MAGE-A, -B and -C proteins. MAGE-A, -B and -C genes are silent in all
   normal tissues with the exception of testis.
 - Human  MAGE-D  to  -L  proteins. MAGE-D to -L genes are expressed in normal
   adult tissues.
 - Mouse Mage-a and -b proteins.
 - Mouse Mage-d, -e, -g, -h, -k and -l.
 - Mammalian Necdin. The human Necdin gene is a candidate for the Prader-Willi
   syndrome.

The profile we developed covers the entire MAGE domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
