* Chromo domain signature and profile *
***************************************

The 'chromo' (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) domain [1 to 4] is a conserved
region of  about  60  amino acids which was first identified in the drosophila
chromatin proteins  HP1  and  Polycomb.  Chromo  domain have now been found in
single or  multiple  copies  in  a variety of eukaryotic proteins with diverse
structures and  activities, most or all of which are connected with chromosome
structure/function. Functional  dissections of chromo domain proteins suggests
a mechanistic  role  for chromo domains in targeting chromo domain proteins to
specific regions  of  the  nucleus.  The  mechanism  of  targeting may involve
protein-protein and/or  protein/nucleic acid interactions. Hence, several line
of evidence  show  that  the  HP1  chromo  domain is a methyl-specific histone
binding module,  whereas  the  chromo  domain of two protein components of the
drosophila dosage  compensation  complex, MSL3 and MOF, contain chromo domains
that bind to RNA in vitro [5].

HP1 was  found  to  have  a second chromo domain in the C-terminal half of the
protein, called the 'chromo shadow' domain, with weak but significant sequence
similarity to the N-terminal chromo domain. Various chromo shadow domains have
been shown to mediate self-association, pointing to a general property of this
motif. However,  chromo  shadow  domains  have been implicated in a variety of
heterologous interactions  as  well.  Hence  the chromo shadow domain of human
HP1-family proteins  has  been  found to bind to lamin B receptor in yeast two
hybrid protein assay [5].

The high  resolution structures of HP1-family protein chromo and chromo shadow
domain reveal  a  conserved  chromo domain fold motif consisting of three beta
strands packed  against  an alpha helix. The chromo domain fold belongs to the
OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide  binding)-fold class found in a variety of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding protein [5].

Some proteins  known  to  contain  a chromo or chromo shadow domain are listed
below:

 - Drosophila heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1).
 - Human heterochromatin protein HP1 alpha.
 - Mammalian modifier 1 and modifier 2.
 - Fission  yeast  swi6,  a  protein  involved in the repression of the silent
   mating-type loci mat2 and mat3.
 - Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc).
 - Mammalian modifier 3, a homolog of Pc.
 - Drosophila protein Su(var)3-9, a suppressor of position-effect variegation.
 - Human Mi-2 autoantigen, characterisitic of dermatomyosis.
 - Fungal  retrotranposon  polyproteins:  'skippy'  from  Fusarium  oxysporum,
   'grasshopper' and  'MAGGY'   from   Magnaporthe   grisea   and  CfT-1  from
   Cladosporium fulvum.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC18G6.02c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C29H12.5
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK1236.2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09A5.8.
 - Mammalian DNA-binding/helicase proteins CHD-1 to CHD-4.
 - Yeast protein CHD1.
 - Drosophila male-specific lethal-3 protein (MSL-3).
 - Drosophila males absent on the first (MOF).
 - Tetrahymena thermophila Pdds (programmed DNA degradation), factors that
   appear to participate in the recognition and removal of DNA during
   macronuclear differentiation.

The signature  pattern  for  this  domain  corresponds  to  its best conserved
section, which  is  located  in its central part. We also developed a profile,
which covers the entire chromo and chromo shadow domains.

-Consensus pattern: [FYL]-x-[LIVMC]-[KR]-W-x-[GDNR]-[FYWLME]-x(5,6)-[ST]-W-
                    [ESV]-[PSTDEN]-x(2,3)-[LIVMC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL   chromo
 domains, but does not detect chromo shadow domains.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
