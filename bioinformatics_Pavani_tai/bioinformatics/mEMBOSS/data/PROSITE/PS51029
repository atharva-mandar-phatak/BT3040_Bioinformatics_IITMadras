* MADF domain profile *
***********************

The myb/SANT-like  domain  in  Adf-1  (MADF)  is  a ~80-amino-acid module that
directs sequence  specific  DNA  binding  to  a  site  consisting  of multiple
trinucleotide repeats.  The  MADF  domain  is  found  in one or more copies in
eukaryotic and  viral  proteins  and  is often associated with the BESS domain
(see <PDOC51031>) [1,2,3].

It is  likely  that  the  MADF  domain is more closely related to the myb/SANT
domain than it is to other HTH domains [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a MADF domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila  Adf-1,  a transcription factor first identified on the basis of
   its interaction  with the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter but that binds the
   promoters of a diverse group of genes [1].
 - Drosophila  Dorsal-interacting  protein  3  (Dip3). It functions both as an
   activator to  bind  DNA  in  a  sequence  specific manner and a coactivator
   to stimulate synergistic activation by Dorsal and Twist [2].
 - Drosophila  Stonewall  (Stwl), a putative transcription factor required for
   maintenance of   female   germline   stem   cells   as   well   as   oocyte
   differentiation.

The profile we developed covers the entire MADF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
