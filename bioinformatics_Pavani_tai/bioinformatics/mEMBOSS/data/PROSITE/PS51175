* CBM6 (carbohydrate binding type-6) domain profile *
*****************************************************

Carbohydrate-binding  modules  (CBM)  have  been  classified into more than 40
families  according  to  sequence  homology [E1]. Several cellulolytic enzymes
share  a  conserved  region  of about 120 amino acid residues, the CBM6 domain
[1].  The CBM6 domain is distinct from others CBMs in that this protein module
contains  multiple  distinct  ligand  binding  sites.  CBM6  domains  bind  to
amorphous  cellulose,  xylan,  mixed beta-(1,3)(1,4)glucan and beta-1,3-glucan
[1,2,3].

The  CBM6  domain  is  mainly  found C-terminal to the catalytic domain, which
corresponds to a wide range of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases such as family 16
(see <PDOC00794>), or family 10 (see <PDOC00510>).

The  crystal structure of CBM6 domain has been solved (see <PDB:1GMM>) [4]. It
adopts a classic lectin-like beta-jelly roll fold, predominantly consisting of
five  antiparallel beta-strands on one face and four antiparallel beta-strands
on  the  other  face.  It  contains  two potential ligand binding sites, named
respectively  cleft  A and B. These clefts include aromatic residues which are
probably  involved  in  the  substrate  binding. The cleft B is located on the
concave  surface of one beta-sheet, and the cleft A on one edge of the protein
between  the  loop  that connects the inner and outer beta-sheets of the jelly
roll  fold  [4].  The  multiple  binding  clefts confer the extensive range of
specificities displayed by the domain [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a CBM6 domain are listed below:

 - The  bacterial  Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase A, B, C, E, J, U, V, Y and Z  (xynA,
   xynB, xynC, xynE, xynJ, xynU, xynV, xynY, and xynZ). They are  involved  in
   the  endohydrolysis  of 1,4-beta-D-xylosidic linkages in xylans (EC 3.2.1.8
   and EC 3.2.1.55).
 - The  Piromyces sp. Mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase A (manA) (EC 3.2.1.78).

The profile we developed covers the whole CBM6 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  CBM6  domain  is also known as  cellulose-binding domain family VI
 (CBD VI).
