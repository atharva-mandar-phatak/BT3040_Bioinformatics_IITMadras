* Tensin phosphatase and C2 domain profiles *
*********************************************

Tensins constitute an eukaryotic family of lipid phosphatases that are defined
by  the  presence  of  two  adjacent domains: a lipid phosphatase domain and a
C2-like domain. The tensin-type C2 lacks the canonical Ca(2+) ligands found in
classical  C2  domains (see <PDOC00380>), and in this respect it is similar to
the  C2  domains  of  PKC-type  [1,2].  The  tensin-type  C2  domain  can bind
phospholipid  membranes  in  a Ca(2+)  independent  manner  [3]. In the  tumor
suppressor  protein  PTEN,  the  best  characterized member of the family, the
lipid  phosphatase  domain  was  shown  to specifically dephosphorylate the D3
position   of   the   inositol   ring   of   the   lipid   second   messenger,
phosphatydilinositol-3-4-5-triphosphate  (PIP3).  The lipid phosphatase domain
contains  the  signature motif HCXXGXXR present in the active sites of protein
tyrosine   phosphatases  (PTPs)  and  dual  specificity  phosphatases  (DSPs).
Furthermore,   two  invariant  lysines  are  found  only  in  the  tensin-type
phosphatase  motif (HCKXGKXR) and are suspected to interact with the phosphate
group at position D1 and D5 of the inositol ring [1,3].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  PTEN  tumor  suppressor has been solved (see
<PDB:1D5R>)  [3].  The lipid phosphatase domain has a structure similar to the
dual  specificity  phosphatase  (see  <PDOC00323>). However, PTEN has a larger
active  site  pocket  that  could  be important to accomodate PI(3,4,5)P3. The
tensin-type  C2 domain has a structure similar to the classical C2 domain that
mediates   the  Ca2+  dependent  membrane  recruitment  of  several  signaling
proteins.  However  the tensin-type C2 domain lacks two of the three conserved
loops that bind Ca2+.

Proteins known to contain a phosphatase and a C2 tensin-type domain are listed
below:

 - Tensin,  a focal-adhesion molecule that binds to actin filaments. It may be
   involved  in  cell  migration,  cartilage development and in linking signal
   transduction pathways to the cytoskeleton.
 - Phosphatase  and  tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 protein (PTEN).
   It  antagonizes  PI 3-kinase signalling by dephosphorylating the 3-position
   of  the  inositol  ring  of  PI(3,4,5)P3  and  thus  inactivates downstream
   signalling.  It  plays major roles both during development and in the adult
   to control cell size, growth, and survival.
 - Auxilin.  It  binds  clathrin  heavy  chain  and promotes its assembly into
   regular cages.
 - Cyclin  G-associated  kinase  or  auxilin-2. It is a potential regulator of
   clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking.

Each profile covers the whole domain for which it was developed.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note:  PTEN  homologues in fungi have the tensin phosphatase domain, but they
 lack the C2 domain.
