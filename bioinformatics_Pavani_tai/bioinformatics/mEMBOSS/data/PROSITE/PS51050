*******************************
* Zinc finger CW-type profile *
*******************************

The  CW  domain  is  composed  of  four conserved cysteines and two tryptophan
residues. The four cysteines could coordinate one zinc atom to form a new type
of  zinc  finger.  It  is found exclusively in vertebrate, vertebrate-infected
parasites and higher plants. The function of this zinc finger is not yet known
but  its  taxonomic distribution and its association with a variety of domains
involved  in  DNA  binding, methylation, chromatin structure or ubiquitination
suggest  a  putative  role  in epigenetic mechanisms and embryonic development
[1].

The profile we developed covers the whole CW-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / First entry.
