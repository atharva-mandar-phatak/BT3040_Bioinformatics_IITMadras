* Hexokinases signature *
*************************

Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) [1,2] is an important glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
the phosphorylation  of keto-  and  aldohexoses  (e.g.  glucose,  mannose  and
fructose) using MgATP as the phosphoryl donor.

In vertebrates there  are four major isoenzymes, commonly referred as types I,
II, III and IV.  Type IV hexokinase,  which  is  often  incorrectly designated
glucokinase [3], is  only  expressed  in  liver and  pancreatic beta-cells and
plays an important role in modulating insulin secretion;  it is a protein of a
molecular mass of about 50 Kd.   Hexokinases of types I to III, which have low
Km values for glucose,  have a  molecular mass of about 100 Kd.   Structurally
they consist of a very small N-terminal  hydrophobic  membrane-binding  domain
followed by two highly similar domains of 450 residues.   The first domain has
lost its catalytic activity and has evolved into a regulatory domain.

In yeast there  are  three  different isozymes: hexokinase PI (gene HXK1), PII
(gene HXKB), and glucokinase (gene GLK1). All three proteins  have a molecular
mass of about 50 Kd.

All these enzymes contain one  (or two in the case of types I to III isozymes)
strongly conserved region which has been shown [4] to be involved in substrate
binding. We have derived a pattern from that region.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-G-F-[TN]-F-S-[FY]-P-x(5)-[LIVM]-[DNST]-x(3)-[LIVM]-
                    x(2)-W-T-K-x-[LF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
