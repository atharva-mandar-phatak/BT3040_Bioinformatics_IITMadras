* Prokaryotic-type class I peptide chain release factors signature *
********************************************************************

Peptide chain  release  factors (RFs) are  required  for  the  termination  of
protein biosynthesis [1]. At present two  classes of RFs can be distinguished.
Class I  RFs  bind  to  ribosomes  that have encountered a stop codon at their
decoding site  and induce release of the nascent polypeptide. Class II RFs are
GTP-binding proteins  that  interact  with  class I RFs and enhance class I RF
activity.

In prokaryotes  there  are two class I RFs that act in a codon specific manner
[2]: RF-1 (gene prfA)  mediates UAA  and UAG-dependent  termination while RF-2
(gene prfB)  mediates    UAA  and UGA-dependent termination. RF-1 and RF-2 are
structurally and  evolutionary  related  proteins which have been shown [3] to
make up a family that also contains the following proteins:

 - Fungal  MRF1,  a  mitochondrial  RF (m-RF) which recognizes the UAA and UAG
   codons.
 - Escherichia coli RF-H, a protein of unknown function.
 - Escherichia coli  hypothetical protein yaeJ  and a close Pseudomonas putida
   homolog.

We use as a signature pattern a highly conserved region located in the central
part of the 40 to 45 Kd RF-1/2 and m-RF and in  the N-terminal of the 15 to 16
Kd RF-H and yaeJ.

-Consensus pattern: [ARH]-[STA]-x-G-x-G-G-Q-[HNGCSY]-[VI]-N-x(3)-[ST]-[AKG]-
                    [IV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Prokaryotic-type class I RFs display no significant sequence similarity
 to prokaryotic-type  class  II  which  belong  to  the  family of GTP-binding
 elongation factors  (see  <PDOC00273>)  nor to eukaryotic class I or class II
 RFs.
