*********************************
* Ly-6 / u-PAR domain signature *
*********************************

A variety of GPI-linked cell-surface glycoproteins are composed of one or more
copies of a conserved domain  of  about  100 amino-acid residues [1,2].  These
proteins are:

 - Urokinase  plasminogen  activator  surface  receptor  u-PAR, which binds to
   u-PA and is responsible for its proteolysis-independent signal transduction
   activation effects.
 - The mouse family of Ly-6 T-cell antigens (Ly-6A, -6C, -6E, -6F and -6G).
 - CD59  (MACIF  or  MIRL),  an  inhibitor  of  the complement membrane attack
   complex action.
 - Herpesvirus saimiri CD59-related protein (gene 15).
 - Mouse thymocyte B cell antigen (ThB).
 - Squid glycoprotein Sgp-2.

U-PAR contains  three  tandem  copies  of the domain, while all the others are
made up of a single domain.

As shown  in  the  following  schematic,  this  conserved  domain  contains 10
cysteine residues  involved in five disulfide bonds - in u-PAR, the first copy
of the domain lacks the fourth disulfide bond.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

The signature  pattern  that  detects this domain starts towards its extremity
and ends at the sixth cysteine.

-Consensus pattern: [EQR]-C-[LIVMFYAH]-x-C-x(5,8)-C-x(3,8)-[EDNQSTV]-C-{C}-
                    x(5)-C-x(12,24)-C
                    [The 6 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
