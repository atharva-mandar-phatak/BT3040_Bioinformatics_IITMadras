* Nuclear transition protein 2 signatures *
*******************************************

In mammals, the second  stage  of  spermatogenesis  is  characterized  by  the
conversion of  nucleosomal  chromatin   to  the  compact,  nonnucleosomal  and
transcriptionally inactive form found in the sperm nucleus.  This condensation
is  associated  with  a  double-protein  transition.   The  first   transition
corresponds to the  replacement  of  histones  by  several  spermatid-specific
proteins, also called transition proteins, which  are  themselves  replaced by
protamines during the second transition.

Nuclear transition   protein  2  (TP2)  is  one  of  those  spermatid-specific
proteins.  TP2 is a basic,  zinc-binding protein [1] of  116 to 137 amino-acid
residues. Structurally,  TP2   consists of  three  distinct parts: a conserved
serine-rich N-terminal  domain of about 25 residues, a variable central domain
of 20  to  50  residues  which  contains cysteine residues, and a conserved C-
terminal domain of about 70 residues rich in lysines and arginines.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for TP2: one located in the N-terminal
domain, the other in the C-terminal.
