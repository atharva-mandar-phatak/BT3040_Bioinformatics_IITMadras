* Endopeptidase Clp active sites *
**********************************

The endopeptidase Clp (EC 3.4.21.92) from Escherichia coli cleaves peptides in
various proteins in a process that  requires  ATP  hydrolysis [1,2].  Clp is a
dimeric protein which consists of a proteolytic subunit (gene clpP) and either
of two related ATP-binding regulatory subunits (genes clpA and clpX).  ClpP is
a serine  protease  which  has  a chymotrypsin-like  activity.  Its  catalytic
activity seems to be  provided by a charge relay system similar to that of the
trypsin family   of   serine  proteases,  but  which  evolved  by  independent
convergent evolution.

Proteases highly  similar to ClpP  have been found to be encoded in the genome
of the chloroplast of plants and seem to be also present in other eukaryotes.

The sequences around two of the  residues  involved  in the catalytic triad (a
serine and a histidine)  are  highly  conserved  and  can be used as signature
patterns specific to that category of proteases.

-Consensus pattern: T-x(2)-[LIVMF]-G-x-A-[SAC]-S-[MSA]-[PAG]-[STA]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 three sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Consensus pattern: R-x(3)-[EAP]-x(3)-[LIVMFYT]-[LM]-[LIVM]-H-Q-P
                    [H is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 two sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Note: These proteins belong to family S14 in the classification of peptidases
 [3,E1].
