* Neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) domain profile *
*********************************************************

Proteins of  the  neuroblastoma  breakpoint  family  (NBPF)  contain  a highly
conserved domain  of  unknown  function, which has been named the NBPF domain.
The NBPF  domain is present in multiple copies in NBPF proteins and once, with
lower homology,  in mammalian myomegalin (PDE4DIP), a protein localized in the
Golgi/centrosomal area  which functions as an anchor to localize components of
the cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate-dependent  pathway  to  this  region. The
number of  NBPF repeat copies is highly expanded in humans, reduced in African
great apes, further reduced in orangutan and Old World monkeys, single-copy in
nonprimate mammals,  and  absent in nonmammalian species. The NBPF domain that
is found  as  a  singly  copy  in  nonprimate  mammals is the likely ancestral
domain. The  implications  of  the  resemblance of NBPF proteins to myomegalin
remain obscure  as  no  functional  properties  have been ascribed to the NBPF
domains. NBPF domains are typically built of two exons [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire NBPF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
