* LysR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  lysR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about  60 residues present in lysR-type transcriptional regulators
(LTTR),  one  of the most common regulator families in prokaryotes. The family
is  named  after  the  Escherichia  coli regulator lysR [1]. LysR proteins are
present in diverse bacterial genera, archaea and algal chloroplasts. All LTTRs
contain  the DNA-binding lysR-type HTH domain, usually in the N-terminal part.
Most  LTTRs  require  a small compound that acts as co-inducer. The C-terminal
part  of  lysR  proteins  can  contain a regulatory domain with two subdomains
involved  in  (1)  co-inducer  recognition/response  and  (2)  DNA binding and
response. LTTRs activate the transcription of operons and regulons involved in
very  diverse  functions,  such  as  amino  acid  biosynthesis,  CO2 fixation,
antibiotic   resistance,  regulation  of  virulence  factors,  nodulation  for
nitrogen  fixing  bacteria,  oxidative  stress  response or aromatic compounds
catabolism.

Most  LTTRs act as a transcriptional activator of the target genes and also as
a repressor of their own expression. Typical LTTRs bind to a sequence of about
50-60  bp,  which  contains two distinct sites, (1) a recognition-binding site
(RBS)  centered  near  -65  of the target transcription start site and with an
inverted   repeat   motif   including   the   T-N(11)-A   motif   and  (2)  an
activation-binding   site   (ABS)   which  overlaps  the  -35  region  of  the
transcription  start  site  of  the  regulated  gene. LysR proteins are mainly
cytoplasmic, but some seem membrane-bound [2].

The crystal structure of the lysR DNA-binding domain of CbnR shows three alpha
helices  and  two  anti-parallel  beta  strands  (see <PDB:1IXC>),   with  the
helix-turn-helix motif comprising the second and third helices and the strands
being called the wing. Most LTTRs are likely tetramers [3].

Some proteins known to contain a lysR domain:

 - Proteus vulgaris blaA, a transcriptional regulator of beta-lactamase.
 - Pseudomonas  putida  catR,  a regulator of catechol catabolism for benzoate
   degradation.
 - Escherichia coli cynR, a regulator for detoxification of cyanate.
 - Klebsiella aerogenes cysB, a regulator of cysteine biosynthesis.
 - Vibrio cholerae irgB, an iron-dependent regulator of virulence factors.
 - Escherichia coli lysR, a transcriptional regulator of lysine biosynthesis.
 - Escherichia coli nhaR, a regulator of a sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporter.
 - Rhizobium  meliloti  nodD and syrM, regulators of nodulation genes involved
   in nitrogen fixation symbiosis.
 - Salmonella typhimurium oxyR, a regulator of intracellular hydrogen peroxide
   and oxydative stress response.
 - Ralstonia solanacearum phcA, a regulator of virulence factors.
