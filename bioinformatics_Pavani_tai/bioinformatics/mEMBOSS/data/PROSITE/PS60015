********************************
* Mu-agatoxin family signature *
********************************

Spider mu-agatoxins  are  cysteine-rich insecticidal polypeptides, which cause
gradual but  irreversible  paralysis. These toxins cause repetitive firing and
massive transmitter  release  (which  is mediated by glutamate receptors) from
presynaptic stores at neuromuscular junctions [1].

The mu-agatoxin family contains:

 - Mu-agatoxin 1-6 from Agelenopsis aperta (Funnel-web spider),
 - Curtatoxin 1-3 from Hololena curta (Funnel-web spider),
 - Delta-palutoxin IT1, IT2, IT3 and IT4 from Paracoelotes luctuosus (Spider),
 - Toxin  ACTX-Hi:OB4219  from  Hadronyche  infensa  (Fraser island funnel-web
   spider).

Mu-agatoxin family  proteins have a [C-C-CC-C-C-C-C] cysteine arrangement. The
three dimensional  structure  of mu-agatoxins possesses a knottin scafold (see
<PDOC60004>) [E1]  with  a fourth pair of cysteine residues (marked '#' in the
following schematic representation) involved in a vicinal disulfide linkage.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'#': fourth pair of cysteine residues.

Our signature  pattern for mu-agatoxins contains the eight conserved cysteines
involved in disulfide bonds.

-Consensus pattern: C-[LAV]-x-[DEK]-X(3)-C-x(6,7)-C-C-x(4)-C-x-C-x(5)-C-x-C
                    [The 8 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
