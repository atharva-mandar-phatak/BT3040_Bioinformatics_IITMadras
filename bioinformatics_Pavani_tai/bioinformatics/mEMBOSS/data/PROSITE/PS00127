* Pancreatic ribonuclease family signature *
********************************************

Pancreatic ribonucleases (EC 3.1.27.5)  are pyrimidine-specific  endonucleases
present in high  quantity in the pancreas of a number of mammalian taxa and of
a few reptiles [1,2].    As shown in the following schematic representation of
the sequence of pancreatic RNases there are four conserved disulfide bonds and
three amino acid residues involved in the catalytic activity.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'#': active site residue.
'*': position of the pattern.

A number of other proteins  belongs to  the  pancreatic RNAse family and these
are listed below.

 - Bovine seminal vesicle and bovine brain ribonucleases.
 - The kidney non-secretory  ribonucleases  (also  known as eosinophil-derived
   neurotoxin (EDN) [3]).
 - Liver-type ribonucleases [4].
 - Angiogenin, which induces vascularization of normal  and malignant tissues.
   It abolishes protein synthesis by specifically hydrolyzing cellular tRNAs.
 - Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) [5],  a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with
   ribonuclease activity.
 - Frog liver ribonuclease and frog sialic acid-binding lectin [6].

The signature pattern we  developed for these proteins includes five conserved
residues: a cysteine  involved in a disulfide  bond, a lysine  involved in the
catalytic activity and three other residues important for substrate binding.

-Consensus pattern: C-K-x(2)-N-T-F
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
                    [K is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.
