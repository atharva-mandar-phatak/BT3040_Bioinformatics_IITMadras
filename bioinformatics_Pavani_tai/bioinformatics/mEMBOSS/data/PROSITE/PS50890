* PUA domain profile *
**********************

The PUA  domain,  which  has  been  named  after  PseudoUridine  synthase  and
Archaeosine-specific transglycosylase,   is   a  small,  compact  domain  that
consists of  78-83  amino acid residues. The PUA domain is widely conserved in
eukaryotic and archaeal RNA modification enzymes and is found in:

 - Archaeal and eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases.
 - Archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylases.
 - A family of predicted ATPases that may be involved in RNA modification.
 - A family of predicted archaeal and bacterial rRNA methylases.
 - A conserved family of putative novel eukaryotic translation factors.
 - Glutamate 5-kinases (EC 2.7.2.11).

The PUA  domain  can be found alone or in association with other domains, such
as the  glutamate  kinase domain (see <PDOC00701>), the pseudouridine synthase
catalytic domain, the phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain,
the methylase  domain,  the TGT domain, or the SUI1 domain (see <PDOC00862 >).
The PUA  domain  is  supposed  to  bind  to  RNA molecules with complex folded
structures [1].

The PUA  domain  contains highly conserved motifs that center around stretches
of hydrophobic  residues.  The  domain  also  contains  two  highly  conserved
positions occupied   by  small  amino  acids  (primarily  glycines)  [1].  The
resolution of    the    crystal    structure   of   archaeosine   tRNA-guanine
transglycosylase from  Pyrococcus  horikoshii  has  shown  that the PUA domain
consists of  two  alpha-helices  and  six beta-strands, and folds into a beta-
sandwich structure  similar  to  the  oligonucleotide-binding  (OB)-fold  (see
<PDB:1IQ8>) [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire PUA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
