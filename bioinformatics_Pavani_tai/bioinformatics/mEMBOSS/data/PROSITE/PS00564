* Argininosuccinate synthase signatures *
*****************************************

Argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) (AS)  is  a   urea  cycle enzyme  that
catalyzes the  penultimate  step  in  arginine biosynthesis: the ATP-dependent
ligation of  citrulline    to  aspartate  to  form  argininosuccinate, AMP and
pyrophosphate [1,2].

In humans,  a  defect  in  the AS gene causes citrullinemia, a genetic disease
characterized by severe vomiting spells and mental retardation.

AS is  a  homotetrameric enzyme of chains of about 400 amino-acid residues. An
arginine seems to be important for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.

The sequences of AS  from various prokaryotes, archaebacteria  and  eukaryotes
show significant similarity.  We  selected  two signature patterns for AS. The
first is a highly conserved stretch of nine residues located in the N-terminal
extremity of  these  enzymes,  the  second  is derived from a conserved region
which contains one of the conserved arginine residues.
