*********************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is  known  as  the  cellulase  family K or as the glycosyl hydrolases
family 45  [3,E1].  The  enzymes  which  are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Endoglucanase 5 from Humicola insolens.
 - Endoglucanase 5 from Trichoderma reesei (egl5).
 - Endoglucanase K from Fusarium oxysporum.
 - Endoglucanase B from Pseudomonas fluorescens (celB).
 - Endoglucanase 1 from Ustilago maydis (egl1).

The best  conserved  regions  in  these  enzymes is  located in the N-terminal
section. It  contains an aspartic acid residue which has been shown [4] to act
as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. We use this region as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [STA]-T-R-Y-[FYW]-D-x(5)-[CA]
                    [The D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
