* Clathrin light chains signatures *
************************************

Clathrin [1,2] is the major coat-forming  protein  that encloses vesicles such
as coated pits and forms cell  surface  patches  involved  in membrane traffic
within eukaryotic cells.  The clathrin coats (called triskelions) are composed
of three heavy chains (180 Kd) and three light chains (23 to 27 Kd).

The clathrin light chains [3], which  may help to properly orient the assembly
and disassembly of the clathrin coats, bind non-covalently to the heavy chain,
they also bind calcium and interact with the hsc70 uncoating ATPase.

 - In higher eukaryotes two genes code  for distinct but related light chains:
   LC(a) and LC(b).  Each  of  the  two  genes  can  yield, by tissue-specific
   alternative splicing, two separate forms which differ by the insertion of a
   sequence of respectively  thirty or eighteen residues.  There is, in the N-
   terminal part of the clathrin light chains  a  domain  of  twenty one amino
   acid residues which is perfectly conserved in LC(a) and LC(b).
 - In yeast there is a single light chain (gene CLC1)  whose  sequence is only
   distantly related to that of higher eukaryotes.

We developed two signature  patterns  for  clathrin  light  chains.  The first
pattern is a  heptapeptide from the center of the  conserved N-terminal region
of eukaryotic light chains;  the  second  pattern is derived from a positively
charged region located in the C-terminal extremity of all known clathrin light
chains.

-Consensus pattern: F-L-A-[QH]-[QE]-E-S
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL   higher
 eukaryotes light chains.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [KR]-[DS]-x-[SE]-[KR]-[LIVMF]-[KR]-x-[LIVM]-[LIVMY]-
                    [LIVM]-x-L-[KA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Patterns and text revised.
