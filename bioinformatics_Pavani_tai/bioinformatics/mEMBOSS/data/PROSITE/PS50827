* DDT domain profile *
**********************

The DDT  has  been  named after the better characterized DNA-binding homeobox-
containing proteins  and  the Different Transcription and chromatin remodeling
factors in  which it is found. It is a domain of about 60 amino acids which is
exclusively associated  with  nuclear  domains like AT-Hook (see <PDOC00306>),
PHD finger  (see  <PDOC50016>),  methyl-CpG-binding  domain,  bromodomain (see
<PDOC00550>) and DNA-binding homeodomain (see <PDOC00027>).

The DDT  domain is characterized by a number of conserved aromatic and charged
residues and  is  predicted  to  consist of three alpha helices. A DNA-binding
function for the DDT domain has been proposed [1].

Proteins known to contain a DDT domain are listed below:

 - Bromodomain  PHD  finger  transcription factors (BPTFs) from Caenorhabditis
   elegans, Drosophila  and  human. The human protein FALZ or FAC1 is believed
   to play arole in Alzheimer's disease.
 - Chromatin  remodeling  factors  of  the  BAZ  (bromodomain adjacent to zinc
   finger proteins)-family  from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and human.
   The human  BAZ  protein  WSTF  is implicated in Wiliams Syndrome, a complex
   developmental disorder with multisystemic defects.
 - Homeodomain-containing proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana.
 - Hypothetical PHD-domain-containing protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

The profile we developed covers the entire DDT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  DDT  domain  was  first  identified in the BAZ family as part of a
 larger LH (Leucine-rich Helical) domain [2].
