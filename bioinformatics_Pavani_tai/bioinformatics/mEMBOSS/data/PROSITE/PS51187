* Autoinducer synthase family signature and profile *
*****************************************************

Autoinducers  are  hormone-like  molecules  produced by bacteria as signals to
sense  cell  density  and  activate  adaptations,  by  a process termed quorum
sensing.  N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL) is a molecule produced
by  a  number of Gram-negative bacteria that acts as an autoinducer by binding
to  transcriptional  regulatory  proteins  and activating them [1,2]. OHHL and
related  molecules  such  as  N-butanoyl-  (BHL),  N-hexanoyl-  (HHL)  and  N-
oxododecanoyl-  (PAI) homoserine lactones are produced by a family of proteins
which have a length of about 200 amino acids. The 3D structures of autoinducer
synthases (see  <PDB:1KZF>)  have  features  essential  for phosphopantetheine
binding   and   N-acylation   that   are   similar  to  that  of  Gcn5-related
N-acetyltransferases (GNAT) (see <PDOC51186>) [3,4].

Some proteins currently known to belong to the autoinducer synthase family:

 - Vibrio  fischeri  luxI. The target of OHHL is the luxR protein that acts in
   the regulation of bioluminescence genes.
 - Aeromonas  ahyI  and asaI, which synthesize BHL and whereof the targets are
   ahyR and asaR.
 - Agrobacterium  tumefaciens traI. The target of OHHL is traR which regulates
   Ti plasmid transfer.
 - Erwinia  carotovora  carI. The target of OHHL is carR which activates genes
   involved in the biosynthesis of carbapenem antibiotics.
 - Erwinia  carotovora  expI.  The target of OHHL is expR which is involved in
   virulence  (soft  rot  disease)  by  activating  the genes for plant tissue
   macerating enzymes.
 - Erwinia stewartii esaI. The target of OHHL is esaR which is involved in the
   regulation of the biosynthesis of EPS virulence factor.
 - Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasI, which synthesizes PAI and whose target is lasR
   which activates the transcription of the elastase gene.
 - Pseudomonas  aureofaciens  phzI,  whose  target  is  phzR, the activator of
   phenazine biosynthetic genes.
 - Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  rhlI  (or vsmI), which synthesizes BHL and HHL and
   whose target is rhlR.
 - Serratia liquefaciens swrI, which synthesizes BHL.
 - Enterobacter agglomerans eagI.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica yenI.

The  best conserved region is located in the N-terminal region and can be used
as  a  signature  pattern. We also developed a profile which covers the entire
autoinducer synthase domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LMFYA]-R-x(3)-F-x(2)-[KRQ]-x(2)-W-x-[LIVM]-x(6,9)-E-x-D-
                    x-[FY]-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
