* RNA polymerases M / 15 Kd subunits signature *
************************************************

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing  different sets of genes. Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

It has  recently been shown [1,2] that small subunits of about 15 Kd, found in
polymerase types  I  and II, are highly conserved. Subunits known to belong to
this family are:

 - Yeast RPA12 subunit from RNA polymerases I.
 - Yeast RPB9 subunit from RNA polymerase II.
 - Yeast RPC11 subunit from RNA polymerase III.
 - Mammalian RPB14.5 (gene POLR2I) from RNA polymerase II.
 - Drosophila RpII15 from RNA polymerase II.
 - Archebacterial RNA polymerase subunit M (gene rpoM).

These proteins  contain  a probable zinc finger in their N-terminal region and
a C-terminal  zinc ribbon domain (see <PDOC00383>). As a signature pattern for
these subunits, we selected the region that contains the zinc finger.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-C-x-[DEKSTG]-C-[GNK]-[DNSA]-[LIVMHG]-[LIVM]-x(8,14)-
                    C-x(1,2)-C
                    [The four C's are putative zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
