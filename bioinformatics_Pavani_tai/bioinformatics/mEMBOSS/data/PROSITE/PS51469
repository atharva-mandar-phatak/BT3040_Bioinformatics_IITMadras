* SUN domain profile *
**********************

Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN)-domain  proteins  are  inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins
that are  part  of  bridging  complexes linking cytoskeletal elements with the
nucleoskeleton. Originaly  identified  based  on  an ~150-amino acid region of
homology between  the C terminus of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sad1 protein
and the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-84 protein, SUN proteins are present in the
proteomes of  most  eucaryotes.  In addition to the SUN domain, these proteins
contain a  transmembrane  sequence  and  at  least  one coiled-coil domain and
localize to the inner nuclear envelope. SUN proteins are anchored in the inner
nuclear envelope  by  their transmembrane segment and oriented in the membrane
such that  the C-terminal SUN domain is located in the space between the inner
and outer  nuclear  membrane.  Here,  the  SUN domain can interact with the C-
terminal tail  of  an  outer  nuclear  envelope  protein  that  binds  to  the
cytoskeleton, including the centrosome [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a SUN domain are listed below:

 - Fission yeast spindle pole body-associated protein Sad1.
 - Yeast  spindle  pole  body  assembly  component MPS3, essential for nuclear
   division and fusion.
 - Yeast uncharacterized protein SLP1.
 - Caenorhabditis nuclear migration and anchoring protein UNC-84.
 - Caenorhabditis   SUN  domain-containing  protein  1  (sun-1),  involved  in
   centrosome attachment to the nucleus.
 - Mammalian  sperm-associated  antigen  4  protein  (SPAG4),  may  assist the
   organization and   assembly  of  outer  dense  fibers  (ODFs),  a  specific
   structure of the sperm tail.
 - Mammalian sperm-associated antigen 4-like protein (SPAG4L).
 - Mammalian SUN1.
 - Mammalian SUN2.
 - Mammalian SUN3.

The profile we developed covers the entire SUN domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
