* Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase signature *
**************************************

Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase  (EC 5.4.99.2)  (MCM)  [1]  is  an  adenosylcobalamin
(vitamin B12)  dependent  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  isomerization  between
methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA.   MCM is  involved in various catabolic or
biosynthetic pathways; for example in man it is involved in the degradation of
several amino acids, odd-chain  fatty acids  and cholesterol via propionyl-CoA
to the tricarboxylic acid cycle; while in some bacteria it is involved  in the
synthesis of propionate from tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates.

Deficiency of MCM in  man  causes  an  often  fatal  disorder  of organic acid
metabolism termed methylmalonic acidemia.

In eukaryotes MCM is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is a homodimer of
a polypeptide  chain  of  about 710 amino acids. In bacteria MCM is a dimer of
two non-identical, yet structurally related chains.

The sequences  of  eukaryotic and prokaryotic MCM  are  rather well conserved.
This family  also  includes  an  Escherichia  coli  protein  (gene  sbm) whose
function is not yet known.

As a signature pattern  we selected the best conserved region which is located
in the central part of these sequences.

-Consensus pattern: R-I-A-R-N-[TQ]-x(2)-[LIVMFY](2)-x-[EQH]-E-x(4)-[KRN]-x(2)-
                    D-P-x-[GSA]-G-S
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for meaA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: A small degree of similarity is said [2]  to  exist between MCM and the
 large subunit of the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme ethanolamine ammonia-
 lyase, but this similarity is so weak  that these two type of enzymes can not
 be detected by a single pattern.

-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
