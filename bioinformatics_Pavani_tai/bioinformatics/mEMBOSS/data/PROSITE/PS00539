* Pyrokinins signature *
************************

Pyrokinins are insect neuropeptides that mediate  visceral  muscle contractile
activity (myotropic  activity)  [1].  The  pyrokinins  are peptides of 8 to 16
amino acids  that share the amide-blocked C-terminal sequence Phe-Xaa-Pro-Arg-
Leu-NH2, where  Xaa  is  either  Gly,  Ser, Thr, or Val.  This pentapeptide is
sufficient  to  elicit a significant myotropic activity.   The same C-terminal
sequence is present in the following insect neuropeptides:

 - Pheromone biosynthesis activating  neuropeptide (PBAN).  PBAN  is a hormone
   that controls    sex    pheromone  production  in  female moths  as well as
   eliciting pyrokinin-like myotropic activity.
 - Pheromonotropin [2], from Pseudaletia separata,  which  also  controls  sex
   pheromone production.
 - Bombyx mori diapause hormone (DH).

-Consensus pattern: F-[GSTV]-P-R-L-[G>]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.

-Note: If the  sequence  is  processed,  the  peptide  ends  with a C-terminal
 amidated Leu while  in a precursor  sequence  it  is always followed by a Gly
 which subsequently provides the amide group.
