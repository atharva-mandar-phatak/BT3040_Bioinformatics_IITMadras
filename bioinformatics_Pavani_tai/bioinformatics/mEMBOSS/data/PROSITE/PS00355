* HMG14 and HMG17 signature *
*****************************

High mobility group (HMG) proteins  are a  family of  relatively low molecular
weight non-histone components in chromatin.  HMG14 and  HMG17 [1], two related
proteins of about  100  amino  acid residues,  bind  to  the inner side of the
nucleosomal DNA thus altering the interaction between the DNA and  the histone
octamer. These two proteins may  be  involved  in  the process which maintains
transcribable genes in a unique chromatin conformation.

The trout nonhistone chromosomal  protein H6 (histone T)  also belongs to this
family.

As a signature pattern we selected a  conserved stretch of 10 residues located
in the N-terminal section of HMG14 and HMG17.

-Consensus pattern: [RQ]-R-S-A-[RS]-L-S-A-[RKM]-[PL]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
