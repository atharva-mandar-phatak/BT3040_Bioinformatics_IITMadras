*************************************************

Prokaryotic ribonuclease  III  (EC  3.1.26.3) (gene rnc) [1] is an enzyme that
digests double-stranded RNA. It is involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA
precursors and  of  some  mRNAs.  RNase III is evolutionary related [2] to the
following proteins:

 - Fission  yeast  pac1,  a  ribonuclease  that  probably  inhibits mating and
   meiosis by degrading a specific mRNA required for sexual development.
 - Yeast ribonuclease III  (gene RNT1), a dsRNA-specific nuclease that cleaves
   eukaryotic preribosomal RNA at various sites.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F26E4.13.
 - Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 protein A464R.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0346.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC8A4.08c, a protein with a N-terminal
   helicase domain and a C-terminal RNase III domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  protein  K12H4.8, a protein with the
   same structure as SpAC8A4.08c.

These proteins share regions of sequence similarity; one  of which is a highly
conserved stretch of 9 residues which we use as a signature pattern.
