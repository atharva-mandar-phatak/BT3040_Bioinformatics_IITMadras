* Ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) repeat profile *
****************************************************

Covalent modification of proteins by the small, evolutionary conserved protein
ubiquitin (see  <PDOC00271>)  plays  a  central  role in a variety of cellular
processes, including  bulk  protein  degradation,  cell-cycle  control, stress
response, DNA  repair,  signal  transduction,  transcriptional  regulation and
vesicular traffic. A cascade of three enzymes (called E1, E2 and E3) catalyzes
the conjugation  of  ubiquitin  to  lysine  side-chains  of  target  proteins.
Ubiquitination is  a  reversible  process: several specific ubiquitin carboxy-
terminal hydrolases   (UBPs)  (see  <PDOC00750>)  can  remove  ubiquitin  from
proteins. The  variety  of  cellular  processes  regulated  by  ubiquitination
demands a  high  substrate specificity of the ubiquitination machinery as well
as the  existence  of  diverse  downstream  effector proteins interacting with
ubiquitinated substrates.  Most  of these cellular effectors are characterized
by a  modular  composition  of  ubiquitin-binding  motifs  and further domains
mediating specific functions.

The ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), or 'LALAL-motif', is a stretch of about
20 amino  acid  residues,  which  was  first  described  in the 26S proteasome
subunit PSD4/RPN-10 that is known to recognize ubiquitin [1]. In addition, the
UIM is  found,  often  in  tandem  or triplet arrays, in a variety of proteins
either involved  in  ubiquitination  and  ubiquitin  metabolism,  or  known to
interact with  ubiquitin-like  modifiers.  Among  the  UIM  proteins  are  two
different subgroups  of  the UBP family of deubiquitinating enzymes, one F-box
protein, one  family  of  HECT-containing ubiquitin-ligases (E3s) from plants,
and several  proteins  containing ubiquitin-associated UBA and/or UBX domains.
In most  of  these  proteins,  the  UIM  occurs  in  multiple  copies  and  in
association with  other  domains  such  as  UBA  (see  <PDOC50030>),  UBX (see
<PDOC50033>), ENTH,  EH  (see  <PDOC50031>),  VHS  (see <PDOC50179>), SH3 (see
<PDOC50002>), HECT (see <PDOC50237>), VWFA (see <PDOC50234>), EF-hand calcium-
binding (see  <PDOC50031>),  WD-40 (see <PDOC00574>), F-box (see <PDOC50181>),
LIM (see   <PDOC00382>),   protein  kinase  (see  <PDOC00100>),  ankyrin  (see
<PDOC50088>), PX  (see <PDOC50195>), phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase (see
<PDOC00710>), C2   (see   <PDOC00380>),   OTU  (see  <PDOC50802>),  dnaJ  (see
<PDOC00553>), RING-finger  (see <PDOC00449>) or FYVE-finger (see <PDOC50178>).
UIMs have  been  shown  to bind ubiquitin and to serve as a specific targeting
signal important for monoubiquitination. Thus, UIMs may have several functions
in ubiquitin  metabolism  each  of which may require different numbers of UIMs
[3,4,5].

The UIM  is  unlikely to form an independent folding domain. Instead, based on
the spacing  of the conserved residues, the motif probably forms a short alpha
helix that can be embedded into different protein folds [1].

Some proteins known to contain an UIM are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic  PSD4/RPN-10/S5a  multiubiquitin  binding  subunit  of  the  26S
   proteasome.
 - Vertebrate  Machado-Joseph  disease  protein  1  (Ataxin-3).  It  acts as a
   histone-binding protein  that  regulates  transcription.  In human, defects
   Ataxin-3 the  cause  of  Machado-Joseph  disease (MJD), a neurodegenerative
   disorder characterized  by  cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal
   signs, peripheral  nerve palsy, external ophtalmoplegia, facial and lingual
   fasciculation and bulging.
 - Vertebrate epsin and epsin2.
 - Vertebrate  hepatocyte  growth  factor-regulated  tyrosine kinase substrate
   (HRS).
 - Mammalian  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  substrate 15 (EPS15). It is
   involved in cell growth regulation.
 - Mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor substrate EPS15R.
 - Drosophila melanogaster liquid facets (lqf), an epsin.
 - Yeast  VPS27  vacuolar sorting protein. It is required for membrane traffic
   to the vacuole.

The profile we developed covers the entire UIM.
