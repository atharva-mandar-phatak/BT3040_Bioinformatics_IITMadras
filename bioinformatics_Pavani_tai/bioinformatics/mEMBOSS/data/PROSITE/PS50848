* START domain profile *
************************

The StAR-related  lipid-transfer  (START)  domain  is an about 200-210 residue
lipid-binding motif,  which  is  primarily  involved  in  eukaryotic signaling
mediated by  lipid  binding.  Representatives  of the START domain family have
been shown  to  bind  different  ligands  such  as  sterols (StAR protein) and
phosphatidylcholine (PC-TP).  Ligand  binding  by  the  START  domain can also
regulate the  activities  of other domains that co-occur with the START domain
in multidomain  proteins  such  as Rho-GAP, the homeodomain (see <PDOC00027>),
and the thioesterase domain [1,2].

The crystal structure of START domain of human MLN64 (see <PDB:1EM2>) shows an
alpha/beta fold   built   around  an  U-shaped  incomplete  beta-barrel.  Most
importantly, the  interior of the protein encompasses a 26 x 12 x 11 Angstroms
hydrophobic tunnel   that   is  apparently  large  enough  to  bind  a  single
cholesterol molecule  [3,4]. The START domain structure revealed an unexpected
similarity to  that  of  the  birch  pollen  allergen Bet v 1 and to bacterial
polyketide cyclases/aromatases [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a START domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  steroidogenic  acute regulatory protein (StAR) orthologues. StAR
   can somehow   mediate  cholesterol  transfer  to  the  inner  mitochondrial
   membrane. In  human,  mutations  in  the  gene  that  encodes  StAR  causes
   congenital adrenal hyperplasia (lipoid CAH).
 - Mammalian phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP).
 - Mammalian RHOA-specific GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP).
 - Mammalian Goodpasture antigen binding protein.
 - Vertebrate acyl-CoA thioesterase.
 - Plant proteins from the Glabra2 (Gla2) family. The Gla2 homeodomain protein
   is involved in regulating trichome morphogenesis and root-hair development.
 - Dictyostelium  discoideum  CheaterA  (ChtA)  protein. Mutations in the gene
   that encodes  ChtA  induce the preferential formation of spores rather than
   stalk.
 - Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypothetical protein PA1579. This protein is closely
   related to  the  animal  PC-binding  proteins,  which  suggests  horizontal
   acquisition from  animals.  It  seems  likely that the START domain of this
   protein plays a role in the interaction of the bacterium with animal cells.

The profile we developed covers the entire START domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
