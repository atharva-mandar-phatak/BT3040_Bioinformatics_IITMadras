*********************************
* Zinc finger CCHC-type profile *
*********************************

The  18  residues CCHC zinc finger is mainly found in the nucleocapsid protein
of  retrovirus.  It  is  required  for  viral  genome  packaging and for early
infection  process  [1,2]. It is also found in eukaryotic proteins involved in
RNA binding or single-stranded DNA binding.

Some proteins known to contain a CCHC zinc finger are listed below.

 - Retroviral GAG protein. Nucleocapside protein.
 - Human  CNBP protein. CNBP is involved in sterol-mediated repression. It has
   also been  shown  to  bind the 5' untranslated region of ribosomal proteins
   mRNA (a region known to be important in translational regulation).
 - Yeast BYR3; the CNBP homolog.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans  protein glh-1; a probable ATP-binding RNA helicase.
 - Leishmania   major   hexamer-binding   protein  (HEXP).  It  binds  the  5'
   untranslated region of the GP63 gene.
 - Tobbacco transposon TNT1  PolX protein. Retrovirus-related pol polyprotein.

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
