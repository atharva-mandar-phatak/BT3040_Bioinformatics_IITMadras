RNA-directed  RNA  polymerase  (RdRp)  (EC  2.7.7.48)  is an essential protein
encoded  in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [1,2].
It  catalyses  synthesis  of  the  RNA  strand  complementary  to  a given RNA
template,  but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. The postulated
RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of
RNA  synthesis  begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a
primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the
addition  of  a  nucleotide  tri-phosphate  (NTP)  to  the  3'-OH of the first
initiating   NTP.  During  the  following  so-called  elongation  phase,  this
nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the
complementary RNA product [3].

All  the  RNA-directed  RNA  polymerases,  and  many DNA-directed polymerases,
employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a right hand
with  three  subdomains  termed  fingers, palm and thumb (see <PDB:1RDR>) [4].
Only  the  palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet
with two alpha-helices, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. In RdRp,
the palm subdomain comprises three well conserved motifs (A, B and C). Motif A
(D-x(4,5)-D)  and  motif C (GDD) are spatially juxtaposed; the Asp residues of
these  motifs  are implied in the binding of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+. The Asn residue
of  motif  B  is  involved  in  selection of ribonucleoside triphosphates over
dNTPs and thus determines whether RNA is synthesized rather than DNA [5].

RNA  viruses with no DNA stage can be placed in three main categories based on
their replication and coding strategies: positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA),
negative   ssRNA   and  double-stranded  RNA  (dsRNA)  viruses.  To  recognize
RNA-directed RNA polymerase we have developed six profiles that roughly follow
this  classification  (see below). They are all directed against the catalytic
region (palm subdomain).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile:    ALL
 positive   ssRNA   viruses,   two   small  families  of  dsRNA  viruses:  the
 Partitiviridae  and  the  Totoviridae  and  some  eukaryotic RdRps.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile:   ALL
 bacteriophages RdRps.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the third profile:    ALL
 RdRps of the Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the fourth profile:   ALL
 RdRps of the Birnaviridae family of dsRNA viruses.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the fifth profile:    ALL
 RdRps  of negative ssRNA viruses with segmented genomes except the ophiovirus
 and the varicovirus.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the sixth profile:    ALL
 RdRps   of  negative  ssRNA  viruses  with  non-segmented  genomes  plus  the
 ophiovirus and the varicovirus.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The GDD motif lacks in Birnaviridae RNA-directed RNA polymerases [6].
