* CRC domain profile *
**********************

The following  proteins  of  the tesmin/TSO1 family contain two cysteines-rich
repeats with  the consensus C-X-C-X(4)-C-X(3)-Y-C-X-C-X(6)-C-X(3)-C-X-C-X(2)-C
separated by  a  region  of  variable  length  containing  the short conserved
sequence R-N-P-X-A-F-X-P-K:

 - Animal  tesmin or MTL5, originally identified by its specific expression in
   testes, but  subsequently  it was also detected at specific stages of ovary
   development.
 - Animal tesmin-like (tesl) or LIN54.
 - Drosophila  melanogaster  tombola (tomb), a meiotic arrest protein which is
   expressed specifically in testis.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana TSO1, 'tso' means 'ugly' in Chinese and refers to the
   appearance of tso1 mutant flowers.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana TSO1-like 1 and 2 (SOL1 and SOL2).
 - Legume  Cysteine-rich Polycomb-like Protein 1 (CPP1), a DNA-binding protein
   acting as a negative regulator of the leghemoglobin gene.

This domain has been named the CRC domain (C1-RNPXAFXPK-C2). It binds zinc and
is able to bind DNA [1,2,3,4,5].

The CRC domain shows some similarity to the CXC domain found in the E(z)-type
of Polycomb group proteins (see <PDOC51633>) [6]. However, a clear distinction
can be made since the CXC domain lacks the RNPXAFXPK motif.

The profile we developed covers the entire CRC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
