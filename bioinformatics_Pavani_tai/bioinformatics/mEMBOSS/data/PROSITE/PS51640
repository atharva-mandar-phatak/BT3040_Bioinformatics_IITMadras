* MRG domain profile *
**********************

MORF4 (mortality  factor  on  chromosome  4),  MRG15  (MORF4-related  gene  on
chromosome 15)  and  MRGX  (MORF4-related gene on chromosome X) are members of
the MRG  protein  family  that  were first identified as transcription factors
involved in  cellular  senescence. All expressed members of the MRG family are
localized to the nucleus and have predicted motifs that indicate they function
as chromatin  remodeling  complex  components.  MORF4,  MRG15 and MRGX share a
common C-terminal  part  but  a  different  N-terminal  part.  The  C-terminal
similarity of  all MRG family members (MORF4, MRG15 and MRGX homologs) defines
a new  conserved  protein  domain.  The  ~170  amino  acid  MRG domain binds a
plethora of   transcriptional  regulators  and  chromatin-remodeling  factors,
including the  histone  deacetylase  transriptional corepressor mSin3A and the
nuclear protein PAM14 (protein-associated MRG, 14kDa) [1,2].

The MRG  domain  consists  of  three  conserved  blocks.  It  is predominantly
hydrophobic, and consists of mainly alpha-helices that are arranged in a three
layer sandwich  topology  (see <PDB:2F5J>). The hydrophobic core is stabilized
by interactions   among  a  number  of  conserved  hydrophobic  residues.  The
molecular surface  is  largely  hydrophobic,  but  contains  a few hydrophilic
patches [3,4,5].

The profile we developed covers the entire MRG domain.
