* Acyltransferases ChoActase / COT / CPT family signatures *
************************************************************

A number of eukaryotic acetyltransferases  can  be,  on  the basis of sequence
similarities, grouped together into a family. These enzymes are:

 - Choline o-acetyltransferase  (EC 2.3.1.6)   (ChoAcTase), an   enzyme   that
   catalyzes the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [1].
 - Carnitine o-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) [2].
 - Peroxisomal carnitine octanoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-)  (COT), a fatty acid
   beta-oxidation pathway enzyme which is involved in the transport of medium-
   chain acyl-coenzyme A's from peroxisome to mitochondria [3].
 - Mitochondrial  carnitine  O-palmitoyltransferases  I  and  II (EC 2.3.1.21)
   (CPT), enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and transport [4].
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER024w.
 - Mycoplasma pneumoniae putative acetyltransferase C09_orf600.

These enzymes  share  many  regions  of  sequence  similarities.  As signature
patterns we  selected  two of these regions.  The  first one,  located  in the
N-terminal section of  these enzymes is characterized by the presence of three
[LIVM]-P dipeptides. The second region, located in the central  part  of these
enzymes is  characterized  by the conservation of a number of charged residues
including an  histidine  which  probably plays a crucial role in the catalytic
mechanism [5].
