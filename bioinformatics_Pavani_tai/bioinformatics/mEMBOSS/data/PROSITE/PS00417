* Synaptobrevin signature *
***************************

Synaptobrevin [1] is an intrinsic membrane  protein of small synaptic vesicles
whose function is  not  yet known, but  which is highly  conserved in mammals,
electric ray  (where  its  is  known as VAMP-1),  Drosophila and yeast [2]. In
yeast there  are  two  closely  related forms of synaptobrevin (genes SNC1 and
SNC2) while in mammals there is at least 4 (genes SYB1, SYB2, SYB3 and SYBL1).

Structurally synaptobrevin  consist of a N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of from
90 to 110 residues,  followed  by  a transmembrane region, and then by a short
(from 2 to 22 residues) C-terminal intravesicular domain.

As a  signature  pattern  for  synaptobrevin  we  selected  a highly conserved
stretch of residues located in the central part of the sequence.

-Consensus pattern: [NT]-[LIVMF]-[DENSTG]-[KLNRGS]-[VAI]-x-[DEQA]-R-x(2)-
                    [KRN]-[LIVM]-[STDEA]-x-[LIVM]-x-[DEQGN]-[KR]-[TAS]-[DEAS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
