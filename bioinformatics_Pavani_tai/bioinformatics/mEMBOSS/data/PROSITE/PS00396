***********************************************

DNA topoisomerase  I (EC 5.99.1.2) [1,2,3,4] is one of the two types of enzyme
that catalyze   the   interconversion  of  topological  DNA  isomers.  Type  I
topoisomerases act  by catalyzing the transient breakage of DNA, one strand at
a time, and the subsequent rejoining of the strands. When a prokaryotic type I
topoisomerase breaks  a DNA backbone bond, it  simultaneously forms a protein-
DNA link  where  the hydroxyl  group  of a tyrosine residue is joined to a 5'-
phosphate on DNA, at one end of the enzyme-severed DNA strand.

Prokaryotic organisms, such as Escherichia coli, have two type I topoisomerase
isozymes: topoisomerase  I  (gene  topA)  and  topoisomerase  III (gene topB).
Eukaroytes also contain homologs of prokaryotic topoisomerase III.

There are a  number of conserved residues in the region around the active site
tyrosine; we used this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [EQ]-x-L-Y-[DEQSTLM]-x(3,12)-[LIVST]-[ST]-Y-x-R-[ST]-
                    [DEQSN]
                    [The second Y is the active site tyrosine]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
