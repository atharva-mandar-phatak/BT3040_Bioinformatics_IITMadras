* DFDF domain and FFD and TFG boxes profiles *
**********************************************

Sm and  Sm-like  proteins  of  the RNA-binding Lsm (like Sm) domain family are
found in  all  domains  of  life  and are generally involved in important RNA-
processing tasks.  Lsm13-16 homologs share a domain organization consisting of
a divergent  N-terminal Lsm domain and a central or C-terminal consensus motif
DFDF-x(7)-F closely  preceded  and  followed  by  further  phenylalanines  and
charged aspartates/glutamates  and  arginines/lysines/histidines. The variable
seven-residue tract  of this consensus motif usually contains an asparagine at
the third  or  fourth  position except of one sequence where the asparagine is
replaced by  a  glycine. In few other sequences, the DFDF box is replaced by a
DYDF or  EFDF  box  [1]. The DFDF domain is a heterodimerization domain, which
adopts a helical conformation upon binding (see <PDB:2WAX>). It folds into two
consecutive alpha  helices  that  are  preceded and connected by the FDF and a
related FDK sequence [2].

Two other  strongly  conserved FFD box and TFG box sequence motifs Y-x-K-x(3)-
FFD-x-[IL]-S and   [RKH]-x(2,5)-E-x(0-2)-[RK]-x(3,4)-[DE]-TFG   contained   in
Lsm13-15, but  not  Lsm16, homologs succeed the DFDF-x(7)-F motif and are also
predicted to be of helical nature [1].

The profiles we developed cover the entire DFDF domain and FFD and TFG boxes.
