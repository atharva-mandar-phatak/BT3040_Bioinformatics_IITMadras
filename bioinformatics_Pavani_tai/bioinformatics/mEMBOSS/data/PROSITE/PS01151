* Fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher protein signature *
**************************************************************

In Gram-negative bacteria the biogenesis of fimbriae (or pili) requires a two-
component assembly  and  transport  system  which is composed of a periplasmic
chaperone (see  <PDOC00552>)  and  an  outer  membrane  protein which has been
termed a  molecular  'usher'  [1,2,3]. The protein is rather large (from 86 to
100 Kd) and seems to be mainly composed  of  membrane-spanning  beta-sheets, a
structure reminiscent  of  porins.  Known  members  of  this family are listed
below:

 - Escherichia coli papC for P pili.
 - Escherichia coli afaC for AFA-III adhesin.
 - Escherichia coli aggC for AAF/I fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli cssD for CS6 antigen.
 - Escherichia coli faeD for K88 pili.
 - Escherichia coli fanD for K99 pili.
 - Escherichia coli fasD for 987P fimbria.
 - Escherichia coli fimD for type 1 fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli focD for F1C fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli htrE for a yet unknown pilin.
 - Escherichia coli CS3-2 for CS3 pili.
 - Bordetella  pertussis  fhaA  (or  fimC)  for  filamentous hemagglutinin and
   fimbria.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hifC for type b pili.
 - Klebsiella pneumoniae mrkC for type 3 pili.
 - Proteus mirabilis pmfC for PMF fimbriae.
 - Salmonella enteritidis sefC for sef14 fimbriae.
 - Salmonella typhimurium lpfC for long polar fimbriae.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica myfC for myf fimbriae.
 - Yersinia pestis caf1A for F1 capsule antigen.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybgQ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycbS.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yehB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfcU.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhcD.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yqiG.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yraJ.

The degree of sequence similarity of these proteins is not very high.  However
they  share a number of characteristics. One them is the presence of two pairs
of cysteines, the first one  is  located in the N-terminal part and the second
at the  C-terminal  extremity.  They are probably involved in disulfide bonds.
The best conserved region is located in the central part of these proteins and
can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [VL]-[PASQ]-[PAS]-G-[PAD]-[FY]-x-[LI]-[DNQSTAP]-[DNH]-
                    [LIVMFY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for cssD and sefC.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
