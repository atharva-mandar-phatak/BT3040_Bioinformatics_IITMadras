* Conotoxin families signatures *
*********************************

Cone snail toxins, conotoxins, are small peptides with disulfide connectivity,
that target  ion-channels  or G-protein coupled receptors. Based on the number
and pattern  of  disulfide  bonds and biological activities, conotoxins can be
classified into  several  families  [1].  Omega,  delta  and kappa families of
conotoxins have  a  knottin  or  inhibitor  cystine knot scaffold. The knottin
scaffold is a very special disulfide through disulfide knot, in which the III-
VI disulfide  bond  crosses the macrocycle formed by two other disulfide bonds
(I-IV and   II-V)  and  the  interconnecting  backbone  segments,  where  I-VI
indicates the six cysteine residues starting from the N-terminus [2,E1].

Conotoxins represent   a   unique  arsenal  of  neuropharmacologically  active
peptides that  have  been  evolutionarily tailored to afford unprecedented and
exquisite selectivity  for  a wide variety of ion-channel subtypes. The toxins
derived from cone snails are currently being investigated for the treatment of
chronic pain,  epilepsy,  cardiovascular  diseases,  psychiatric  and movement
disorders, spasticity,  cancer, stroke as well as an anesthetic agent. Several
potential analgesic  and  anti-inflammatory  peptides  from conotoxin families
have been identified and patented [3,4]:

 - Conus magus omega-conotoxin MVIIa (Ziconotide) is used for the treatment of
   chronic pain.
 - Conus  catus  omega-conotoxin  CVID is tested for treating severe morphine-
   resistant pain stress.
 - Conus  geographus  omega-conotoxin  GVIA  may  exert  antagonistic  effects
   against beta-endorphin induced anti-nociception.

The disulfide  bonding  network  as  well  as  specific  amino acids in inter-
cysteine loops provide specificity of conotoxins [5]. The cysteine arrangement
[C-C-CC-C-C] is  the same for omega and delta families, which belong to the O-
superfamily. The  omega conotoxins are calcium channel blockers, whereas delta
conotoxins delay the inactivation of sodium channels [1]. The M-superfamily Mu
conotoxins have   two   types   of   cysteine   arrangement   [CC-C-C-CC]  and
[CC-C-C-C-C], but  knottin  scaffold is not observed. Mu conotoxins target the
voltage-gated sodium  channels  [1]  and  are  useful probes for investigating
voltage-dependent sodium  channels  of excitable tissues [6]. Alpha conotoxins
belong to  the  A-superfamily  and  have  two  types  of  cysteine arrangement
[CC-C-C] and  [CCC-C-C-C]  [7].  Alpha  conotoxins  are  competitive nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor   antagonists.   The  I-superfamily  of  conotoxins  is
characterized by a pattern of eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide
bridges. The  arrangement  of  cysteine residues is similar to the Janus-faced
atracotoxin peptides characterized from spider venoms (see <PDOC60020>) [8,9].

Three signature  patterns  were  developed  for  omega, delta and mu conotoxin
families. The  patterns  each  include  six  conserved cysteines thought to be
important for  the maintenance of the tertiary structure of the conotoxins. We
have defined  a  pattern  for  the  common  part  of  the cysteine arrangement
[CC-C-C] in  all  members of alpha conotoxin family. The pattern includes four
conserved cysteines  thought  to  be  important  for  the  maintenance  of the
tertiary structure  of  alpha  conotoxins.  The  pattern for the I-superfamily
conotoxin covers the eight conserved cysteines.
