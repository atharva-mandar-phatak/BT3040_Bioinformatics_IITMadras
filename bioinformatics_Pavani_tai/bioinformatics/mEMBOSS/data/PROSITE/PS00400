* LBP / BPI / CETP family signature *
*************************************

The following  mammalian  lipid-binding serum glycoproteins belong to the same
family [1,2,3]:

 - Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP).  LBP binds to the lipid A  moiety
   of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present  in  the outer
   membrane of  all  Gram-negative bacteria.  The  LBP/LPS  complex  seems  to
   interact with the CD14 receptor and may be responsible for the secretion of
   alpha-TNF.
 - Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Like LBP, BPI binds LPS
   and has a cytotoxic activity on Gram-negative bacteria.
 - Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP is involved in the transfer
   of insoluble cholesteryl esters in reverse cholesterol transport.
 - Phospholipid  transfer protein (PLTP). May play a key role in extracellular
   phospholipid transport and modulation of HDL particles.

These proteins are structurally related  and  share  many  regions of sequence
similarities.  As a signature pattern  we  have selected one of these regions,
which is located in  the N-terminal  section of these proteins; a region which
could be involved in the binding to the lipids [2].

                    x(4)-[LIVM]-[EQK]-x(8)-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
