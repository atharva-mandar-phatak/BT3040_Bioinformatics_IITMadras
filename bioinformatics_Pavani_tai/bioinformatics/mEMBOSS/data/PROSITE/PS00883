**********************************************************************

Bacterial membrane-bound  nickel-dependent hydrogenases  [1,2,3]  seem  to  be
associated with  a  b-type  cytochrome  involved  in  electron  transfer  from
hydrogen to  oxygen. This cytochrome is a protein of about 28 Kd that seems to
have four  transmembrane  regions.  The  gene  coding  for  this cytochrome is
adjacent to that coding for the large subunit of the hydrogenase.  It has been
assigned a variety of names in different species: hupC, hyaC, hydC or hoxZ.

We developed two signature patterns for this protein. The first corresponds to
the first potential transmembrane region. The second signature includes the C-
terminal part  of  a  hydrophilic  loop  between  the  third  and  the  fourth
transmembrane region  as  well  as  the first half of the fourth transmembrane
region. Both signatures contain conserved histidines that could be involved in
binding the heme iron group.

-Consensus pattern: R-[LIVMFYW]-x-H-W-[LIVM]-x(2)-[LIVMF]-[STAC]-[LIVM]-x(2)-
                    L-x-[LIVM]-T-G
                    [H may be a heme ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [RH]-[STA]-[LIVMFYW]-H-[RH]-[LIVM]-x(2)-W-x-[LIVMF]-x(2)-
                    F-x(3)-H
                    [The 2 H's may be heme ligands]
