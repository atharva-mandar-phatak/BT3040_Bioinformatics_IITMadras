* Arthropod CHH/MIH/GIH neurohormones family signature *
********************************************************

Arthropod  express  a family of neuropeptides [1] which so far  consist of the
following types of neurohormones:

 - Crustacean  hyperglycemic hormone (CHH). CHH is primarily involved in blood
   sugar regulation,  but  also  plays  a  role  in the control of molting and
   reproduction.
 - Molt-inhibiting  hormone (MIH). MIH inhibits Y-organs where molting hormone
   (ecdysteroid) is  secreted. A molting cycle is initiated when MIH secretion
   diminishes or stops.
 - Gonad-inhibiting  hormone  (GIH),  also  known as vitellogenesis-inhibiting
   hormone (VIH)  because  of  its role in inhibiting vitellogenesis in female
   animals.
 - Mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MOIH). MOIH represses the synthesis of
   methyl farnesoate,  the  precursor  of  insect  juvenile hormone III in the
   mandibular organ.
 - Ion  transport  peptide  (ITP)  from  locust. ITP stimulates salt and water
   reabsorption and inhibits acid secretion in the ileum of the locust.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZC168.2.

These neurohormones are peptides of 70 to 80 residues which are processed from
larger size precursors. They contain six conserved cysteines that are involved
in disulfide bonds, as shown in the following schematic representation.
