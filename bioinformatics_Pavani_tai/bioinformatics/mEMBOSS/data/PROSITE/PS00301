* GTP-binding elongation factors signature *
********************************************

Elongation factors  [1,2]  are proteins  catalyzing the  elongation of peptide
chains in protein biosynthesis. In both prokaryotes and  eukaryotes, there are
three  distinct types  of elongation  factors,  as  described in the following
table:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Eukaryotes   Prokaryotes   Function
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 EF-1alpha    EF-Tu         Binds GTP and  an aminoacyl-tRNA;  delivers  the
                            latter to the A site of ribosomes.
 EF-1beta     EF-Ts         Interacts with EF-1a/EF-Tu  to  displace GDP and
                            thus allows the regeneration of GTP-EF-1a.
 EF-2         EF-G          Binds GTP and peptidyl-tRNA and translocates the
                            latter from the A site to the P site.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GTP-binding elongation factor family also includes the following proteins:

 - Eukaryotic  peptide  chain  release  factor GTP-binding subunits [3]. These
   proteins interact  with  release  factors  that bind to ribosomes that have
   encountered a  stop  codon  at  their decoding site and help them to induce
   release of  the  nascent  polypeptide.  The yeast protein was known as SUP2
   (and also as SUP35, SUF12 or GST1) and the human homolog as GST1-Hs.
 - Prokaryotic  peptide  chain release factor 3 (RF-3) (gene prfC).  RF-3 is a
   class-II RF, a GTP-binding  protein  that  interacts  with class I RFs (see
   <PDOC00607>) and enhance their activity [4].
 - Prokaryotic GTP-binding protein lepA and its  homolog  in yeast (gene GUF1)
   and in Caenorhabditis elegans (ZK1236.1).
 - Yeast HBS1 [5].
 - Rat statin S1 [6], a protein of unknown function which is highly similar to
   EF-1alpha.
 - Prokaryotic selenocysteine-specific elongation factor selB [7], which seems
   to replace  EF-Tu  for  the insertion of selenocysteine directed by the UGA
   codon.
 - The tetracycline resistance proteins tetM/tetO [8,9] from various  bacteria
   such as  Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecalis,  Streptococcus mutans
   and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Tetracycline binds to the prokaryotic ribosomal
   30S subunit and inhibits binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs. These proteins abolish
   the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis.
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodQ [10].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihK [11].

In EF-1-alpha, a specific region  has  been  shown [12] to  be  involved  in a
conformational change mediated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This region is
conserved in  both EF-1alpha/EF-Tu as well as EF-2/EF-G and thus seems typical
for GTP-dependent proteins which bind non-initiator tRNAs to the ribosome. The
pattern we  developed  for  this  family  of  proteins  include that conserved
region.

-Consensus pattern: D-[KRSTGANQFYW]-x(3)-E-[KRAQ]-x-[RKQD]-[GC]-[IVMK]-[ST]-
                    [IV]-x(2)-[GSTACKRNQ]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 11 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
