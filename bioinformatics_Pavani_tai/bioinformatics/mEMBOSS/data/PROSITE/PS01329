* Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa signature *
**********************************************

Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) [1] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which
is a component  of  the  respiratory  chain  complex  and is involved   in the
transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen.   In eukaryotes this enzyme
complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes
it is found in the plasma membrane.  In  addition  to the three large subunits
that form the catalytic center of the enzyme complex there are, in eukaryotes,
a variable  number  of  small  polypeptidic subunits. One of these subunits is
known as  VIa  in  vertebrates  and  fungi.  Mammals  have two tissue-specific
isoforms of VIa, a liver and a heart form. Only one form is found is fish [2].

A signature  pattern for VIa was developed that is based on the best conserved
part of the protein, a region located in its C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-R-x-K-x-[FYW]-x-W-[GS]-D-G-x-[KH]-[ST]-x-F-x-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1999 / First entry.
