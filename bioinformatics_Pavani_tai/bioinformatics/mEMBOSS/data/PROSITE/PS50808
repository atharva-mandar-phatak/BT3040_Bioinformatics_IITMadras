* Zinc finger BED-type profile *
********************************

The BED finger which was named after the drosophila proteins BEAF and DREF, is
found in  one  or  more copies in cellular regulatory factors and transposases
from plants, animals and fungi. The BED finger is an about 50 to 60 amino acid
residues domain that contains a characteristic motif with two highly conserved
aromatic positions,  as  well  as a shared pattern of cysteines and histidines
that is  predicted  to  form a zinc finger. As diverse BED fingers are able to
bind DNA,  it  has  been suggested that DNA-binding is the general function of
this domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain a BED domain are listed below:

 - Animal, fungal and plant AC1 and Hobo-like transposases.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   protein   dpy-20,   a  predicted  cuticular-gene
   transcriptional regulator.
 - Drosophila  BEAF  (boundary element-associated factor), which is thought to
   be involved in chromatin insulation.
 - Drosophila DREF, a transcriptional regulator for S-phase genes.
 - Tobacco  3AF1 and tomato E4/E8-BP1, which are light- and ethylene-regulated
   DNA binding proteins that contain two BED fingers [2,3].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
