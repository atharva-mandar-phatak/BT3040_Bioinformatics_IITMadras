* BTG family signatures *
*************************

A novel   family  of  anti-proliferative  proteins  has  been  recently  [1,2]
characterized:

 - Mammalian  and  avian  protein BTG1. BTG1 seems to negatively regulate cell
   proliferation.
 - Mammalian protein BTG2 (also known as PC3 or TIS21).
 - Mammalian protein BTG3 (also known as TOB5).
 - Mammalian protein BTG4 (also known as PC3b).
 - Mammalian  protein  TOB,  an anti-proliferative protein that interacts with
   the erbb-2 receptor tyrosine kinase [3].
 - Human protein TOB4.
 - Xenopus  laevis  maternal  proteins B9.10 and B9.15 (which are probably the
   orthologs of BTG3).

The proteins  have  from  158 to 363 amino acid residues. BTG2 seems to have a
signal sequence; while the other proteins may lack such a domain. The sequence
of the  N-terminal  half  of  these  proteins  is well conserved. As signature
patterns, we  selected  the  two best conserved regions of these proteins. The
first signature pattern includes the only conserved cysteine.

-Consensus pattern: Y-x(2)-[HP]-W-[FYH]-[APS]-[DE]-x-P-x-K-G-x-[GA]-[FY]-R-C-
                    [IV]-[RH]-[IV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LV]-P-x-[DE]-[LM]-[ST]-[LIVM]-W-[IV]-D-P-x-E-V-[SC]-x-
                    [RQ]-x-G-[EK]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
