* RAP domain profile *
**********************

The ~60-residue   RAP   (an   acronym   for  RNA-binding  domain  abundant  in
Apicomplexans) domain  is  found  in  various  proteins  in  eucaryotes. It is
particularly abundant  in  apicomplexans and might mediate a range of cellular
functions through its potential interactions with RNA [1].

The RAP  domain  consists of multiple blocks of charged and aromatics residues
and is  predicted  to be composed of alpha helical and beta strand structures.
Two predicted  loop  regions  that  are  dominated  by  glycine and tryptophan
residues are found before and after the central beta sheet [1].

Some proteins known to contain a RAP domain are listed below:

 - Human hypothetical protein MGC5297.
 - Mammalian FAST kinase domain-containing proteins (FASTKDs).
 - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplastic trans-splicing factor Raa3.

The profile we developed covers the entire RAP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 2007 / First entry.
