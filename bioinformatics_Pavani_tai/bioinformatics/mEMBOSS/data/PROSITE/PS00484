* Thyroglobulin type-1 domain signature and profile *
*****************************************************

Thyroglobulin  (Tg)  is a large glycoprotein specific to the thyroid gland and
it  is  the  precursor  of  the  iodinated thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine  (T3).  The N-terminal section of Tg contains 11 repeats of a
domain  of  about 70 amino acids which is known as the Tg type-1 repeat [1-3].
Such  a  domain  has also been found (as a single or repeated sequence) in the
proteins listed below:

 - In the HLA class II associated invariant  chain [3].  In  that protein  the
   type-1 repeat is encoded by  an exon which is alternatively  spliced and is
   only present in a longer form of the protein.
 - In human pancreatic carcinoma marker proteins GA733-1 and GA733-2 (which is
   also known as epithelial  cell  surface antigen  (EPG)  or  adenocarcinoma-
   associated antigen (KSA) or antigen KS 1/4). These proteins may function as
   growth factor receptors [4].
 - In nidogen (entactin), a sulfated glycoprotein  which is widely distributed
   in basement membranes and that is tightly associated with laminin.  Nidogen
   probably has a role in cell-extracellular matrix interactions.
 - In  the  insulin-like  growth  factor  binding  proteins  (IGFBP)  [5] (see
   <PDOC00194>).
 - In saxiphilin, a transferrin-like protein from frog that binds specifically
   to the neurotoxin saxitoxin [6].
 - In equistatin, a thiol-protease inhibitor from sea anemone [7].

The  domain  contains six cysteines (Tg type-1a) involved in 3 disulfide bonds
(see  <PDB:1ZT3>)  [5],  but also exists in a variant that lacks the third and
fourth  cysteines  (Tg  type-1b).  One  Gln  residue  is  strongly  conserved.
Schematic representations of the two Tg type-1 domains are shown below:

'*': Position of the consensus pattern in the domain.

The  central part of the domain is well conserved, we have used this region as
a  signature  pattern for Tg type-1 domains. We also developed a profile which
covers the entire Tg type-1 domain.

-Consensus pattern: [FYWHPVAS]-x(3)-C-x(3,4)-[SG]-x-[FYW]-x(3)-Q-x(5,12)-
                    [FYW]-C-[VA]-x(3,4)-[SG]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 2 IGFBP-1 and -3 from mouse (where the conserved Gln is mutated to an Arg
 or Glu) and the third  and eighth  repeats from  thyroglobulin because of big
 insertions.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
