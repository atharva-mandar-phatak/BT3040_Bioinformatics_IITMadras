* Natriuretic peptides receptors signature *
********************************************

Natriuretic peptides  are  hormones  involved  in  the regulation of fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis. These hormones stimulate the intracellular production
of cyclic GMP as a second messenger.

Currently, three types of natriuretic peptide receptors are known [1,2].   Two
express guanylate  cyclase activity: GC-A (or ANP-A)  which  seems specific to
atrial  natriuretic  peptide  (ANP), and  GC-B (or ANP-B) which  seems  to  be
stimulated  more  effectively  by brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) than by ANP.
The third receptor (ANP-C) is  probably  responsible  for the clearance of ANP
from the circulation and does not play a role in signal transduction.

GC-A and GC-B are  plasma  membrane-bound  proteins  that  share the following
topology: an N-terminal extracellular domain  which acts as the ligand binding
region, then  a  transmembrane  domain  followed  by  a  large  cytoplasmic C-
terminal region that can be subdivided into two domains: a protein kinase-like
domain (see <PDOC00100>) that  appears important  for  proper signalling and a
guanylate cyclase catalytic domain (see <PDOC00425>). The topology of ANP-C is
different: like  GC-A  and  -B  it  possesses  an extracellular ligand-binding
region and a transmembrane domain, but its cytoplasmic domain is very short.

We developed  a pattern from the ligand-binding  region of natriuretic peptide
receptors based on a highly conserved region located in the N-terminal part of
the domain.

-Consensus pattern: G-P-x-C-x-Y-x-A-A-x-V-x-R-x(3)-H-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 1991 / First entry.
