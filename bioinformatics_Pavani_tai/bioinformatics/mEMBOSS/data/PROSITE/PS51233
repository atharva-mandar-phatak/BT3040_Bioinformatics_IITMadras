* VWFD domain profile *
***********************

Von  Willebrand  factor  (VWF)  is  a  large,  multimeric  blood  glycoprotein
synthesized  in  endothelial  cells  and  megakaryocytes, that is required for
normal  hemostasis.  Mutant  forms  are  involved in the most common inherited
bleeding  disorder (von Willebrand disease: VWD). VWF mediates the adhesion of
platelets to sites of vascular damage by binding to specific platelet membrane
glycoproteins  and  to  constituents  of exposed connective tissue. It is also
essential for the transport of the blood clotting factor VIII [1,2].

VWF  is  a  large  multidomain  protein.  The type D domain (VWFD) is not only
required   for  blood  clotting  factor  VIII  binding  but  also  for  normal
multimerization  of  VWF  [3,4]. The interaction between blood clotting factor
VIII and VWF is necessary for normal survival of blood clotting factor VIII in
blood circulation. The VWFD domain is a highly structured region, in which the
first  conserved Cys has been found to form a disulfide bridge with the second
conserved one [3,4].

The  VWFD domain can occur in association with a lot of different domains like
vitellogenin   (see   <PDOC51211>),   VWFC   (see   <PDOC00928>),   VWFA  (see
<PDOC50234>), and ZP (see <PDOC00577>).

Proteins with a VWFD domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  von  Willebrand factor (VWF), a multifunctional protein involved
   in  maintaining homeostasis. It consists of 4 VWFD domains, 3 VWFA domains,
   3  VWFB domains, 2 VWFC domains, an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot.
   There might be a third VWFC domain within the type B domain region [2].
 - Mammalian  zonadhesin, which binds in a species-specific manner to the zona
   pellucida of the egg.
 - Mammalian  bone  morphogenetic  protein-binding  (BMP-binding)  endothelial
   regulator protein.
 - Mammalian  alpha-tectorin,  which  is  one  of  the  major  non-collagenous
   components of the tectorial membrane.
 - Mammalian   mucins,  glycoproteins  that  are  major  constituents  of  the
   glycocalyx that covers mucosal epithelium.
 - Mammalian  vitellogenin,  a  major  lipoprotein  in many oviparous animals,
   which is a precursor of a lipid-binding product named as lipovitellin.

We developed a profile that spans the entire VWFD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
