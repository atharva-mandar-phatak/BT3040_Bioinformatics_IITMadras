* FtsK domain profile *
***********************

The FtsK  domain is a hydrophilic domain of about 200 residues, which is found
in:

 - Bacterial cell division protein ftsK  (known as sporulation protein SpoIIIE
   in Bacillus subtilis).
 - A  set of conjugative plasmid- and conjugative transposon-encoded proteins,
   generally called  Tra  proteins.  These proteins come from an extremly wide
   range of  species,  including  Gram-positive  and Gram-negative bacilli and
   cocci, Streptomyces  species,  Agrobacterium  spp.,  and archaebacteria. In
   cases in   which   a  function  is  known,  the  protein  is  required  for
   intercellular DNA transfer.

The FtsK  domain contains a highly conserved putative ATP-binding P-loop motif
(see <PDOC00017>)  and is assumed to be cytoplasmic. It can be found in one to
three copies  and  is  thought to be involved in DNA translocation by coupling
ATP hydrolysis to movement relative to the long axis of DNA [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire FtsK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
