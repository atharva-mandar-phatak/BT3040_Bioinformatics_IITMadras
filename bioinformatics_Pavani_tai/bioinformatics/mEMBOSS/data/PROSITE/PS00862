****************************************************

Some oxygen-dependent   oxidoreductases  are  flavoproteins  that  contains  a
covalently bound  FAD  group  which is attached to a histidine via an 8-alpha-
(N3-histidyl)-riboflavin linkage. These proteins are:

 - (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.6) (6-HDNO) [1], a bacterial enzyme
   that catalyzes  the  oxygen-dependent degradation of 6-hydroxynicotine into
   6-hydroxypyrid-N-methylosmine.
 - Plant   reticuline   oxidase  (EC 1.21.3.3) [2]   (berberine-bridge-forming
   enzyme), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of (S)-reticuline into (S)-
   scoulerine in the pathway leading to benzophenanthridine alkaloids.
 - L-gulonolactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.8)  (l-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase) [3],
   a mammalian enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of L-gulono-1,4-lactone to
   L-xylo-hexulonolactone which spontaneously isomerizes to L-ascorbate.
 - D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.24) (L-galactonolactone oxidase),
   a yeast enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of D-erythroascorbic acid [4].
 - Mitomycin  radical  oxidase  [5], a bacterial protein involved in mitomycin
   resistance and that probably oxidizes the reduced form of mitomycins.
 - Cytokinin oxidase (EC 1.4.3.18), a plant enzyme.
 - Rhodococcus fascians fasciation locus protein fas5.

The region around the histidine that binds the FAD group is conserved in these
enzymes and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: P-x(7)-{L}-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVM]-x(3)-[LIVM]-x(9,12)-[LIVM]-
                    x(3)-[GSA]-[GSTCHRQ]-G-H
                    [H is the FAD binding site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
