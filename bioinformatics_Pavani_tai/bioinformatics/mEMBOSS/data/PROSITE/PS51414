* HSR domain profile *
**********************

The following  proteins  share  a  nuclear dot (DT) targeting and dimerization
domain of ~100 amino acids  [1,2,3]:

 - Mammalian  nuclear  autoantigen  Sp-100,  a  constituent of nuclear domains
   known as  nuclear dots (NDs) or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. It may
   play a role in the control of gene expression.
 - Murine  Sp100-rs,  a  murine-truncated Sp-100 homologue, which is expressed
   from a  highly  amplified gene. In some mice strains, the amplification has
   progressed to  such  extremely  high  copy  numbers that the amplified gene
   locus is   visible   as  a  homogeneously  staining  region  (HSR)  on  the
   corresponding murine chromosome.
 - Mammalian nuclear body protein SP140-like or LySp100B protein.
 - Mammalian Sp110 nuclear body protein.
 - Vertebrate  AutoImmune  REgulator (AIRE) protein, a transcription regulator
   predominantly expressed   in   thymus   medullary   epithelial   cells.  It
   subcellularly localizes to nuclear dots.

As this domain comprises most of the sequence of the truncated murine Sp100-rs
protein, it  was  termed  HSR  domain [2]. The HSR domain, which has also been
named ASS  (AIRE, Sp-100 and Sp140) domain [3], can also be found N-terminally
in association  with other domains, such as SAND (see <PDOC50864>), PHD finger
(see <PDOC50016>)  and Bromo (see <PDOC00550>), The HSR domain is predicted to
be predominantly alpha-helical [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire HSR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
