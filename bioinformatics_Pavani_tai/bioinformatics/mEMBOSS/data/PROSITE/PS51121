* NtA (N-terminal agrin) domain profile *
*****************************************

Agrin  is involved in postsynaptic differentiation at the site of nerve-muscle
contact.  The  N-terminal  Agrin  (NtA) domain is a region of ~135 amino acids
required  for  the  localization  of  agrin to synaptic basal lamina and other
basement  membranes  [1].  Agrin is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan whereof the
NtA  domain  forms  the most N-terminal part, followed by 9 Kazal-like domains
and  2  LE  domains  (see  <PDOC00961>). The C-terminal part consists of a SEA
domain (see <PDOC50024>), 4 EGF-like domains (see <PDOC00021>) and 3 Laminin G
domains  (see  <PDOC50025>),  responsible  for the clustering of acetylcholine
receptors.  The NtA domain is the most highly conserved domain in agrin and it
binds with the coiled coil domain of laminins [2].

Tertiairy  structures  show  that  the  NtA domain folds as a beta-barrel core
flanked by N- and C-terminal helical regions (see <PDB:1PXU>). The core of the
domain  consists  of  5  beta-strands  that  form 2 beta-sheets. The structure
belongs  to  the  OB  fold  family  and  shows  similarity  with  the protease
inhibition  domain  of  TIMP-1,  suggesting alternative functions for agrin in
addition to synaptogenic activity [2,3]. Residues Leu 117 and Val 124 in helix
3 of the NtA domain are essential for binding to the laminin gamma1 chain [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire NtA (N-terminal agrin) domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
