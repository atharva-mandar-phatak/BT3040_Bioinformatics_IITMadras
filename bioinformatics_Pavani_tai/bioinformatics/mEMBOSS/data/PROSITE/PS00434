* HSF-type DNA-binding domain signature *
*****************************************

Heat shock factor (HSF) is a DNA-binding protein  that specifically binds heat
shock  promoter  elements (HSE).  HSE  is  a  palindromic  element  rich  with
repetitive purine and  pyrimidine motifs:  5'-nGAAnnTTCnnGAAnnTTCn-3'.  HSF is
expressed at normal  temperatures but is  activated  by heat shock or chemical
stressors [1,2]. The sequences  of  HSF  from  various  species show extensive
similarity in  a  region  of about 90 amino acids, which has been shown [3] to
bind DNA.

Some other proteins also contain a HSF domain, these are:

 - Yeast  SFL1,  a protein involved in cell surface assembly and regulation of
   the gene related to flocculation (asexual cell aggregation) [4].
 - Yeast  transcription  factor  SKN7  (or  BRY1  or POS9), which binds to the
   promoter elements  SCB  and  MCB  essential  for the controal of G1 cyclins
   expression [5].
 - Yeast MGA1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR147w.

We have  derived a pattern from the most conserved part of the HSF DNA-binding
domain, its central region.

-Consensus pattern: L-x(3)-[FY]-K-H-x-N-x-[STAN]-S-F-[LIVM]-R-Q-L-[NH]-x-Y-x-
                    [FYW]-[RKH]-K-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for YJR147w whose sequence in the HSF domain is quite divergent.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
