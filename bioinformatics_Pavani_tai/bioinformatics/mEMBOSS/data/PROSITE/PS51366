* MI domain profile *
*********************

The MI  (after  MA-3 and eIF4G) domain is a protein-protein interaction module
of ~130  amino  acids  [1-3]. It appears in several translation factors and is
found in:

 - One copy in plant and animal eIF4G 1 and 2 (DAP-5/NAT1/p97),
 - Two  copies  in  the animal programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) or MA-3
   that is  induced  during  programmed  cell  death  and  inhibits neoplastic
   transformation,
 - Four tandem-repeated copies in a group of uncharacterized plant proteins.

The MI domain consists of seven alpha-helices, which pack into a globular form
(see <PDB:2IOL>).  The  packing  arrangement  consists  of  repeating pairs of
antiparallel helices  packed  one upon the other such that a superhelical axis
is generated perpendicular to the alpha-helical axes [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire MI domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The MI domain has also been named MA3 domain.
