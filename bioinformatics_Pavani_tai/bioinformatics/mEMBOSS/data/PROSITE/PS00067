* 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase signature *
*********************************************

3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) (HCDH) [1] is an enzyme involved
in fatty acid metabolism,  it catalyzes the reduction  of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to
3-oxoacyl-CoA. Most eukaryotic cells have 2 fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems,
one located in  mitochondria and  the  other in peroxisomes.   In  peroxisomes
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA  dehydrogenase  forms,  with  enoyl-CoA  hydratase (ECH) and
3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI)  a  multifunctional  enzyme  where  the N-
terminal domain bears the hydratase/isomerase  activities  and  the C-terminal
domain the  dehydrogenase  activity.  There are two mitochondrial enzymes: one
which is   monofunctional   and  the  other  which is,  like  its  peroxisomal
counterpart, multifunctional.

In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA) HCDH is part
of a multifunctional enzyme which also contains an ECH/ECI domain as well as a
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [2].

The other proteins structurally related to HCDH are:

 - Bacterial  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.157) which reduces
   3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA [3].
 - Eye  lens  protein  lambda-crystallin [4], which is specific to lagomorphes
   (such as rabbit).

There are two major region of similarities in the sequences of proteins of the
HCDH family, the  first one located in the N-terminal, corresponds to the NAD-
binding site, the second one is located in the center of the sequence. We have
chosen to derive a signature pattern from this central region.
