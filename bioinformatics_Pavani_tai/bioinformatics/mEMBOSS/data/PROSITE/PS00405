* 43 Kd postsynaptic protein signature *
****************************************

The 43 Kd postsynaptic protein [1,2] is  a peripheral membrane protein thought
to  play some  role in  anchoring or  stabilizing  the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor at synaptic sites.  It may  link the receptor to the underlying post-
synaptic cytoskeleton, possibly by direct association with actin or spectrin.

The 43 Kd protein  is  highly conserved  across species.  Two highly conserved
regions, one  encompassing  the N-terminus  and the other near the C-terminus,
may be important for interaction of the protein  with  other components of the
postsynaptic membrane.

As a signature pattern we selected the N-terminus of the mature protein (after
removal of the initiator methionine).  The N-terminal glycine is thought to be
myristoylated.

-Consensus pattern: G-Q-D-Q-T-K-Q-Q-I
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
