* Glycosyl hydrolases family 31 signatures *
********************************************

It has been shown [1,2,3,E1] that the following glycosyl hydrolases can be, on
the basis of sequence similarities, classified into a single family:

 - Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase  (EC 3.2.1.20) (acid maltase)  is  a vertebrate
   glycosidase active at low pH, which  hydrolyzes alpha(1->4) and alpha(1->6)
   linkages in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose.
 - Alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) from the yeast Candida tsukunbaensis.
 - Alpha-glucosidase   (EC   3.2.1.20)  (gene  malA)  from  the  archebacteria
   Sulfolobus solfataricus.
 - Intestinal sucrase-isomaltase  (EC 3.2.1.48 / EC 3.2.1.10) is  a vertebrate
   membrane-bound, multifunctional  enzyme  complex  which hydrolyzes sucrose,
   maltose and isomaltose.  The  sucrase  and isomaltase domains of the enzyme
   are homologous (41% of amino acid identity)  and have most probably evolved
   by duplication.
 - Glucoamylase  1  (EC 3.2.1.3)  (glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase) from  various
   fungal species.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR229c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC30D11.01c.

An aspartic acid has been implicated [4] in the catalytic activity of sucrase,
isomaltase,  and lysosomal alpha-glucosidase.  The  region around  this active
residue is  highly  conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.  We have
used a second region, which contains two conserved cysteines, as an additional
signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [GFY]-[LIVMF]-W-x-D-M-[NSA]-E
                    [D is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for SpAC30D11.01c.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: G-[AVP]-[DT]-[LIVMTAS]-[CG]-G-[FY]-x(3)-[STP]-x(3)-L-[CL]-
                    x-R-W-x(2)-[LVMI]-[GSA]-[SA]-[FY]-x-P-[FY]-x-R-[DNA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for YBR229c which lacks the two cysteines, rat sucrase-isomaltase and malA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
