*******************************************

Phytochrome [1,2,3] is a plant protein that acts as a regulatory photoreceptor
and which mediates red-light effects on a  wide  variety  of physiological and
molecular responses.    Phytochrome  can  undergo a  reversible  photochemical
conversion between a  biologically  inactive red light-absorbing  form and the
active far-red light-absorbing form.   Phytochrome is a dimer of identical 124
Kd subunits, each  of which contains a covalently attached linear tetrapyrrole
chromophore.

The chromophore  is  attached  to  a  cysteine  which  is  located in a highly
conserved region that can be used as a signature pattern.

Synechocystis strain  PCC  6803 hypothetical protein slr0473 contains a domain
similar to that of plants phytochrome and seems to also bind a chromophore.
