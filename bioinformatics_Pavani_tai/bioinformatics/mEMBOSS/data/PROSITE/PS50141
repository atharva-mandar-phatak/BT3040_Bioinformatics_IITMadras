* Adenosine to inosine editase domain profile *
***********************************************

Editase (EC 3.5.4.-)  are enzymes that catalyze the site-selective deamination
of adenosine  residue  into inosine within double stranded regions of mRNA. In
mRNA inosine  is  read as guanosine by the translation apparatus, resulting in
codon changes  within the synthesized protein. The editase domain contains the
active site and binds three zinc atoms [1].

Several editases  share  a  common  global  arrangement of domains. Hence, the
DRADA proteins  contain  two  DRADA  repeats  (see  <PDOC50139>), three double
stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBD) (see <PDOC50137>), and one editase domain
from N-  to  C-terminus,  while  the  RED1 and RED2 editases have a simplified
domains structure with no DRADA repeat and only two dsRBD [2].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Editases that  deaminate cytidine are not detected by this profile (see
 <PDOC00702>).
