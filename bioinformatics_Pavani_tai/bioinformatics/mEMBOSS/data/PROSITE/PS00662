* Bacterial type II secretion system protein E signature *
**********************************************************

A number  of  bacterial  proteins,  some  of  which  are involved in a general
secretion pathway  (GSP) for the export  of  proteins (also called the type II
pathway) [1,2],  have  been  found to be evolutionary related.  These proteins
are listed below:

 - The    'E'   protein from the GSP operon of: Aeromonas (gene exeE); Erwinia
   (gene outE);  Escherichia  coli  (gene  yheG);  Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene
   pulE); Pseudomonas  aeruginosa (gene xcpR); Vibrio cholerae (gene epsE) and
   Xanthomonas campestris (gene xpsE).
 - Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid virB operon protein 11.  This  protein
   is required for the transfer of T-DNA to plants.
 - Bacillus subtilis comG operon protein 1 which is required for the uptake of
   DNA by competent Bacillus subtilis cells.
 - Aeromonas hydrophila tapB, involved in type IV pilus assembly.
 - Pseudomonas protein pilB, which is essential for the formation of the pili.
 - Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein twitching mobility protein pilT.
 - Neisseria gonorrhoeae type IV pilus assembly protein pilF.
 - Vibrio cholerae protein tcpT, which  is involved in the biosynthesis of the
   tcp pilus.
 - Escherichia coli protein hofB (hopB).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygcB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yggR.

These proteins have from 344 (pilT and virB11) to 568 (tapB) amino acids, they
are probably  cytoplasmically located and, on  the  basis of the presence of a
conserved P-loop region (see <PDOC00017>), probably bind ATP.  As  a signature
pattern we  selected  a  region  that  overlaps  the  'B' motif of ATP-binding
proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-R-x(2)-P-D-x-[LIVM](3)-G-E-[LIVM]-R-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ygcB.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
