* Methylthiotransferase domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

The  methylthiotransferase  (MTTase)  or  miaB-like  family is named after the
(dimethylallyl)adenosine  tRNA  MTTase  miaB protein, which catalyzes a C-H to
C-S  bond  conversion  in  the  methylthiolation  of tRNA. A related bacterial
enzyme  rimO  performs a similar methylthiolation, but on a protein substrate.
RimO  acts on the ribosomal protein S12 and forms a separate MTTase subfamily.
The  miaB-subfamily  includes  mammalian  CDK5  regulatory  subunit-associated
proteins and similar proteins in other eukaryotes. Two other subfamilies, yqeV
and  CDKAL1,  are  named  after  a  Bacillus  subtilis  and  a  human protein,
respectively. While yqeV-like proteins are found in bacteria, CDKAL1 subfamily
members occur in eukaryotes and in archaebacteria.
The  likely  MTTases  from  these  4  subfamilies  contain a N-terminal MTTase
domain,  a  central  radical generating fold and a C-terminal TRAM domain (see
<PDOC50926>).  The  core  forms  a  radical  SAM  fold  (or  AdoMet  radical),
containing  a  cysteine  motif CxxxCxxC that binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster [1-4]. A
reducing   equivalent   from   the   [4Fe-4S]+   cluster  is  used  to  cleave
S-adenosylmethionine  (SAM)  to  generate  methionine  and  a 5'-deoxyadenosyl
radical. The latter is thought to produce a reactive substrate radical that is
amenable  to  sulfur  insertion [3,4]. The N-terminal MTTase domain contains 3
cysteines   that   bind   a  second  [4Fe-4S]  cluster,  in  addition  to  the
radical-generating [4Fe-4S] cluster, which could be involved in the thiolation
reaction.  The  C-terminal  TRAM  domain  is not shared with other radical SAM
proteins  outside the MTTase family. The TRAM domain can bind to RNA substrate
and seems to be important for substrate recognition.
The  tertiary  structure  of  the  central radical SAM fold has six beta/alpha
motifs  resembling  a three-quarter TIM barrel core (see <PDOC00155>) [5]. The
N-terminal  MTTase  domain  might  form an additional [beta/alpha]2 TIM barrel
unit [3].

Some proteins known to contain a MTTase domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial  (Dimethylallyl)adenosine tRNA methylthiotransferase miaB (yleA),
   which  catalyzes the methylthiolation of N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine (i6A),
   leading   to   the  formation  of  2-methylthio-N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine
   (ms2i6A) at position 37 in tRNAs that read codons beginning with uridine.
 - Human  CDK5  regulatory  subunit-associated  protein  1  (CDK5RAP1),  which
   specifically inhibits CDK5 activation by CDK5R1.
 - Plant  CDK5RAP1-like  protein,  a  miaB-like  potential  regulator  of CDK5
   activity.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  and  amoebal  CDK5RAP1-like  proteins,  miaB-like
   potential regulators of CDK5 activity.
 - Escherichia  coli  ribosomal protein S12 methylthiotransferase rimO (yliG),
   which  catalyzes  the  methylthiolation  of the residue Asp-88 of ribosomal
   protein S12.
 - Synechocystis  strain  PCC 6803 ribosomal protein S12 methylthiotransferase
   rimO (slr0082).
 - Bacillus subtilis putative methylthiotransferase yqeV (EC 2.-.-.-).
 - Mycoplasma iowae putative methylthiotransferase in 16S RNA 5'region.
 - Helicobacter pylori putative methylthiotransferase HP_0285 (EC 2.-.-.-).
 - Rickettsia prowazekii putative methylthiotransferase RP416 (EC 2.-.-.-).
 - Vertebrate CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1).
 - Fruit fly CDKAL1-like protein (CG6550).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans CDKAL1-like protein (Y92H12BL.1).
 - Methanocaldococcus  jannaschii  CDKAL1-like putative methylthiotransferases
   MTH_826 and MJ0867 (EC 2.-.-.-).
 - Methanocaldococcus jannaschii putative methylthiotransferase MJ0865.

These  proteins  range  in  size  from  about  47  to  61 Kd. They contain six
conserved  cysteines, three of which form the motif in the central radical SAM
fold  that can be used as a signature pattern [1]. We also developed a profile
that covers the N-terminal MTTase domain, including the other [4Fe-4S] cluster
binding cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[LIVMT]-x(2)-G-C-x(3)-C-[STAN]-[FY]-C-x-[LIVMT]-
                    x(4)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note:  Historically,  the  conserved cysteines of the radical SAM fold in the
 central  part of these proteins have been used as a signature for this family
 with the name uncharacterized protein family UPF0004.
