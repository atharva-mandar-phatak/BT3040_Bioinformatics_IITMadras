* ApaG domain profile *
***********************

The  apaG  domain  is  a  ~125  amino  acids  domain present in bacterial apaG
proteins  and  in  eukaryotic  F-box  proteins.  The domain is named after the
bacterial  apaG protein, of which it forms the core. The domain also occurs in
the  C-terminal  part  of  eukaryotic proteins with an N-terminal F-box domain
(see  <PDOC50181>).  The  Salmonella  typhimurium  apaG domain protein corD is
involved  in  Co(2+)  resistance  and  Mg(2+) efflux. Tertiary structures from
different  apaG  proteins show a fold of several beta-sheets (see <PDB:1XVS>).
The apaG domain may be involved in protein-protein interactions which could be
implicated in substrate-specificity [1-4].

Some proteins known to contain an apaG domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  apaG,  a  protein  that  is well-conserved among diverse
   bacteria.
 - Salmonella typhimurium apaG/corD, involved in Co(2+) sensitivity and Mg(2+)
   homeostasis [1].
 - Mammalian  FBA/F-box  only  protein 3, a substrate-recognition component of
   the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [2].
 - Mammalian    PDIP38/POLD2-interacting   protein,   which   interacts   with
   proliferating  cell  nuclear  antigen  (PCNA)  and  the  p50 subunit of DNA
   polymerase delta. It is conserved among metazoans [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire apaG domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
