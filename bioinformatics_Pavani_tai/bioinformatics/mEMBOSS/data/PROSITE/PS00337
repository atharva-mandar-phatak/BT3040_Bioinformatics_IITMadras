******************************************************

Beta-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) [1,2]  are enzymes  which catalyze the hydrolysis
of an amide bond in  the  beta-lactam ring  of  antibiotics  belonging  to the
penicillin/cephalosporin  family.   Four  kinds of  beta-lactamase  have  been
identified [3]. Class-B enzymes are zinc containing  proteins whilst class -A,
C and D enzymes  are  serine hydrolases.  The  three  classes of serine  beta-
lactamases are  evolutionary related and belong to a superfamily [4] that also
includes DD-peptidases  and  a  variety  of  other penicillin-binding proteins
(PBP's). All these proteins contain a  Ser-x-x-Lys motif,  where the serine is
the active site residue.  Although  clearly  homologous,  the sequences of the
three classes of serine beta-lactamases exhibit a large degree  of variability
and only a small number of residues are conserved in addition to the catalytic
serine.

Since a  pattern  detecting all serine beta-lactamases would also pick up many
unrelated sequences,  we decided to provide specific patterns, centered on the
active site serine, for each of the three classes.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-x-[LIVMFY]-{E}-S-[TV]-x-K-x(3)-{T}-[AGLM]-{D}-{KA}-
                    [LC]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL  class-A
 beta-lactamases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 7.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-E-[LIVM]-G-S-[LIVMG]-[SA]-K
                    [The first S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL  class-C
 beta-lactamases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [PA]-x-S-[ST]-F-K-[LIV]-[PALV]-x-[STA]-[LI]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL  class-D
 beta-lactamases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
