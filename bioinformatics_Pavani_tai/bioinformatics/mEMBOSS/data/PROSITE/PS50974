* AdoMet activation domain profile *
************************************

Prokaryotic and    eukaryotic   B12-dependent   methionine   synthase   (MetH)
(EC 2.1.1.13)  is  a  large,  modular protein that catalyses the transfer of a
methyl group  from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to homocysteine (Hcy)
to form  methionine,  using  cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier. MetH
enzymes consist  of  four functional modules arranged in a linear fashion with
single interdomain  connectors.  The  N-terminal  Hcy domain (see <PDOC50970>)
utilizes a  Zn(Cys)3  cluster to bind and activate Hcy, the second module, the
pterin-binding domain   (see  <PDOC50972>),  activates  methyltetrahydrofolate
(CH3-H4folate) for  methyl transfer, and the third module binds cobalamin. The
fourth C-terminal  module  binds  S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet, or SAM) and is
required for  reductive  activation. The ~330-residue AdoMet activation domain
of MetH  is  a  C-shaped  single  domain  whose  central  feature  is  a  bent
antiparallel beta-sheet (see <PDB:1MSK>. The AdoMet ligand binds to the domain
near the center of the inner face of the 'C' and is held in place by both side
chain and backbone interactions. The three-dimensional structure of the AdoMet
activation domain  of  MetH  is  unlike any of the recently determined AdoMet-
dependent DNA-  and RNA-methyltransferases or the catechol O-methyltransferase
[1].

The profile we developed covers the entire AdoMet activation domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
