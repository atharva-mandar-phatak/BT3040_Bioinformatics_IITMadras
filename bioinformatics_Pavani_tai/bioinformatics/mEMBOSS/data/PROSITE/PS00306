* Caseins alpha/beta signature *
********************************

Caseins [1]  are the  major  protein  constituent  of  milk.  Caseins  can  be
classified into two families; the first consists of the kappa-caseins, and the
second groups the alpha-s1, alpha-s2, and beta-caseins. The alpha/beta caseins
are a rapidly diverging family of proteins. However two regions are conserved:
a cluster of  phosphorylated  serine residues  and  the signal  sequence.  The
signature pattern we selected for this family of proteins is based on the last
eight residues of the signal sequence.

-Consensus pattern: C-L-[LV]-A-x-A-[LVF]-A
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.

-Note: Alpha-s2 casein is  known as epsilon-casein in mouse,   gamma-casein in
 rat and  casein-A in guinea pig.  Alpha-s1 casein is known as alpha-casein in
 rat and rabbit and as casein-B in guinea-pig.
