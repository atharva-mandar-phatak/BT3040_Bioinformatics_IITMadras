* Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) profile *
******************************************

The Krueppel-associated  box  (KRAB) is a domain of around 75 amino acids that
is found in the N-terminal part of about one third of eukaryotic Krueppel-type
C2H2 zinc  finger proteins (ZFPs) (see <PDOC00028>). It is enriched in charged
amino acids and can be divided into subregions A and B, which are predicted to
fold into  two  amphipathic  alpha-helices.  The  KRAB  A  and  B boxes can be
separated by  variable spacer segments and many KRAB proteins contain only the
A box [1].

The KRAB  domain functions as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to the
template DNA by a DNA-binding domain. A sequence of 45 amino acids in the KRAB
A subdomain  has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional
repression. The  B  box  does  not  repress  by itself but does potentiate the
repression exerted  by the KRAB A subdomain [2,3]. Gene silencing requires the
binding of  the KRAB domain to the RING-B box-coiled coil (RBCC) domain of the
KAP-1/TIF1-beta corepressor.  As  KAP-1  binds to the heterochromatin proteins
HP1, it  has  been  proposed  that  the  KRAB-ZFP-bound  target  gene could be
silenced following recruitment to heterochromatin [4,5].

KRAB-ZFPs probably  constitute  the  single  largest  class  of  transcription
factors within  the  human  genome  [6]. Although the function of KRAB-ZFPs is
largely unknown,   they   appear   to   play   important   roles  during  cell
differentiation and development.

The profile we developed spans the complete KRAB domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
