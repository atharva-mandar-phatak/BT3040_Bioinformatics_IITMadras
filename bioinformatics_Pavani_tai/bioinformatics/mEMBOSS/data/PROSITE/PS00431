* Small hydrophilic plant seed proteins signature *
***************************************************

The following small hydrophilic plant seed proteins are structurally related:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana proteins GEA1 and GEA6.
 - Cotton late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein D-19.
 - Carrot EMB-1 protein.
 - Barley LEA proteins B19.1A, B19.1B, B19.3 and B19.4.
 - Maize late embryogenesis abundant protein Emb564.
 - Radish late seed maturation protein p8B6.
 - Rice embryonic abundant protein Emp1.
 - Sunflower 10 Kd late embryogenesis abundant protein (DS10).
 - Wheat Em proteins.

These proteins contains from 83 to 153 amino acid residues and may play a role
[1,2] in  equipping  the  seed  for  survival,  maintaining a minimal level of
hydration in  the  dry organism and preventing the denaturation of cytoplasmic
components. They  may  also play a role during imbibition by controlling water
uptake.

As a signature pattern, we  selected the best conserved region in the sequence
of these proteins,  it is a glycine-rich nonapeptide located in the N-terminal
section.

-Consensus pattern: G-[EQ]-T-V-V-P-G-G-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
