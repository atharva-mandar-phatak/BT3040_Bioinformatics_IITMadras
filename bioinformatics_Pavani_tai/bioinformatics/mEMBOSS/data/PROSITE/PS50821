* PAZ domain profile *
**********************

The PAZ domain is a domain of about 110 amino-acids which has been named after
three  of  the proteins containing it: Piwi, Argonaute and Zwille/Pinhead [1].
It is found in the Argonaute and the Dicer protein families, whose members are
implicated in  stem-cell  fate  determination  and  post-transcriptional  gene
silencing (PTGS)  through  RNA  interference  (RNAi)  [2,3].  PTGS RNAi is the
mechanism through  which  double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) silence cognate genes.
It is characterized by the presence of RNAs of about 22 nucleotides  in length
that are  homologous to the gene to be suppressed. These nucleotide  sequences
serve as  guide  sequences  that  instruct the RNA-induced  silencing  complex
(RISC) nuclease to destroy specific mRNAs [4]. Proteins belonging to the Dicer
family are  enzymes that are involved in the generation of putative guide RNAs
by specifically cleaving dsRNAs [3]. The function of proteins of the Argonaute
family is   not  known,  but  they  could  be  implicated  in  transcriptional
initiation [2].

Although the sequence of the PAZ domain does not reveal its possible role, its
presence in  both the Argonaute and Dicer protein families indicates  that  it
might  be important  for  the  function  of  these  proteins  in RNAi and cell
differentiation [1].

Some proteins known to contain a PAZ domain are listed below:

Proteins of the Argonaute family:

 - Eukaryotic  translation initiation factor 2C (eIF2C). It plays an important
   role in the eukaryotic peptide chain initiation process.
 - Drosophila  Piwi  proteins.  It  is essential for germ-line stem cell self-
   renewal.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans RNA Interference Deficient 1 (rde-1). It is required
   for RNAi and transposon silencing.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  Argonaute  (Ago)  protein. It is involved in RNAi as
   well as  in  leaves  and  floral  organs development and axillary meristems
   formation.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  Zwille (Zll) or Pinhead (Pnh). It is a developmental
   protein required  for  reliable  formation  of  primary  and axillary shoot
   apical meristems.

These proteins also contain a Piwi domain (see <PDOC50822>) in addition to the
PAZ domain [1].

Proteins of the Dicer family:

 - Drosophila Dicer (Dcr) protein.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana Carpel Factory (CAF) protein. It is homologous to Dcr
   and plays a role in floral meristem determinacy [5].

In  addition  to the PAZ domain, these proteins contain DEAD/DEAH box helicase
(see <PDOC00039>), RNase III (see <PDOC00448>) and double stranded RNA-binding
domains (dsRBD) (see <PDOC50137>).

The profile we have developed covers the entire PAZ domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
