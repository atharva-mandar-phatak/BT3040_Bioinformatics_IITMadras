* KilA-N domain profile *
*************************

The amino-terminal  module  of  the  poxvirus D6R/NIR proteins defines a novel
conserved DNA-binding domain (the KilA-N domain) that is found in a wide range
of proteins  of  large  bacterial  and  eukaryotic  DNA  viruses [1]. Putative
proteins with  homology  to  the  KilA-N  domain  have also been identified in
Maverick transposable   elements   of  the  parabasalid  protozoa  Trichomonas
vaginalis [2].  The  KilA-N  domain has been suggested to be homologous to the
fungal DNA-binding  APSES  domain  (see <PDOC51299>). In all proteins shown to
contain the KilA-N domain, it occurs at the extreme amino terminus accompanied
by a  wide  range of distinct carboxy-terminal domains. These carboxy-terminal
modules may  be  enzymes,  such  as  the  nuclease  domains,  or might mediate
additional, specific  interactions  with  nucleic  acids or proteins, like the
RING (see <PDOC00449>) or CCCH fingers in the poxviruses [1].

The KilA-N domain is predicted to adopt an alpha+beta fold with four conserved
strands and at least two conserved helices [1].

Some proteins known to contain a KilA-N domain are listed below:

 - Bacteriophage P1 protein kilA.
 - Fowlpox virus (FPV) protein FPV236.
 - Fowlpox virus (FPV) hypothetical protein FPV248.
 - Vaccinia virus hypothetical 21.7 kDa HindIII-C protein.

The profile we developed covers the entire KilA-N domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
