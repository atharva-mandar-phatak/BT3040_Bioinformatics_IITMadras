* Zinc finger MYND-type signature and profile *
***********************************************

The  MYND-type  zinc  finger  was  called  after  the three best characterized
members  of  the  family  (MYeloid  translocation  protein 8 (MTG8/ETO), Nervy
protein and Deaf-1) [1]. In MTG8 and Bop proteins this domain is important for
the recruitment of a repressive complexe containing histone deacetylase (HDAC)
activity [2,3]. In M2-type chronic leukemia where AML1 is fused to MTG8, AML1,
normaly  a  transcriptional  activator,  is  converted  into a transcriptional
repressor.  The MYND domain of MTG8 is essential for this conversion and seems
to  function  by  recruiting  the  nuclear co-repressor N-CoR/mSin3A and HDACs
complexes to DNA sites specified by AML1 [2].

The  MYND-type  zinc  finger contains 8 amino acids that can coordinate 2 zinc
atoms.

Some proteins containing a MYND-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Mammalian MTG8/ETO protein. MTG8 is part of a high molecular weight complex
   that contains co-repressors and HDACs.
 - Drosophila Nervy protein, a homologue of MTG8.
 - Animal  Deformed  epidermal  autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf-1). It was first
   identified  in  drosophila  as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that
   was isolated as a putative cofactor of the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd).
 - Vertebrate  Bop  protein.  In mouse it is expressed specifically in cardiac
   and  muscle  precursors  before  differentiation of these lineages.
 - Mammalian  programmed  cell  death protein 2 (PDCD2/RP8). It interacts with
   N-CoR/mSin3A  complexes  and with Host cell factor 1 (HCF1), a component of
   the C1 complex [4].
 - Adenovirus  5  E1A-binding  protein (BS69). It binds to the transactivation
   domain  of the adenovirus type 5 E1A 32 kda protein (289R) and inhibits its
   transactivating activity.

The profile and the pattern we developed cover the whole domain.
