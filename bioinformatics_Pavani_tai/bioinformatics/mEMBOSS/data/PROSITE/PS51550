* Eph receptor ligand binding (Eph LBD) domain profile *
********************************************************

The Eph  receptors, which bind a group of cell-membrane-anchored ligands known
as ephrins,  represent  the  largest  subfamily  of  receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) (see <PDOC00629>). The Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands control a
diverse array  of  cell-cell interactions in the nervous and vascular systems.
On ephrin  binding,  the  Eph kinase domain is activated, initiating 'forward'
signaling in  the  receptor-expressing cells. Simultaneously, signals are also
induced in  the  ligand-expressing cells a phenomenon referred to as 'reverse'
signalling. The  extracellular  Eph  receptor region contains a conserved 180-
amino-acid N-terminal  ligand-binding domain (LBD) which is both necessary and
sufficient for  bindings of the receptors to their ephrin ligands. An adjacent
cysteine-rich region  might  be  involved in receptor–receptor oligomerization
often observed  on  ligand  binding, whereas the next two fibronectin type III
repeats (see <PDOC50853>) have yet to be assigned a clear biological function.
The cytoplasmic   Eph   receptor   region   contains   a  kinase  domain  (see
<PDOC00100>), a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain (see <PDOC50105>), and a PDZ-
binding motif.  The  ligand-binding domain (LBD) of Eph receptors is unique to
this family  of  RTKs  ans  shares no significant amino-acid-sequence homology
with other known proteins [1,2,3].

The Eph  LBD  domain  forms  a  compact  globular structure which folds into a
jellyroll beta-sandwich   composed   of   11  antiparallel  beta-strands  (see
<PDB:1NUK>). It  has  two antiparallel beta-sheets, with the usual left-handed
twist, packed  against each other to form a compact beta-sandwich, and a short
3(10) helix [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire Eph LBD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
