* Zinc finger SP-RING-type profile *
************************************

SIZ1,  SIZ2,  and  PIAS  (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins form a
conserved  family defined by an unusual RING-related domain, the Siz/PIAS RING
finger (SP-RING)  [1].  While  RING  fingers  coordinate two Zn2+ ions, with a
cross-brace architecture,  the  SP-RING  finger  contains only one Zn2+ ion in
site B,  which is coordinated in a tetrahedral configuration (see <PDB:3I2D>).
Three of  the four amino acid side chains that coordinate the Zn2+ ion at site
A in  RING  proteins are lacking in Siz/PIAS proteins [2]. Like classical RING
fingers SP-RINGs  function  as  an E3 enzyme but specific for sumoylation (see
<PDOC00449> for  more details on the ubiquitination pathway). The SP-RING zinc
finger has  the  capacity  to interact with Ubc9 (the SUMO specific E2 enzyme)
and the  substrate  and  thus  can  increase the rate of substrate sumoylation
[3,4].

Some proteins known to contain an SP-RING zinc finger are listed below:

 - Mammalian PIAS proteins (PIAS 1,3,x and y). They bind to STAT transcription
   factors  and  prevent STAT-activated transcription. The mouse PIAS3 protein
   has also been called Msx-interacting-zinc finger protein (Miz1) [5].
 - Drosophila  Su(var)2-10. It is required for proper chromosome structure and
   chromosome inheritance [6].
 - Yeast  SIZ1  and  SIZ2.  They  are  required  for  SUMO  attachment  to the
   cytoskeletal septin proteins.
 - Pli1, the unique fission yeast member of the SP-RING family. It is involved
   in centromeric function.

The profile we developed covers the whole SP-RING-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The SP-RING-type zinc  finger is also known as the MIZ-type zinc finger
 [5].
