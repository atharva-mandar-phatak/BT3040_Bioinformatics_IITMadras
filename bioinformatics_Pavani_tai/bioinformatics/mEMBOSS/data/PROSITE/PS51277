* BURP domain profile *
***********************

The BURP  domain  is  a ~230-residue module, which has been named for the four
members of the group initially identified, BNM2, USP, RD22, and PG1beta. It is
found in  the  C-terminal  part of a number of plant cell wall proteins, which
are defined not only by the BURP domain, but also by the overall similarity in
their modular  construction. The BURP domain proteins consists of either three
or four  modules: (i) an N-terminal hydrophobic domain - a presumptive transit
peptide, joined  to  (ii)  a  short  conserved segment or other short segment,
(iii) an optional segment consisting of repeated units which is unique to each
member, and (iv) the C-terminal BURP domain. Although the BURP domain proteins
share primary   structural   features,   their  expression  patterns  and  the
conditions under  which  they  are  expressed  differ.  The  presence  of  the
conserved BURP  domain  in  diverse  plant  proteins suggests an important and
fundamental functional  role for this domain [1]. It is possible that the BURP
domain represents a general motif for localization of proteins within the cell
wall matrix.  The  other  structural  domains  associated with the BURP domain
may specify other target sites for intermolecular interactions [2].

Some proteins known to contain a BURP domain are listed below [1-3]:

 - Brassica  napus BNM2, which is expressed during the induction of microspore
   embryogenesis.
 - Field bean USPs, abundant non-storage seed proteins with unknown function.
 - Soybean  USP-like  proteins  ADR6  (or  SALI5-4A),  an  auxin -repressible,
   aluminium-inducible protein  and SALI3-2, a protein that is up-regulated by
   aluminium.
 - Soybean seed coat BURP-domain protein 1 (SCB1). It might play a role in the
   differenciation of the seed coat parenchyma cells.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana RD22 drought induced protein.
 - Maize ZRP2, a protein of unknown function in cortex parenchyma.
 - Tomato  PG1beta,  the  beta-subunit  of  polygalacturonase isozyme 1 (PG1),
   which is expressed in ripening fruits.
 - Cereal  RAFTIN.  It  is  essential specifically for the maturation phase of
   pollen development.

The profile we developed covers the entire BURP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
