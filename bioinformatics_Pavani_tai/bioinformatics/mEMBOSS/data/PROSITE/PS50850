***********************************************
* Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) profile *
***********************************************

Transporters can  be  grouped  in two classes, primary and secondary carriers.
The primary  active  transporters  drive  solute  accumulation or extrusion by
using ATP    hydrolysis,   photon   absorption,   electron   flow,   substrate
decarboxylation or methyl transfer. If charged molecules are  unidirectionally
pumped as  a  consequence  of  the  consumption  of  a primary cellular energy
source, electron  chemical  potential results. This potential can than be used
to drive the active transport of additional solutes via secondary carriers.

Among   the   different  transporter  the  two  largest  families  that  occur
ubiquitously  in all classifications of organisms are the ATP-Binding Cassette
(ABC)   primary  transporter  superfamily  (see  <PDOC00185>)  and  the  Major
Facilitator  Superfamily  (MFS).  The  MFS transporters are single-polypeptide
secondary  carriers  capable only of transporting small solutes in response to
chemiosmotic  ion  gradients [1,2]. They function as uniporters, symporters or
antiporters.  In  addition  their  solute  specificity  are  also diverse. MFS
proteins contain 12 transmembrane regions (with some variations).

The  3D-structure  of  human  GLUT1,  an  archetype  of the  major facilitator
superfamily  has  been  solved (see <PDB:1JA5>) [3]. Helices 1-5, 8, 10-12 are
arranged  in  a  9-member barrel-like manner, delimiting a hydrophilic central
channel.  Helix 7 is located in the center of the channel suggesting a role in
regulating transport of solutes through the channel.

Some proteins known to belong to the MFS superfamily are listed below:

 - Sugar  transporters. The  largest  family,  they  can  function by uniport,
   solute-solute  antiport or solute-cation symport depending on the system or
   conditions (see <PDOC00190>).
 - Drug:H+  antiporters  or multidrug transporters. The extrusion of cytotoxic
   drugs from multidrug resistant cells by overexpressed multidrug transporter
   is  an  important  cause  of failure of the drug-based treatment of patient
   with  cancers  or infections  by pathogenic  microorganisms [4].
 - Organophosphate:Pi   antiporters   (OPA).  Small  permeases  restricted  to
   bacteria.
 - Oligosaccharide:H+ symporters (OHS). Permeases restricted to bacteria.
 - Metabolite:H+ symporters (MHS).
 - Nitrate/nitrite  symporter (NNP). This family is present in bacteria, fungi
   and plants. It catalyzes either nitrate uptake or nitrite efflux.
 - Phosphate:H+ symporters (PHS). It is present only in fungi and plants.
 - Nucleoside:H+ symporters (NHS). Small permeases restricted to Gram-negative
   bacteria.
 - Oxalate/formate   antiporters  (OFA).  Present  in  bacteria,  archaea  and
   eukaryotes.
 - Sialate:H+    symporters (SHS). Small permeases restricted to Gram-negative
   bacteria.
 - Monocarboxylate porters (MCP).
 - Anion:cation symporters (ACS).
 - Aromatic   acid:H+  symporters (AAHS). They transport a variety of aromatic
   acids  as well as cis,cis-muconate. One member of this family (PCAK) serves
   as a chemoreceptor allowing the bacteria to swim up concentration gradiants
   of its substrate [5].
 - Cyanate permeases (CP). Small bacterial proteins of around 400 residues.
 - Proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (POT). AAHS and POT are the most
   divergent MFS families.

The profile we developed covers the 12 transmembrane regions.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
