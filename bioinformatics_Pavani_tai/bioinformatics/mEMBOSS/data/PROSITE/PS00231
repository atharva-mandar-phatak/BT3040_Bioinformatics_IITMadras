* F-actin capping protein beta subunit signature *
**************************************************

The F-actin capping protein binds in  a calcium-independent manner to the fast
growing ends of  actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of
subunits at these ends.   Unlike  gelsolin  and  severin this protein does not
sever actin filaments.  The  F-actin capping protein is a heterodimer composed
of two unrelated subunits: alpha and beta.

The beta subunit is a protein  of about 280 amino acid residues whose sequence
is well conserved in eukaryotic species [1].   As a signature pattern we chose
a conserved hexapeptide in the N-terminal section of the beta subunit.

-Consensus pattern: C-[DE]-[YF]-N-R-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
