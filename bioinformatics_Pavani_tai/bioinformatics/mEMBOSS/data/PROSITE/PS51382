* SPX domain profile *
**********************

Hydrophilic and poorly conserved SPX (SYG1, Pho81 and XPR11) domains, of about
180 residues,  are  found  at  the N-termini of various proteins, particularly
signal transduction  proteins.  There are proteins harboring the SPX domain in
all major  eukaryotic  kingdoms. SPX domains are composed of three subdomains,
which are  separated  by  two  areas  of  low  similarity.  They are often (1)
variable in  sequence,  (2)  split due to insertions, or (3) fragmented due to
deletions. The  tripartite SPX domain could function as a sensor for inorganic
phosphate (Pi)  level  and  is  most  likely a domain for protein interaction.
Possibly all  SPX  domains  bind  G-protein  beta-subunits  for the purpose of
signal transduction [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain a SPX domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  SYG1, a protein involved in the mating pheromone signal transduction
   pathway.
 - Yeast  PHO81,  the  putative  sensor of Pi levels. It is a cyclin-dependent
   kinase (CDK)  inhibitor  that is induced by Pi starvation, interacting with
   cyclin PHO80    to  repress  the  activity of CDK PHO85, thus promoting the
   expression of PHO2/PHO4 and enhancing yeast tolerance to Pi starvation.
 - Vertebrate xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 receptor (XPR1),
   initially identified as a retrovirus receptor but for which the function in
   uninfected cells remains unknown.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  PHO1, a protein involved in the loading of inorganic
   phosphate into  the  xylem  of  roots.  It  harbors  both aSPX and EXS (see
   <PDOC51380>) domains.
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana   PHO1-like   proteins  (identified  as  PHO1;H1  to
   PHO1;H10).
 - Arabidopsis    thaliana  SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE 1 (SHB1), homologous to
   yeast SYG1.  It  acts  in  cryptochrome signaling and possible phytochrome-
   mediated light responses.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  AtSPX1-AtSPX4,  which  are  part  of  the phosphate-
   signaling network that involves SIZ1/PHR1.
 - Barley IDS4 (iron-deficiency specific clone 4). It contains part of the SPX
   domain and is preferentially expressed in Fe-deficient roots.
 - Tomato  IDS4-like protein. It interacts with the leucine zipper domain (see
   <PDOC00029>) of a hypoxia-induced transcription factor involved in the low-
   oxygen response.

The profile we developed covers the entire SPX domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
