* TBC/rab GAP domain profile *
******************************

The ~200  amino  acid  TBC/rab  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain is well
conserved across  species  and  has  been  found  in a wide range of different
proteins from  plant  adhesion  molecules to mammalian oncogenes. The name TBC
derives from  the  name  of  the  murine protein Tbc1 in which this domain was
first identified  based  on its similarity to sequences in the tre-2 oncogene,
and the  yeast  regulators  of  mitosis, BUB2 and cdc16 [1]. The connection of
this domain with rab GTPase activation stems from subsequent in-depth sequence
analyses and  alignments  [2] and recent work demonstrating that it appears to
contain the    catalytic activities of the yeast rab GAPs, GYP1, and GYP7 [3].
The TBC/rab GAP domain  has  also been named PTM after three proteins known to
contain it:  the  Drosophila  pollux, the human oncoprotein TRE17 (oncoTRE17),
and a myeloid cell line-expressed protein [4].

The TBC/rab GAP domain  contains  six  conserved  motifs  named  A to F [2]. A
conserved arginine  residue  in  the  sequence  motif  B  has been shown to be
critical for  the full GAP activity [3]. Resolution of the 3D structure of the
TBC/rab GAP domain of GYP1 has shown that it is a fully alpha-helical V-shaped
molecule (see <PDB:1FKM>). The conserved arginine residue is positioned at the
side of  the narrow cleft on the concave site of the V-shaped molecule. It has
been proposed  that  this  cleft  is  the  binding  site  for  the GTPase. The
conserved arginine  residue  probably functions as a catalytic arginine finger
analogous to  that  seen  in  ras  and  Rho-GAPs. The  two key features of the
arginine finger  activation  mechanism appear to be (i) the positioning of the
catalytically essential  GTPase  glutamine  side  chain via a hydrogen bonding
interaction between  the  glutamine  carbamoyl-NH2  group  and  the main chain
carbonyl group  of  the  GAP arginine, and (ii) the polarization of the gamma-
phosphate group  or  the  stabilization of charge on it via the interaction of
the positively charged side chain guanidinoyl group of the GAP arginine [5].

Some proteins known to contain a TBC/rab GAP domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  mitotic  check point protein BUB2. BUB2 monitors spindle microtubule
   assembly during mitosis.
 - Yeast  GTPase-activating  proteins  (GAPs)  GYP  1  to  7. GAPs enhance the
   inherently slow  GTPase  activity  of  Ras-like proteins, which function as
   binary molecular switches controlling cellular pathways.
 - Yeast MIC1 protein.
 - Fission  yeast  cell  division  control protein 16 (CDC16). It is part of a
   checkpoint control system regulating septum formation.
 - Drosophila pollux, an adhesion molecule.
 - Mammalian rab GAPs.
 - Human TRE oncogene protein.
 - Human  EBP50-PDZ  interactor  of  64 kDa (EPI64). It binds to the first PDZ
   domain of EBP50 and E3KARP [6].

The profile  we  developed  covers  the  entire  six  conserved  motifs of the
TBC/rab GAP domain.
