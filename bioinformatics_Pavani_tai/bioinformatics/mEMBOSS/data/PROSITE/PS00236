* Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels signature *
*************************************************

Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels [1,2,3,4] provide the molecular  basis for
rapid  signal  transmission  at  chemical  synapses.  They  are  post-synaptic
oligomeric transmembrane complexes that transiently form a ionic  channel upon
the binding  of  a  specific  neurotransmitter.  Presently,  the  sequence  of
subunits from five types of neurotransmitter-gated receptors are known:

 - The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR),  an excitatory cation channel.
   In  the motor  endplates  of vertebrates, it is  composed of four different
   subunits  (alpha,  beta,  gamma  and   delta  or  epsilon)   with  a  molar
   stoichiometry of 2:1:1:1. In neurones, the AchR receptor is composed of two
   different  types  of  subunits:  alpha  and  non-alpha  (also called beta).
   Nicotinic AchRs are also found in invertebrates.
 - The glycine  receptor, an inhibitory  chloride  ion  channel.  The  glycine
   receptor is a pentamer composed of two different subunits (alpha and beta).
 - The gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)  receptor, which  is  also an inhibitory
   chloride ion channel.  The quaternary  structure  of the  GABA receptor  is
   complex; at least four classes of subunits are known to exist (alpha, beta,
   gamma, and delta)  and  there are many variants in each class (for example:
   six variants of the alpha class have already been sequenced).
 - The serotonin 5HT3 receptor. Serotonin is a biogenic hormone that functions
   as a  neurotransmitter, a hormone  and a mitogen.    There are seven  major
   groups of serotonin receptors; six of these groups (5HT1, 5HT2, and 5HT4 to
   5HT7) transduce extracellular signal  by  activating G proteins, while 5HT3
   is a ligand-gated cation-specific ion channel  which, when activated causes
   fast, depolarizing responses in neurons.
 - The glutamate receptor, an excitatory cation channel. Glutamate is the main
   excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.   At  least three different types
   of glutamate receptors have been described and are named according to their
   selective agonists (kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and quisqualate).

All  known sequences of subunits  from neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels are
structurally related.  They are composed of a large extracellular glycosylated
N-terminal ligand-binding domain,  followed by three hydrophobic transmembrane
regions which form the ionic channel, followed  by an intracellular  region of
variable length. A fourth hydrophobic region is found at the C-terminal of the
sequence.

The sequence of subunits  from  the  AchR, GABA,  5HT3, and  Gly receptors are
clearly evolutionary related and  share many regions of sequence similarities.
These sequence  similarities  are  either  absent  or  very  weak  in  the Glu
receptors.

In the N-terminal  extracellular domain of AchR/GABA/5HT3/Gly receptors, there
are two conserved cysteine residues, which, in AchR, have been shown to form a
disulfide bond  essential to the tertiary structure of the receptor.  A number
of amino acids between the two disulfide-bonded  cysteines are also conserved.
We have therefore used this region as a signature pattern for this subclass of
proteins.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-[LIVMFQ]-x-[LIVMF]-x(2)-[FY]-P-x-D-x(3)-C
                    [The 2 C's are linked by a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL the ion-
 gated receptors except for glutamate receptors.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In most AchR subunits and in GABA beta subunits, the residue N-terminal
 to the second cysteine is a N-glycosylated asparagine.
