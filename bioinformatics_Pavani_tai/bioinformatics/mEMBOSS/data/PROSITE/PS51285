* AGC-kinase C-terminal domain profile *
****************************************

The  AGC  (cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent and protein kinase C) protein kinase
family  embraces a collection of protein kinases that display a high degree of
sequence  similarity  within  their  respective  kinase  domains.  AGC  kinase
proteins  are  characterized  by  three  conserved  phosphorylation sites that
critically  regulate their function. The first one is located in an activation
loop  in  the center of the kinase domain. The two other phosphorylation sites
are  located outside the kinase domain in a conserved region on its C-terminal
side,    the   AGC-kinase   C-terminal   domain.   These   sites   serves   as
phosphorylation-regulated  switches to control both intra- and inter-molecular
interactions.   Without   these  priming  phosphorylations,  the  kinases  are
catalytically inactive [1,2,3].

Several  structures  of the AGC-kinase C-terminal domain have been solved (see
for  example  <PDB:1O6L>). The first phosphorylation site is located in a turn
motif the second one at the end of the domain in an hydrophobic pocket. In PKB
the  phosphorylated  hydrophobic motif engages a hydrophobic groove within the
N-lobe  of  the  kinase  domain which orders alpha helices close to the active
site [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire AGC-kinase C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In  some  AGC kinases the C-terminal AGC-kinase domain is also known as
 the PIF domain.
