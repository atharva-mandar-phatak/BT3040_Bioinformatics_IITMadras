* Tify domain profile *
***********************

The tify  domain  is a 36-amino acid domain only found among Embryophyta (land
plants). It  has  been  named  after  the  most  conserved  amino acid pattern
(TIF[F/Y]XG] it  contains.  Because  the use of uppercase characters in 'TIFY'
might imply  that  the  domain is fully conserved across proteins, a lowercase
lettering has  been  chosen  in  an  attempt  to  highlight the reality of its
natural variability.   Based   on   their  domain  architecture,  tify  domain
containing proteins  can  be  classified into two groups. Group I is formed by
proteins possessing   a   CCT   (CONSTANS,  CO-like,  and  TOC1)  domain  (see
<PDOC51017>) and  a GATA-type zinc finger (see <PDOC00300>) in addition to the
tify domain.  Group  II contains proteins characterized by the tify domain but
lacking a  GATA-type  zinc  finger.  Tify  domain containing proteins might be
involved in  developmental  processes  and some of them have features that are
characteristic for  transcription  factors:  a  nuclear  localization  and the
presence of a putative DNA-binding domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain a tify domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis   thaliana   Zinc-finger  protein  expressed  in  Inflorescence
   Meristem (ZIM),  a  putative transcription factor involved in inflorescence
   and flower development [2,3].
 - Arabidopsis thaliana ZIM-like proteins (ZML) [3].
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  PEAPOD1  and  PEAPOD2 (PPD1 and PPD2) [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire tify domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
