* Zinc finger SWIM-type profile *
*********************************

The zinc finger-like domain SWIM was first identified in the bacterial ATPases
of  the  SWI2/SNF2  family,  the  plant  MuDR  transposases and vertebrate MEK
kinase-1.  It  is  represented  in  all  major  lineages  of  prokaryotes  and
eukaryotes.   It   has   the  signature  of  predicted  zinc-binding  residues
C-x-C-x(6,25)-C-x-H   surounded  by  two  blocks  of  conserved  residues,  an
N-terminal  aromatic/hydrophobic  motif  and  a  C-terminal region enriched in
small   and   hydrophobic   residues.  The  SWIM  domain  appears  to  have  a
beta-beta-alpha  structure  suggesting  that  it might adopt a fold similar to
that  of  the  classic C2H2 zinc-finger (see <PDOC00028>). The function of the
SWIM domain is not yet known [1].

Some of the proteins containing a SWIM-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  MEKK-1.  It  is  part  of  the mitogen-activated protein kinase
   cascade.  It interacts  with the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin, 14-3-3
   proteins and c-Jun.
 - Plant  MuDR transposases. The mutator transposon MuDR is one of the largest
   families of mobile elements in plants.
 - Plant nuclear protein FAR1.
 - Bacterial SWI2/SNF2 ATPases.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yehQ.

The profile we developed covers the whole SWIM domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
