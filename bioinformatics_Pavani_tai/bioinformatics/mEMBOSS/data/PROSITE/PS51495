* GLUE domain profile *
***********************

The multivesicular  body  (MVB)  protein-sorting pathway targets transmembrane
proteins either  for degradation or for function in the vacuole/lysosomes. The
signal for  entry  into  this  pathway is monoubiquitination of protein cargo,
which results  in  incorporation  of  cargo  into  luminal  vesicles  at  late
endosomes. Another   crucial   player   is   phosphatidylinositol  3-phosphate
(PtdINS(3)P), which is enriched on early endosomes and on the luminal vesicles
of MVBs.  The  ESCRT  complexes  are  critical  for MVB budding and sorting of
monoubiquitinated cargo  into the luminal vesicles. Various Ub-binding domains
(UBDs), such  as  UIM  (see  <PDOC50330>),  UEV  and  NZF  are  found  in such
machineries. The Vps 36 subunit of the ESCRT-II trafficking complex binds both
phosphoinositides and  ubiquitin.  All  members  of the Vps36 family contain a
divergent GRAM/PH-like  domain  and yeast and some other fungi have one or two
NZF domains  inserted  in  the  GRAM/PH-like domain. This N-terminal region of
Vps36 (EAP45)  has  been named the GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin-binding in EAP45)
domain. The  GLUE  domain  acts  as  a central cog driving the endosomal ESCRT
machinery, through    simultaneous   interactions   with   PtdIns3P-containing
membranes, ubiquitin, and ESCRT-I. Like other known ubiquitin-binding domains,
the GLUE domain interacts with the hydrophobic surface patch of ubiquitin. The
GLUE domain   is   the   first   ubiquitin-binding   domain   shown   to  bind
phosphoinositides, and  the  ability of the same domain to bind both ubiquitin
and a  phosphoinositide  opens  interesting  possibilities for coordination of
membrane interactions and cargo recognition [1,2,3,4,5].

The GLUE  domain  has  a split PH-domain fold  with two curved beta sheets and
one long  alpha helix (see <PDB:2CAY>). The two sheets (beta1-beta4 and beta5-
beta7) form  a beta barrel-like structure,The C-terminal alpha helix is wedged
between the  two  beta  sheets,  covering  a  hydrophobic core. The Vps36 GLUE
domain binds   PtdIns3P   via  a  positively  charged  lipid  binding  pocket,
delineated by the variable loops beta1/beta2, beta5/beta6 and beta7/alpha1, in
contrast to  the  vast  majority  of  characterized  PH  domains,  which use a
different lipid binding pocket [2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire GLUE domain.
