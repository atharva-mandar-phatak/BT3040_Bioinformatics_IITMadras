The endosomal  sorting  complex  required for transport (ESCRT) complexes form
the machinery  driving  protein  sorting  from  endosomes  to lysosomes. ESCRT
complexes are  central  to  receptor  downregulation, lysosome biogenesis, and
budding of  HIV.  Yeast  ESCRT-I  consists  of  three protein subunits, VPS23,
VPS28, and  VPS37. In humans, ESCRT-I comprises TSG101, VPS28, and one of four
potential human  VPS37  homologs.  The  main  role  of ESCRT-I is to recognize
ubiquitinated cargo  via  the  UEV  domain  of  the  VPS23/TSG101 subunit. The
assembly of  the  ESCRT-I complex is directed by the C-terminal steadiness box
(SB) of VPS23, the N-terminal half of VPS28, and the C-terminal half of VPS37.
The structure  is primarily composed of three long, parallel helical hairpins,
each corresponding  to  a  different  subunit (see <PDB:2CAZ>). The additional
domains and  motifs  extending  beyond  the  core  serve as gripping tools for
ESCRT-I critical functions [1,2].

The profiles  we  developed  cover the entire steadiness box, VPS28 N-terminal
and VPS37 C-terminal domains.
