* RGS domain profile *
**********************

Regulators of  G-protein  signaling  (RGS)  proteins  are  a  family of highly
diverse, multifunctional  signaling  proteins  that  are  found  in eukaryotic
species ranging  from yeast to mammals. They act as GTPase activating proteins
(GAPs) that  reduce  the  signal  transmitted  by  the receptor-activated (GTP
bound) G-alpha  subunit  by  rapidly  returning  it to the inactive state (GDP
bound). Although  they are a diverse group of proteins, all RGS family members
share a  conserved 120 amino acid domain, the RGS domain. The RGS domain binds
to activated  G-alpha subunits and is responsible for GAP function. Apart from
the RGS  domain,  RGS  proteins  differ widely in their overall size and amino
acid identity  and  possess  a  remarkable  variety  of structural domains and
motifs. These   additional  domains,  like  DEP  (see  <PDOC50186>,  PDZ  (see
<PDOC50106> or  PH  (see <PDOC50003>, link the RGS proteins to other signaling
network, where they constitute effector type molecules [1,2,3].

RGS domains  are  broken  up  into  three  highly  conserved  GH  (GAIP or GOS
homology) subdomains (GH1, GH2 and GH3), which can be either nearly contiguous
or widely  dispersed  within  nonconserved  sequences  [3].  Resolution of the
crystal structure of the RGS4 protein complexed with a stable transition state
mimic of G-alpha-GTP has revealed that the RGS domain forms nine alpha-helices
that fold into two small subdomains. These subdomains each contact the G-alpha
surface at three distinct sites [4].

Some proteins known to contain a RGS domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins.
 - Mammalian G-alpha interacting protein (GAIP).
 - Mammalian  G-protein-coupled-receptor kinases (GRK), proteins that directly
   phosphorylate GPCRs to regulate signaling.
 - Animal  axin/conductin,  an  inhibitor of the wg/wnt signaling pathway. The
   RGS domain   of   axin/conductin   interacts   with  the  tumour-suppressor
   adenomatous polyposis   coli  (APC),  a  non-G-alpha-like  molecule,  which
   indicates that some RGS domains can bind to proteins other than G-alpha.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  egl-10,  which  regulates  G  protein signaling in
   nervous system.
 - Drosophila Loco, a protein required for glial differentiation.
 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  SST2,  a  negative  regulator  of the G protein-
   coupled mating pheromone signaling pathway.

We have developed a profile that covers the entire RGS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
