* Coronavirus main protease (M-pro) domain profile *
****************************************************

Coronaviruses (CoVs)  are positive-stranded RNA viruses that can infect humans
and multiple species of animals, causing a wide spectrum of diseases [E1]. The
CoV replicase  gene  encodes  two  overlapping  polyproteins,  termed pp1a and
pp1ab, which  mediate  viral  replication and transcription. The maturation of
CoVs involves a highly complex cascade of proteolytic processing events on the
polyproteins to control viral gene expression and replication. Most maturation
cleavage events  within  the  precursor  polyprotein  are  mediated by a viral
cysteine proteinase   which  is  called  the  'main  proteinase'  (M-pro)  or,
alternatively, the  '3C-like  proteinase'  (3CL-pro).  The ~300-residue mature
form of  the M-pro is released from pp1a and pp1ab by autoproteolytic cleavage
and employs  conserved  cysteine  and histidine residues in the catalytic site
[1,2,3,4]. It belongs to peptidase family C30 [E2].

The CoV  M-pro  comprises three domains (see <PDB:1LVO>). Domains I and II are
six-stranded antiparallel beta barrels and together ressemble the architecture
of chymotrypsin  and  of  picornaviruses 3C proteinases. The substrate-binding
site is  located  in  a cleft between these two domains. The catalytic site is
situated at  the center of the cleft. A long loop connects domain II to the C-
terminal domain  (domain  III). This latter domain, a globular cluster of five
helices, has  been  implicated  in  the  proteolytic activity of M-pro. In the
active site of M-pro, Cys and His form a catalytic dyad. In contrast to serine
proteinases and  other  cysteine  proteinases,  which  have a catalytic triad,
there is no third catalytic residue present [1,2,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire M-pro domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
