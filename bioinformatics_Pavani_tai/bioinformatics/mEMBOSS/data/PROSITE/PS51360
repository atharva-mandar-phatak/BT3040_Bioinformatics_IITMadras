* Plus3 domain profile *
************************

The yeast  Paf1  complex  consists  of  Pfa1,  Rtf1, Cdc73, Ctr9, and Leo1 and
regulates histone  H2B  ubiquitination, histone H3 methylation, RNA polymerase
II carboxy-terminal   domain  (CTD)  Ser2  phosphorylation,  and  RNA  3'  end
processing. The conservation of Paf1 complex function in higher eukaryotes has
been confirmed  in  human  cells, Drosophila and Arabidopsis. The Plus3 domain
spans the  most  conserved  regions  of  the Rtf1 protein and is surrounded by
regions of  low  complexity  and  coiled-coil  propensity.  It contains only a
limited number  of  highly  conserved  amino  acids,  among  which  are  three
positively charged  residues that gave the Plus3 domain its name. The capacity
to bind single-stranded DNA is at least one function of the Plus3 domain [1].

The Plus3  domain  structure  consists  of  six  alpha helices intervened by a
sequence of  six beta strands in a mixed alpha/beta topology (see <PDB:2BZE>).
Beta strands  1,  2,  5, and 6 compose a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet
with a  beta-hairpin  insertion  formed  by  strands  3  and 4. The N-terminal
helices alpha1-alpha3  and  C-terminal  helix  alpha6 pack together to form an
alpha subdomain, while the beta strands and the small 3(10) helix alpha 4 form
a beta subdomain. The two subdomains pack together to form a compact, globular
protein [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire Plus3 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
