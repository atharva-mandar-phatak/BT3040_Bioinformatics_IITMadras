* Lipoate-protein ligase B signature *
**************************************

Lipoate-protein ligase  B [1] (gene lipB) is the bacterial enzyme that creates
an amide  linkage  that  joins  the  free carboxyl group of lipoic acid to the
epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue in lipoate-dependent enzymes.

Such an  enzyme  has  also  be  found in fungi [2], where it is located in the
mitochondria. It  also  seems  to  exist  in  plants  and  is  encoded  in the
chloroplast genome of the red alga Cyanidium caldarium.

As a signature for lipB, we selected the most conserved region, located in the
central part  of  the  enzyme.  This  region  contains  one  of  two conserved
histidines.

-Consensus pattern: R-G(2)-x(2)-T-[FYWCAH]-H-x(2)-[GHS]-Q-x-[LIVMT]-x-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
