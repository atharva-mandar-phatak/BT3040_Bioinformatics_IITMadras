* Bacterial type II secretion system protein F signature *
**********************************************************

A number  of  bacterial  proteins,  some  of  which  are involved in a general
secretion pathway  (GSP) for the export  of  proteins (also called the type II
pathway) [1], have  been  found to be evolutionary related. These proteins are
listed below.

 - The    'F'   protein from the GSP operon of: Aeromonas (gene exeF); Erwinia
   (gene outF);  Escherichia  coli  (gene  hofF);  Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene
   pulF); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gene xcpS);  Vibrio cholerae (gene epsF) and
   Xanthomonas campestris (gene xpsF).
 - Bacillus subtilis comG operon protein 2 which is required for the uptake of
   DNA by competent Bacillus subtilis cells.
 - Aeromonas hydrophila tapC, involved in type IV pilus assembly.
 - Pseudomonas protein pilC, which is essential for the formation of the pili.
 - Vibrio cholerae protein tcpE, which  is involved in the biosynthesis of the
   tcp pilus.
 - Escherichia coli protein hofC (hopC).

These are  proteins  of  about 400 amino acids that are highly hydrophobic and
which are thought to be integral protein of the inner membrane. As a signature
pattern we selected a conserved region in the central part of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [KRQ]-[LIVMAW]-x(2)-[SAIV]-[LIVM]-x-[TY]-P-x(2)-[LIVM]-
                    x(3)-[STAGV]-x(6)-[LMY]-x(3)-[LIVMF](2)-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
