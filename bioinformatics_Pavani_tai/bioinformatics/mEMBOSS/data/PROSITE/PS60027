* Contryphan family signature *
*******************************

Contryphans are a family of short disulfide constrained peptides isolated from
various species  of  cone  shell. They constitute a group of conopeptides that
are known  to  contain  an unusual density of post-translational modifications
including tryptophan   bromination,   amidation  of  the  C-terminal  residue,
leucine, and tryptophan isomerization, proline hydroxylation and glutamic acid
gamma-carboxylation [1-5].

Contryphans share  the  conserved  sequence  motif,  CP*(D-W or D-L)XPWC, that
includes a  tryptophan  or  leucine  in  the  D-conformation, a disulfide bond
between the  two  cysteines,  and  in  some cases hydroxylation of the proline
preceding the D-Trp residue, Pro*. The N-terminal Cys-Pro/Hyp (hydroxyproline)
peptide bond exhibits cis-trans isomerization in most contryphans; however the
more abundant   cis  isomer  is  believed  to  be  the  functionally  relevant
conformer. The  contryphan fold consists of a seven residue loop stabilized by
a disulfide bridge (see <PDB:1DFY> and <PDB:1DFZ>) [1,3,5].

This family includes:

 - Contryphan-P and Leu-contryphan-P from Conus purpurascens (Purple cone).
 - Contryphan-Tx,  contryphan-R/Tx  and  Leu-contryphan-Tx  from Conus textile
   (Cloth-of-gold cone) [2].
 - Glacontryphan-M  from  Conus  marmoreus  (Marble cone), a calcium-dependent
   inhibitor of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels [4,5].
 - Contryphan from Conus radiatus (Rayed cone).
 - Contryphan-Sm from Conus stercusmuscarum (Fly-specked cone) [1].
 - Contryphan-Vn from Conus ventricosus (Mediterranean cone) [3].

We have developed a pattern that contains the two conserved cysteines.

-Conserved pattern: C-[PV]-[WL]-x-P-[YW]-C-x(0,1)>
                    [The 2 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
