* NHL repeat profile *
**********************

The NHL repeat was defined by amino acid sequence homologies among Ncl-1, HT2A
and  Lin-41  proteins  [1].  NHL  is a conserved structural motif present in a
large family of growth regulator. Many NHL containing proteins have additional
domains  such  as  a  RING  finger (see <PDOC00449>), a B-box zinc finger (see
<PDOC50119>)  or  a  coiled-coil motif. According to structural model analysis
the NHL domain could be involved in protein-protein interaction [2].

The NHL  domain  is  a six-bladed beta-propeller, with the blades arrayed in a
radial fashion  around  a  central  axis,  and each blade composed of a highly
twisted four  stranded  antiparallel  beta-sheet  (see  <PDB:1Q7F>)  [2].  The
innermost strand  of  each blade is labeled 'a' and the outermost strand, 'd'.
Like in  other beta-propellers the sequence repeats are offset with respect to
the blades  of  the propeller, such that any given 40-residue NHL repeat spans
strands 'b-d'  of  one propeller blade and strand 'a' of the subsequent blade.
This offset  ensures  circularization of the propeller because the last strand
of the  final  sequence repeat acts as an innermost strand a of the blade that
harbors strands 'b-d' from the first sequence repeat.

The profile we developed  covers the whole NHL sequence repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
