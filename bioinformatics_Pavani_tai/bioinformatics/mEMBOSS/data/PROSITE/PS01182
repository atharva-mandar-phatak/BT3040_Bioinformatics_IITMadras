* Glycosyl hydrolases family 35 putative active site *
******************************************************

Beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) from mammals, fungi, plants and the bacteria
Xanthomonas manihotis are evolutionary related [1,2]. They belong to family 35
in the classification of glycosyl hydrolases [3,E1].

Mammalian beta-galactosidase  is  a lysosomal enzyme (gene GLB1) which cleaves
the terminal     galactose     from     gangliosides,    glycoproteins,    and
glycosaminoglycans and  whose  deficiency  is the cause of the genetic disease
Gm(1) gangliosidosis (Morquio disease type B).

On of  the  best  conserved  regions in these enzymes contains a glutamic acid
residue which,  on the basis of similarities with  other  families of glycosyl
hydrolases [4], probably acts as the proton donor in the  catalytic mechanism.
We use this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: G-G-P-[LIVM](2)-x(2)-Q-x-E-N-E-[FY]
                    [The second E may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
