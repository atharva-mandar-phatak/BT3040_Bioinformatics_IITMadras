* Bacterial extracellular solute-binding proteins, family 1 signature *
***********************************************************************

Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active  transport of
solutes across  the  cytoplasmic  membrane.  The  protein  components of these
traffic systems  include  one  or two transmembrane protein components, one or
two membrane-associated    ATP-binding   proteins   (ABC   transporters;   see
<PDOC00185>) and a high affinity periplasmic solute-binding protein. The later
are thought  to  bind the substrate in the vicinity of the inner membrane, and
to transfer  it to a complex of inner membrane proteins for concentration into
the cytoplasm.

In gram-positive  bacteria  which are surrounded by a single membrane and have
therefore no  periplasmic  region  the  equivalent  proteins  are bound to the
membrane via an N-terminal lipid anchor. These homolog proteins do not play an
integral role in the transport process per se, but probably serve as receptors
to trigger  or  initiate  translocation of the solute  through the membrane by
binding to  external  sites  of  the  integral membrane proteins of the efflux
system.

In addition  at  least some solute-binding proteins function in the initiation
of sensory transduction pathways.

On the  basis  of  sequence  similarities,  the vast majority of these solute-
binding proteins  can  be  grouped  [1] into eight families of clusters, which
generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.

Family 1 currently includes the following proteins:

 - Periplasmic  maltose/maltodextrin-binding  proteins  of  Enterobacteriaceae
   (gene malE)  and  homologous  lipoprotein in Streptococcus pneumoniae (gene
   malX).
 - Periplasmic  multiple  oligo-saccharide  binding  protein  of Streptococcus
   mutans (gene msmE), which is involved in the uptake of melibiose, raffinose
   and isomaltotriose.
 - Periplasmic  glycerol-3-phosphate-binding  protein  of  Escherichia coli, a
   component of   the   phosphate-limitation   inducible   uptake  system  for
   sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerophosphoryl diesters.
 - Periplasmic  iron-binding  protein from Serratia marcescens (gene sfuA) and
   the homologous   proteins   (gene  fbp)  from  Haemophilus  influenzae  and
   Neisseria, which are part of the iron-acquisition system.
 - Periplasmic thiamine-binding  protein (gene tbpA) from Escherichia coli and
   Haemophilus influenzae.

The signature  pattern  for  this  family is located in the central section of
the mature proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [GAP]-[LIVMFA]-[STAVDN]-x-{H}-x(2)-[GSAV]-[LIVMFY](2)-Y-
                    [ND]-x(3)-[LIVMF]-x-[KNDE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
