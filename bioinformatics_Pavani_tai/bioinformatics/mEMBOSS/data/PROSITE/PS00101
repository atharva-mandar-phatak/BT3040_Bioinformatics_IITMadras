* Hexapeptide-repeat containing-transferases signature *
********************************************************

On the  basis  of  sequence  similarity,  a  number  of transferases have been
proposed [1,2,3,4] to belong to a single family. These proteins are:

 - Serine  O-acetyltransferase  (EC  2.3.1.30)  (SAT)  (gene cysE),  an enzyme
   involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
 - Azotobacter  chroococcum  nitrogen  fixation  protein  nifP.  NifP  is most
   probably a SAT involved in the optimization of nitrogenase activity.
 - Escherichia coli  thiogalactoside   acetyltransferase  (EC 2.3.1.18)  (gene
   lacA), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lactose.
 - UDP-N-acetylglucosamine  acyltransferase   (EC 2.3.1.129)  (gene  lpxA), an
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a phosphorylated glycolipid
   that anchors the lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane of the cell.
 - UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl]  glucosamine  N-acyltransferase  (EC  2.3.1.-)
   (gene lpxD or firA), which is also involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A.
 - Chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferase (CAT) (EC 2.3.1.28) from  Agrobacterium
   tumefaciens,  Bacillus sphaericus,  Escherichia coli  plasmid  IncFII NR79,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pIP630. These CAT are
   not evolutionary related to the main family of CAT (see <PDOC00093>).
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodL. NodL is an acetyltransferase involved in
   the O-acetylation of Nod factors.
 - Bacterial maltose O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.79).
 - Bacterial tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.117) (gene
   dapD) which   catalyzes   the   fourth   step   in   the   biosynthesis  of
   diaminopimelate and lysine from aspartate semialdehyde.
 - Bacterial  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate  uridyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.23)
   (gene glmU  or  gcaD  or  tms),    an  enzyme involved in peptidoglycan and
   lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
 - Staphylococcus  aureus  protein  capG  which is involved in biosynthesis of
   type 1 capsular polysaccharide.
 - Yeast  hypothetical protein YJL218w, which is highly similar to Escherichia
   coli lacA.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC18B11.09c.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ1064.

These proteins have been shown [3,4] to contain a repeat structure composed of
tandem repeats  of a [LIV]-G-x(4) hexapeptide which, in the tertiary structure
of lpxA  [5],  has  been shown to form a left-handed parallel beta helix.  Our
signature pattern is based on a fourfold repeat of this hexapeptide.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[GAED]-x(2)-[STAV]-x-[LIV]-x(3)-[LIVAC]-x-[LIV]-
                    [GAED]-x(2)-[STAVR]-x-[LIV]-[GAED]-x(2)-[STAV]-x-[LIV]-
                    x(3)-[LIV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
