* Neuralized homology repeat (NHR) domain profile *
***************************************************

The neuralized  homology  repeat (NHR) domain is a module of ~160 amino acids,
which has  been  identified  as  a  tandem  repeat in drosophila neuralized, a
protein involved  in  development of the central and peripheral nervous system
[1]. Several  other  fly,  worm,  and  mammalian neuralized-like proteins were
found to  contain  between  one  and  six  NHR  domains  associated with other
modules, such  as  RING  (see  <PDOC00449>),  SOCS  (see <PDOC50225>), or SPRY
[2,3]. It  has  been  suggested  that  the  NHR  domain  is  required  for the
localization of neuralized to the plasma membrane [4]. As it has been proposed
that NHR  domains  do  partly  resemble  SPRY domains, it is possible that NHR
possess microtubule-binding  functions,  similar  to  those  proposed for SPRY
domains [3].

Some proteins known to contain a NHR domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila neuralized protein. It is involved in neurogenesis and interacts
   with other  neurogenic  proteins  in  the  specification  of the neuroblast
   versus epidermoblast cell fate.
 - Mammalian  neuralized-like  protein  2.  It  plays an important role in the
   process of myofiber differentiation and maturation.

The profile we developed covers the entire NHR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The NHR domain has also been called NEUZ domain [2,3].
