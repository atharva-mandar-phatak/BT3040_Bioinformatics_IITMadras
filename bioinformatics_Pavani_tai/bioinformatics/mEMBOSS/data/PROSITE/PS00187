* Thiamine pyrophosphate enzymes signature *
********************************************

A number of enzymes  require  thiamine  pyrophosphate  (TPP) (vitamin B1) as a
cofactor.  It has been shown [1] that  some  of these enzymes are structurally
related. These related TPP enzymes are:

 - Pyruvate oxidase (POX) (EC 1.2.3.3)
   Reaction catalyzed: pyruvate + orthophosphate + O(2) + H(2)O = acetyl
   phosphate + CO(2) + H(2)O(2).
 - Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) (EC 4.1.1.1)
   Reaction catalyzed: pyruvate = acetaldehyde + CO(2).
 - Indolepyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.74) [2]
   Reaction catalyzed: indole-3-pyruvate = indole-3-acetaldehyde + CO(2).
 - Acetolactate synthase (ALS) (EC 2.2.1.6)
   Reaction catalyzed: 2 pyruvate = acetolactate + CO(2).
 - Benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFD) (EC 4.1.1.7) [3]
   Reaction catalyzed: benzoylformate = benzaldehyde + CO(2).

As  a signature pattern for these enzymes we  have selected a conserved region
which is located in their C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-[GSA]-x(5)-P-x(4)-[LIVMFYW]-x-[LIVMF]-x-G-D-[GSA]-
                    [GSAC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 13 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: a hypothetical  protein in the  puf
 photosynthesis operon of Rhodobacter capsulatus;  this protein could be a TPP
 enzyme.

-Note: Other TPP enzymes  such as the E1  component of pyruvate  dehydrogenase
 complex, 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate  synthase, and
 transketolase do not seem to be related to the above enzymes.

-Last update: November 1995 / Pattern and text revised.
