*********************************
* Zinc finger CXXC-type profile *
*********************************

Methylation   of  cytosine  within  the  dinucleotide  CpG  is  essential  for
vertebrate  development and is correlated to gene silencing. Sequence analyses
on   various   mammalian  proteins  linked  to  DNA  methylation  led  to  the
identification of a conserved cysteine rich region with the consensus sequence
C-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(5)-C-x(2)-C-x(2)-C,  the  CXXC-type  zinc finger [1,2]. This
zinc finger can bind specifically to non-methylated CpG DNA but failed to bind
to methylated CpG motifs [3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a CXXC-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Mammalian DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase protein 1.
 - Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1 (MBD1).
 - Human Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein (also known as all1, htrx, trx1,
   or  hrx).  The  MLL  gene  is  a frequent target for chromosomal aberration
   associated with leukemia. In the majority of leukemias with altered MLL the
   complete C-terminus is removed by chromosomal translocation and replaced in
   frame  by  a variety of different fusion partners. The N-terminal CXXC-type
   zinc  finger of MLL is essential for the oncongenic activity of various MLL
   fusion proteins [4,5].
 - Human  CpG binding protein hCGBP, an activator of genes residing within CpG
   islands.

The profile we developed covers the whole CXXC-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
