* Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase signatures *
***************************************************

Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107) (SUMT) [1,2] catalyzes the
transfer of two methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine  to the C-2 and C-7
atoms of  uroporphyrinogen  III  to  yield  precorrin-2  via  the intermediate
formation of precorrin-1. SUMT is the first enzyme specific to  the  cobalamin
pathway  and  precorrin-2 is a common  intermediate  in  the  biosynthesis  of
corrinoids such as vitamin B12, siroheme and coenzyme F430.

The sequences  of  SUMT  from  a  variety  of  eubacterial and archaebacterial
species are currently available. In species  such as Bacillus megaterium (gene
cobA), Pseudomonas  denitrificans  (cobA)  or  Methanobacterium ivanovii (gene
corA) SUMT is a protein of  about 25 to 30 Kd. In Escherichia coli and related
bacteria, the cysG protein, which is involved in the biosynthesis of siroheme,
is a  multifunctional  protein  composed  of  a  N-terminal  domain,  probably
involved in  transforming  precorrin-2  into siroheme, and a C-terminal domain
which has SUMT activity.

The sequence of SUMT is  related  to  that  of  a  number  of P. denitrificans
and Salmonella  typhimurium  enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin
which also  seem  to be SAM-dependent methyltransferases [3,4]. The similarity
is especially  strong  with two of these enzymes: cobI/cbiL which  encodes  S-
adenosyl-L-methionine--precorrin-2 methyltransferase and cobM/cbiF whose exact
function is not known.

We developed  two  signature patterns for these enzymes. The first corresponds
to a well conserved region in the N-terminal extremity (called region 1 in [1,
3]) and  the  second to a less conserved region located in the central part of
these proteins (this pattern spans what are called regions 2 and 3 in [1,3]).

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[GS]-[STAL]-G-P-G-x(3)-[LIVMFY]-[LIVM]-T-[LIVM]-
                    [KRHQG]-[AG]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [VW]-x(2)-[LI]-x(2)-[GA]-[DT]-x(3)-[FYW]-[GS]-x(8)-
                    [LIVFA]-x(5,6)-[LIVMFYWPAC]-x-[LIVMY]-x-[PN]-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Yeast  diphthine  synthase  (EC  2.1.1.98)  (gene DPH5) seems to be [5]
 evolutionary related to SUMT, but is not detected by the above patterns.
