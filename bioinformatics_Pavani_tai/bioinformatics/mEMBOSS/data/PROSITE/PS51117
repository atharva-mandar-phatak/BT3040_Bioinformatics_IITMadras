* Laminin N-terminal (LN) domain profile *
******************************************

Laminin  is  a  large  molecular  weight glycoprotein present only in basement
membranes  in  almost  every  animal  tissue.  Each  laminin is a heterotrimer
assembled from alpha, beta and gamma chain subunits, secreted and incorporated
into  cell-associated  extracellular matrices [1].

Basement  membrane  assembly  is  a  cooperative  process  in  which  laminins
polymerize through their N-terminal domain (LN or domain VI) and anchor to the
cell  surface  through  their  G  domains  (see <PDOC50025>). Netrins may also
associate  with  this  network through heterotypic LN domain interactions [2].
This  leads to cell signaling through integrins and dystroglycan (and possibly
other  receptors)  recruited to the adherent laminin. This LN domain dependent
self-assembly  is  considered  to  be  crucial  for  the integrity of basement
membranes,  as  highlighted  by genetic forms of muscular dystrophy containing
the deletion of the LN module from the alpha 2 laminin chain [3].

The  laminin  N-terminal  domain  is  found in all laminin and netrin subunits
except laminin alpha 3A, alpha 4 and gamma 2.

The profile we developed covers the whole laminin N-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
