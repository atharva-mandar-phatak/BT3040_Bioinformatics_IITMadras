* Electron transfer flavoprotein alpha-subunit signature *
**********************************************************

The electron  transfer flavoprotein (ETF) [1,2] serves as a  specific electron
acceptor for various mitochondrial dehydrogenases.  ETF transfers electrons to
the  main  respiratory chain  via  ETF-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase.  ETF  is an
heterodimer that consist of  an  alpha  and  a beta subunit and which bind one
molecule of FAD per dimer. A similar system also exists in some bacteria.

The alpha subunit of ETF  is a  protein of  about  32 Kd which is structurally
related to  the  bacterial  nitrogen  fixation protein fixB which could play a
role in a redox process and feed electrons to ferredoxin.

Other related proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydiR.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygcQ.

As  a signature  pattern  for these  proteins  we  selected a highly conserved
region which is located in the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [LI]-Y-[LIVM]-[AT]-x-[GA]-[IV]-[SD]-G-x-[IV]-Q-[HP]-x(2)-
                    G-x(6)-[IV]-x-A-[IV]-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ygcQ.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
