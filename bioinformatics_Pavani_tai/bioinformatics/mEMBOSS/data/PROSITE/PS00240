************************************************
* Receptor tyrosine kinase class III signature *
************************************************

A number of growth factors  stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a family
of   cell  surface receptors which   possess  an  intrinsic, ligand-sensitive,
protein tyrosine kinase activity [1].   These  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
all share the same topology: an  extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single
transmembrane  region and a cytoplasmic  kinase domain.   However  they can be
classified into at least five groups.   The class III RTK's are  characterized
by the  presence  of  five  to  seven immunoglobulin-like domains [2] in their
extracellular section. Their kinase domain differs from that of other RTK's by
the insertion of a stretch of 70 to 100 hydrophilic residues in  the middle of
this domain. The receptors currently known to belong to class III are:

 - Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R).  PDGF-R exists as a homo-
   or heterodimer of two related chains: alpha and beta [3].
 - Macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1-R)  (also known as the
   fms oncogene).
 - Stem cell factor (mast cell growth factor) receptor  (also known as the kit
   oncogene).
 - Vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF) receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR
   [4].
 - Fl cytokine receptor Flk-2/Flt-3 [5].
 - The putative receptor Flt-4 [6].

We developed  a  signature pattern for this class of RTK's which is based on a
conserved region in the kinase domain.

-Consensus pattern: G-x-H-x-N-[LIVM]-V-N-L-L-G-A-C-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
