***********************************************

RNA 3'-terminal  phosphate cyclase (EC 6.5.1.4) [1,2] catalyzes the conversion
of 3'-phosphate  to  a  2',3'-cyclic  phosphodiester  at  the  end of RNA. The
biological role of this enzyme is unknown but it is likely to function in some
aspects of cellular RNA processing.

The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme occurs in three steps:

 1) adenylation of the enzyme by ATP;
 2) the  enzyme  acts  on  RNA-3'terminal  phosphate to produce RNA-3'terminal
    diphosphate adenylate;
 3) Release  of  AMP and cyclisation by a non catalytic nucleophilic attack by
    the adjacent 2'hydroxyl on the phosphorus in the diester linkage.

This enzyme, which has been characterized in human (where there seems to be at
least three   isozymes)   and  Escherichia  coli  (gene  rtCA),  seems  to  be
taxonomically widespread.  It is found in insects, plants, fungi (gene RTC1 in
yeast) and in archeabacteria.

RNA cyclase is a protein of from 36 to 42 Kd. The best conserved region, which
we use  as  a signature pattern, is a glycine-rich stretch of residues located
in the  central  part of the sequence and which is reminiscent of various ATP,
GTP or  AMP glycine-rich loops. In this context, the conserved Arg (His in the
E.coli enzyme) could be the AMP-binding residue.
