* Insulin family signature *
****************************

The insulin  family  of  proteins [1] groups a number of active peptides which
are evolutionary related. This family currently consists of:

 - Insulin.
 - Relaxin.
 - Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGFs or somatomedins) [2].
 - Mammalian Leydig cell-specific insulin-like peptide (Ley-I-L)  (gene INSL3)
   [3].
 - Mammalian early placenta insulin-likepeptide (ELIP) (gene INSL4) [4].
 - Insulin-like peptide 5 (gene INSL5).
 - Insect prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) (bombyxin) [5].
 - Locust insulin-related peptide (LIRP) [6].
 - Molluscan insulin-related peptides 1 to 5 (MIP) [7].
 - Caenorhabditis elegans insulin-like peptides [8].

Structurally, all  these peptides consist of two polypeptide  chains (A and B)
linked by two disulfide bonds.

                              |            |

'*': position of the pattern.

As  shown in the  schematic representation above,  they  all share a conserved
arrangement of four cysteines in their A  chain.  The first of these cysteines
is  linked by a  disulfide bond to  the third  one  and  the second and fourth
cysteines  are linked  by interchain  disulfide bonds to  cysteines  in  the B
chain.   As  a  pattern  for this family of  proteins, we have used the region
which includes the four conserved cysteines in the A chain.

-Consensus pattern: C-C-{P}-{P}-x-C-[STDNEKPI]-x(3)-[LIVMFS]-x(3)-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for what was thought to be a sponge insulin [9], but which originates from an
 unidentified rodent and which contains  sequencing errors and lacks the first
 cysteine of the A chain.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
