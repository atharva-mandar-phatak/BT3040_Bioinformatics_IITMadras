* Glutaredoxin active site signature and domain profile *
*********************************************************

Glutaredoxin [1,2,3],  also known as thioltransferase,  is  a small protein of
approximately one  hundred  amino-acid  residues.  It functions as an electron
carrier in  the glutathione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by the
enzyme  ribonucleotide  reductase.  Like  thioredoxin,  which  functions  in a
similar way, glutaredoxin possesses an active center disulfide bond. It exists
in either  a  reduced  or an oxidized form where the two cysteine residues are
linked in an intramolecular disulfide bond.

Glutaredoxin has  been  sequenced  in  a  variety  of species. On the basis of
extensive sequence similarity, it has  been proposed [4] that vaccinia protein
O2L is  most  probably a glutaredoxin. Finally, it must be noted that phage T4
thioredoxin seems also to be evolutionary related.

The  pattern is directed against the 2 cysteines of the redox active bonds. We
also developed a profile that covers the whole glutaredoxin domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMD]-[FYSA]-x(4)-C-[PV]-[FYWH]-C-x(2)-[TAV]-x(2,3)-
                    [LIV]
                    [The 2 C's form the redox-active bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In position 5 of the pattern, all glutaredoxin sequences have Pro while
 T4 thioredoxin has Val.

-Last update: December 2007 / Text revised and profile added.
