* Spermidine/spermine synthases family signature and profile *
**************************************************************

The nearly  ubiquitous  polyamines  (putrescine,  spermidine and spermine) are
polycationic mediators   of   cell  proliferation  and  differentiation  whose
functions likely  provide both stability and neutralization for nucleic acids.
The following polyamine biosynthetic enzymes are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Spermidine  synthase  (EC 2.5.1.16) (putrescine aminopropyltransferase). It
   catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of spermidine from arginine and
   methionine; the conversion of putrescine to spermidine using decarboxylated
   S-adenosylmethionine as the cofactor.
 - Spermine  synthase  (EC  2.5.1.22)  (spermidine aminopropyltransferase). It
   converts spermidine into spermine using decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine
   as the cofactor.
 - Putrescine  N-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.53). It catalyzes a step in the
   biosynthesis of  nicotine  in  plants;  the methylation of putrescine to N-
   methylputrescine using S-adenosylmethionine as the cofactor.

The Thermotoga  maritima  spermidine synthase monomer consists of two domains:
an N-terminal  domain  composed  of  six  beta-strands, and a Rossmann-like C-
terminal domain  (see <PDB:1INL>). The larger C-terminal catalytic core domain
consists of  a  seven-stranded  beta-sheet flanked by nine alpha helices. This
domain resembles   a   topology   observed  in  a  number  of  nucleotide  and
dinucleotide-binding enzymes,   and   in   S-adenosyl-L-methionine   (AdoMet)-
dependent methyltransferase (MTases) [2].

As a  signature  pattern, we selected a glycine-rich conserved region. We also
developed a  profile  that  spans  both  the  N-terminal  and  the  C-terminal
catalytic domains.
