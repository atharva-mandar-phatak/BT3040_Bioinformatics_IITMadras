* Vinculin family signatures *
******************************

Vinculin [1] is  a eukaryotic  protein  that  seems  to  be  involved  in  the
attachment of the actin-based microfilaments to the plasma membrane.  Vinculin
is located  at  the cytoplasmic  side  of  focal contacts or adhesion plaques.
In addition to actin, vinculin interacts  with  other structural proteins such
as talin and alpha-actinins.

Vinculin is a large protein of 116 Kd (about a 1000 residues).    Structurally
the protein  consists of an  acidic N-terminal domain of about 90 Kd separated
from a basic C-terminal  domain  of  about  25 Kd by  a proline-rich region of
about 50 residues.  The  central part of  the  N-terminal domain consists of a
variable number (3 in vertebrates, 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans)  of repeats of
a 110 amino acids domain.

Catenins [2] are  proteins  that  associate with  the  cytoplasmic domain of a
variety of cadherins. The  association  of  catenins to  cadherins  produces a
complex which is linked  to the actin filament network, and which  seems to be
of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion properties.  Three different
types  of  catenins seem to exist: alpha, beta, and gamma.  Alpha-catenins are
proteins of about 100 Kd which  are  evolutionary  related  to  vinculin.   In
term of their structure  the most significant  differences are the absence, in
alpha-catenin, of the repeated domain and of the proline-rich segment.

We developed two signature patterns  for  this family of proteins.   The first
pattern is located in the  N-terminal  section  of  both  vinculin  and alpha-
catenins and is part, in vinculin, of a domain that seems to be  involved with
the interaction with talin.  The second pattern is based on a conserved region
in the N-terminal part of the repeated domain of vinculin.

-Consensus pattern: [KR]-x-[LIVMF]-x(3)-[LIVMA]-x(2)-[LIVM]-x(6)-R-Q-Q-E-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[QA]-A-x(2)-W-[IL]-x-[DN]-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: vinculins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Note: This pattern will pick up all copies of the repeated domain.

-Last update: June 1994 / Patterns and text revised.
