* ArsR-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  arsR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of about 90-100 amino acids present in transcription regulators of the
arsR/smtB family, involved in stress-response to heavy metal ions. This family
of   prokaryotic   metal-sensing   transcription  repressors  is  named  after
Escherichia  coli  arsR, an arsenic-responsive repressor of the ars operon for
arsenate  reductase  and metal ion extrusion, and after Synechococcus PCC 7942
smtB,  a  Zn(II)-responsive  repressor  of the smtA gene for a Zn sequestering
metallothionein  [1].  ArsR/smtB-like  repressors  of metal resistance operons
specifically bind to the operator/promoter and seem to dissociate from the DNA
in  the  presence of metal ions, permitting transcription of proteins involved
in  metal-ions  efflux  and/or  detoxification.  The arsR/smtB family includes
transcription  repressors  responsive  to  Zn(II),  As(III),  Cd(II),  Pb(II),
Bi(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) [1,2].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  cyanobacterial  smtB  shows  a  fold of five
alpha-helices  (H) and a pair of antiparallel beta-strands (B) in the topology
H1-H2-H3-H4-B1-B2-H5   (see   <PDB:1SMT>).   Helices  3  and  4  comprise  the
helix-turn-helix motif and the beta-sheet is called the wing as in other wHTH,
such  as  the  dtxR-type (see <PDOC50944>) or the merR-type (see <PDOC00477>).
Helix 4 is termed the recognition helix, like in other HTHs where it binds the
DNA  major  groove. Most arsR/smtB-like metalloregulators form homodimers [3].
The  dimer  interface  is  formed  by  helix 5 and an N-terminal part [4]. Two
distinct  metal-binding  sites  have been identified. The first site comprises
cysteine  thiolates  located  in  the HTH in helix 3 and for some cases in the
N-terminus,  called  the alpha3(N) site [5,1,3]. The second metal-binding site
is  located  in helix 5 (and C-terminus) and is called the alpha5(C) site. The
alpha3N site binds large thiophilic, toxic metals including Cd, Pb, and Bi, as
in  S.  aureus  cadC.  ArsR  lacks  the  N-terminal  arm  and  its alpha3 site
coordinates  smaller  thiophilic ions like As and Sb. The alpha5 site contains
carboxylate   and   imidazole   ligands   and  interacts  preferentially  with
biologically   required  metal  ions  including  Zn,  Co,  and  Ni.  ArsR-type
metalloregulators  contain  one  of  these  sites,  both,  or  other potential
metal-binding  sites  [1,2].  Binding  of  metal  ions to these sites leads to
allosteric   changes   that  can  derepress  the  operator/promoter  DNA.  The
metal-inducible operons contain one or two imperfect 12-2-12 inverted repeats,
which can be recognized by multimeric arsR-type metalloregulators.

Some proteins known to contain an arsR-type HTH domain:

 - Escherichia coli arsR, an arsenic-responsive transcription repressor of the
   arsenic  resistance  operon  (ars)  which encodes an arsenate reductase and
   metal exporters.
 - Synechococcus PCC 7942 smtB, a Zn(II)-responsive transcription repressor of
   the  smtA  gene  that  codes  for a metallothionein. SmtB senses Co(II) and
   Cd(II) too, but Zn(II) is the preferred effector.
 - Staphylococcus  aureus  cadC,  a  transcription  regulator  of  the cadmium
   resistance  (cad) operon which encodes a Cd/Pb-specific efflux ATPase. CadC
   is responsive to Cd, Pb, Bi, and Zn ions.
 - Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  nmtR,  a Ni(II)/Co(II)-responsive repressor of
   the nmtA gene that encodes an ATPase exporter.

The  signature  pattern  we  developed  starts  one  residue  upstream  of the
helix-turn-helix  motif  and  extends  six residues upstream of its C-terminal
extremity.  We  also developed a profile that covers the entire wHTH and which
allows a more sensitive detection.
