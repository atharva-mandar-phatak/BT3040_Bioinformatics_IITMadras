* PLAT domain profile *
***********************

The PLAT  domain  (after  polycystin-1,  lipoxygenase  and  alpha toxin) is an
intracellular domain of ~150 residues. The PLAT domain can be found associated
with other  domains  such  as  LRR,  PKD (see <PDOC50093>), C-type lectin (see
<PDOC00537>), GPS  (see  <PDOC50221>),  lipase, lipoxygenase (see <PDOC00077>)
prokaryotic zinc-dependent   phospholipase  C  (see  <PDOC00357>),  LCCL  (see
<PDOC50820>) or  SRCR  (see  <PDOC00348>),  It has been proposed that the PLAT
domain may be involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction [1,2].

The three-dimensional  structure  of  the  PLAT  domain  is  known for several
proteins. The domain is a beta-sandwich composed of two sheets of four strands
each (see  <PDB:1LOX>).  The  most highly conserved regions of the PLAT domain
coincide with  the  beta-strands.  Most  of  the highly conserved residues are
buried residues.  An  exception  to  this is a surface lysine or arginine that
occurs on the surface of the fifth beta-strand of all eukaryotic PLAT domains.
In pancreatic lipase, the lysine in this position forms a salt bridge with the
procolipase protein.  The  conservation  of  a  charged  surface  residue  may
indicate the  location  of  a  conserved  ligand-binding  site within the PLAT
domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain a PLAT domain are listed below:

 - Animal  polycystin-1 (PKD1). It may be an ion-channel. In human, defects in
   PKD1 are  the  cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type I
   (ADPKD) that  is  characterized by progressive formation and enlargement of
   cysts in  both  kidneys,  typically  leading  to end-stage renal disease in
   adult life. Cysts also occur in the liver and other organs.
 - Eukaryotic lipoxygenase.
 - Vertebrate lipoprotein lipase.
 - Mammalian triacylglycerol lipase.
 - Plasmodium falciparum PSLAP protein, a protein with multiple adhesive
   motifs that is expressed in gametocytes [2].
 - Plasmodium berghei multidomain scavenger receptor protein PbSR.
 - Bacterial alpha toxin.

The profile we developed covers the entire PLAT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
