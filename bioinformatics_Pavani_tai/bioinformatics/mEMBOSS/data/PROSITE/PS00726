* AP endonucleases family 1 signatures and profile *
****************************************************

Cellular  DNA  is  spontaneously and continuously damaged by environmental and
internal  factors  such  as  X-rays, UV light and agents such as the antitumor
drugs  bleomycin  and neocarzinostatin or those that generate oxygen radicals.
Apurinic/apyrimidinic  (AP)  sites  form  both  spontaneously  and  as  highly
cytotoxic  intermediates  in  the  removal  of  the  damaged  base by the base
excision  repair  (BER)  pathway.  DNA  repair at the AP sites is initiated by
specific   endonuclease   cleavage   of   the  phosphodiester  backbone.  Such
endonucleases  are also generally capable of removing blocking groups from the
3'terminus of DNA strand breaks.

AP  endonucleases can be classified into two families on the basis of sequence
similarity  and  structure  (cf.  family 2 <PDOC00599>). What we call family 1
groups the enzymes listed below [1].

 - Escherichia coli exonuclease III (gene xthA) (EC 3.1.11.2).
 - Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Bacillus subtilis exonuclease A (gene exoA)
   (EC=3.1.11.2).
 - Mammalian AP endonuclease 1 (AP1) (EC 4.2.99.18).
 - Drosophila recombination repair protein 1 (gene Rrp1) (EC=4.2.99.18).
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana   apurinic  endonuclease-redox  protein  (gene  arp)
   (EC=4.2.99.18).
 - Dictyostelium   DNA-(apurinic  or  apyrimidinic  site)  lyase  (gene  apeA)
   (EC=4.2.99.18).

Except for  Rrp1  and  arp, these enzymes are proteins of about 300 amino-acid
residues.  Rrp1 and arp both  contain  additional  and  unrelated sequences in
their N-terminal section (about 400 residues for Rrp1 and 270 for arp).

The  structures  of  bacterial exonuclease III and mammalian AP endonuclease 1
show  an alpha/beta-sandwich structure (see <PDB:1HD7; A>) with a fold similar
to  that  of DNase I (see <PDOC00711>). One or two divalent metal ions such as
magnesium or manganese can bind in the active site [2].

We  developed  three  signature  patterns  and  a  profile  for this family of
enzymes.  The  first pattern contains a glutamate which has been shown [3], in
the  Escherichia coli enzyme to bind a divalent metal ion such as magnesium or
manganese.  The  patterns are based on the most conserved regions [4]. We also
developed a profile that spans the entire AP endonucleases family 1 structure.
