********************************
* Zinc finger AN1-type profile *
********************************

This  domain  was  first  identified  as  a  putative zinc finger found in the
protein encoded by the Xenopus laevis An1 maternal mRNA [1]. The AN1-type zinc
finger  contains  six  conserved  cysteines  and  two  histidines  that  could
potentially coordinate 2 zinc atoms.

The AN1-type zinc finger is frequently found associated with domains linked to
the   ubiquitination   pathway,   such   as  the  A20-type  zinc  finger  (see
<PDOC51036>),  the  ubiquitin-like domain (see <PDOC00271>), or the UIM domain
(see <PDOC50330>). The function of the AN1-type zinc finger is not yet known.

Some proteins known to contain an AN1-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Ascidian  posterior  end  mark  6  (pem-6)  protein. Its mRNA is maternally
   expressed  and  localized  in  the  posterior-vegetal cytoplasm of ascidian
   embryo [2].
 - Human  AWP1  protein  (associated  with  PRK1). Its gene is turned on early
   during embryogenesis and ubiquitously expressed [3].
 - Human  immunoglobulin mu binding protein 2 (SMUBP-2). Mutations in the gene
   encoding  SMUBP-2  cause  spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress
   type 1 [4].

The profile we developed covers the whole AN1-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
