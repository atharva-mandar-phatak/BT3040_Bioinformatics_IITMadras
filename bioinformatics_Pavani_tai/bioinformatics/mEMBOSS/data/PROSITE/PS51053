* SERTA domain profile *
************************

The SERTA  (for  SEI-1,  RBT-1,  and  TARA)  domain is a motif of ~47 residues
corresponding to  the  largest conserved region among TRIP-Br (transcriptional
regulator interacting  with  the  PHD-bromodomain) proteins, an evolutionarily
conserved family  restricted  to higher eukaryotes. In proteins of the TRIP-Br
family, the  SERTA  domain  is  found  in  association with a cyclin A-binding
domain and  a PHD-bromo binding domain. The SERTA domain is also found in some
other proteins with no conservation with TRIP-Br proteins outside of the SERTA
motif. The   cyclin-dependent  kinase  CDK4-interacting  segment  of  TRIP-Br1
includes most of the SERTA domain [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a SERTA domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian cell division cycle associated protein 4 (CDCA4) or hematopoietic
   progenitor protein   (HEPP),   a   protein   expressed   preferentially  in
   hematopoietic progenitors and mature blood cells.
 - Human  TRIP-Br1/p34SEI-1,  a  cyclin-dependent kinase regulator interacting
   with PHD  (see <PDOC50016>) and bromodomains (see <PDOC00550>), two modules
   widely found in chromosomal proteins.
 - Mammalian  RBT1,  a  potent transcriptional coactivator that interacts with
   the second subunit of replication protein A.
 - Human Y127, an hypothetical 34-kD protein.
 - Drosophila TARANIS, a trithorax group (trxG) protein that might participate
   in a  cell  memory  process  coupling  chromatin  structure  to  cell cycle
   progression.
 - Drosophila CG2865.

The profile we developed covers the entire SERTA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
