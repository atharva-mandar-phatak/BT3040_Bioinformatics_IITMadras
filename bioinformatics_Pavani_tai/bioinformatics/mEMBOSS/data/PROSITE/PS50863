*********************************
* B3 DNA-binding domain profile *
*********************************

The  B3 domain is an about 120-amino acid residue region defined originally as
the third basic region of maize VP1, which shares the largest contiguous block
of sequence identity with its ortholog, Arabidopsis ABI3. The B3 domain, which
has  also been called REM domain, is found only in higher plant species. It is
characteristic  of several transcription factors and has been shown to possess
a highly cooperative, sequence-specific DNA-binding activity [1,2,3,4]. The B3
domain  can  be  found  in  one  or  more copies and in association with other
domains,  such  as  the  AP2  DNA-binding  domain, an  acidic  domain  or  the
Aux/IAA-ARF domain (see <PDOC50962>) [2,4].

Some proteins known to contain a B3 domain are listed below:

 - Plant REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM 1 (REM1) protein.
 - Plant ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)/VIVIPAROUS1 (VP1) family of
   regulatory protein.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana proteins related to ABI3/VP1 RAV1 and RAV2.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 1 (ARF1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana FUSCA3 (FUS3).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2).

The profile we developed covers the entire B3 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
