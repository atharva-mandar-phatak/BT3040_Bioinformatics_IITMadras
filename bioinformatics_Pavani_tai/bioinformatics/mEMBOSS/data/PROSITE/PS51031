* BESS domain profile *
***********************

The BESS domain is a ~40 amino acid module that has been named after the three
proteins that  originally  defined  the  domain:  Boundary  element associated
factor 32,  Su(var)3-7,  and  Stonewall.  The BESS domain directs a variety of
protein-protein interactions, including interactions with itself, with Dorsal,
and with  a  TBP-associated factor. It is found in a single copy in drosophila
proteins and  is  often  associated  with  the  MADF  domain (see <PDOC51029>)
[1,2,3].

It has  been  suggested  that the BESS domain might be related to the myb/SANT
HTH domain.  Consistent with the possibility of a relationship to the myb/SANT
domain, the  BESS domain secondary structure prediction suggests the existence
of three alpha-helices [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a BESS domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila  Boundary element associated factor 32 (BEAF-32).
 - Drosophila  Suppressor  of  variegation  protein 3-7 (Su(var)3-7). It could
   play a role in chromosome condensation.
 - Drosophila  Ravus.  It  is  homologous to the C-terminal part of Su(var)3-7
   [4].
 - Drosophila  Stonewall  (Stwl), a putative transcription factor required for
   maintenance of   female   germline   stem   cells   as   well   as   oocyte
   differentiation.
 - Drosophila  Adf-1,  a transcription factor first identified on the basis of
   its interaction  with the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter but that binds the
   promoters of a diverse group of genes [1].
 - Drosophila  Dorsal-interacting  protein  3  (Dip3). It functions both as an
   activator to  bind  DNA  in  a  sequence  specific manner and a coactivator
   to stimulate synergistic activation by Dorsal and Twist [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire BESS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
