* LacI-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  lacI-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  50-60  residues  present  in  the  lacI/galR  family of transcriptional
regulators  involved  in  metabolic  regulation  in prokaryotes. Most of these
bacterial  regulators  recognize sugar-inducers. The family is named after the
Escherichia  coli lactose operon repressor lacI and galactose operon repressor
galR.  LacI-type  regulators  are  present in diverse bacterial genera, in the
cytoplasm.   The  'helix-turn-helix'  DNA-binding  motif  is  located  in  the
N-terminal  extremity of these transcriptional regulators. The C-terminal part
of  lacI-type  regulators contains several regions that can be involved in (1)
binding   of   inducers,   which   are   sugars  and  their  analogs  and  (2)
oligomerization.  The  lac  repressor  is  a  tetramer, whilst the gal and cyt
repressors  are  dimers. LacI-type transcriptional regulators are important in
the coordination of catabolic, metabolic and transport operons [1,2].

Several  structures of lacI-type transcriptional regulators have been resolved
and  their  DNA-binding  domain  encompasses  a headpiece, formed by a fold of
three helices, followed by a hinge region, which can form a fourth alpha helix
or  hinge-helix  (see  <PDB:1L1M>).  The  helix-turn-helix motif comprises the
first  and  second helices, the second being called the recognition helix. The
HTH  is  involved  in DNA-binding into the major groove, while the hinge-helix
fits into the minor groove and the complete domain specifically recognizes the
operator DNA [3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a lacI-type HTH domain:

 - Bacillus subtilis  ccpA  and  ccpB,  transcriptional regulators involved in
   the catabolic repression of several operons.
 - Salmonella  typhimurium  fruR,  the  fructose  repressor,  involved  in the
   regulation of a large number of operons encoding enzymes which take part in
   central pathways of carbon metabolism.
 - Escherichia coli lacI, the lactose operon repressor, serving as a model for
   gene regulation.
 - Escherichia  coli  purF  and purR, repressors involved in the regulation of
   enzymes for purine nucleotide synthesis.
 - Haemophilus influenzae galR, a repressor of the galactose operon.

The  pattern  we  developed  spans the complete HTH motif, except for the last
residue.  We  also  developed  a  profile  that  covers  the  entire  HTH  and
DNA-binding  domain,  including  the  hinge-helix  and allows a more sensitive
detection.

 for rafR.
