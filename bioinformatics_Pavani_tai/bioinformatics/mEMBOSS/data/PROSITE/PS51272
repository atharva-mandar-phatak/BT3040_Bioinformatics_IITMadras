* S-layer homology (SLH) domain profile *
*****************************************

S-layers  are paracrystalline mono-layered assemblies of (glyco)proteins which
coat  the  surface  of bacteria [1,2]. Several S-layer proteins and some other
cell  wall  proteins  contain  one  or  more copies of a domain of about 50-60
residues,  which  has  been called SLH (for S-layer homology). Although it was
originally  proposed that SLH domains bind to peptidoglycan, it is now evident
that  pyruvylated  secondary  cell  wall  polymers  (SCWPs),  which are either
teichoic acids, teichuronic acids, lipoteichoic acids or lipoglycans, serve as
the  anchoring structures for SLH motifs in the Gram-positive cell wall [2,4].
However,  the  study  of  S-layer protein SbpA of Bacillus sphaericus revealed
that  SLH  motifs  are not sufficient for specific binding to SCWPs. Thus, the
molecular  basis  explaining  SLH affinity and specificity of interaction with
cell wall polymers are not completely elucidated [5].

Some proteins known to contain SLH motif(s) are listed below:

 - Bacillus anthracis sterne S-layer protein Sap (3 copies).
 - Bacillus anthracis sterne 9131 S-layer protein EA1 (3 copies).
 - Bacillus licheniformis strain NM 105 S-layer protein NM 105 (3 copies).
 - Bacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2 S-layer protein SbsB (3 copies).
 - Bacillus sphaericus CCM 2177 S-layer protein SbpA (3 copies).
 - Brevibacillus choshinensis strain HPD31 S-layer protein (HWP) (2 copies).
 - Brevibacillus brevis strain 47 middle cell wall protein (MWP) (2 copies).
 - Clostridium thermocellum NCIB 10682 S-layer protein SlpA (2 copies).
 - Thermoanaerobacter kivui DSM 2030 S-layer glycoprotein (2 copies).
 - Thermus thermophilus strain HB8 S-layer protein P100 (1 copy).
 - Bacillus circulans Keratanase (3 copies).
 - Bacillus sp. strain KSM-635 endoglucanase (3 copies).
 - Bacillus sp. strain XAL601 amylopullulanase AapT (3 copies).
 - Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum endoxylanase XynA (2 copies).
 - Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain JW/SL-YS 485 endoxylanase XynA (3 copies).

   copies).
 - Thermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenes endoxylanase XynA (3 copies).
 - Thermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenes polygalacturonase PglA (3 copies).
 - Cellulomonas fimi mannanase Man26A (3 copies).
 - Acetivibrio cellulolyticus cellulosomal scaffoldin protein ScaC (3 copies).
 - Clostridium josui endoglucanase (gene celA) (3 copies).
 - Clostridium thermocellum  cellulosomal  scaffoldin dockerin binding protein
   SdbA (3 copies).
 - Clostridium thermocellum cell surface glycoprotein OlpB (3 copies).

 - Thermotoga maritima outer membrane protein Omp alpha (1 copy).
