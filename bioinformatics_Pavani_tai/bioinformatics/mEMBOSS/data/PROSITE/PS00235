* Gas vesicles protein GVPc repeated domain signature *
*******************************************************

Gas vesicles are small, hollow, gas filled protein structures found in several
cyanobacterial  and archaebacterial     microorganisms  [1].  They  allow  the
positioning of  the  bacteria  at the favorable depth for growth. Gas vesicles
are hollow    cylindrical tubes, closed by a hollow, conical cap  at each end.
Both the    conical  end caps and central cylinder are made  up of 4-5 nm wide
ribs that  run at right angles to the long axis of the structure. Gas vesicles
seem to be constituted of two different protein components: GVPa and GVPc.

GVPc is  a  minor  constituent  of gas vesicles and seems to be located on the
outer surface.    Structurally,  cyanobacterial GVPc  consists of four or five
tandem repeats  of  a 33  residue  sequence  flanked by sequences of 18 and 10
residues at the N- and C-termini, respectively.

We derived a  signature pattern for the repeated domain.  This signature spans
positions 11 to 33 of that domain.

-Consensus pattern: F-L-x(2)-T-x(3)-R-x(3)-A-x(2)-Q-x(3)-L-x(2)-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This pattern is not  designed to  detect archaebacterial GVPc [2] which
 is composed of 8  tandem  repeats of  a sequence  very  distantly (if at all)
 related to that of cyanobacterial GVPc.
