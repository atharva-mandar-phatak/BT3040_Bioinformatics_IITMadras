* Biotinyl/lipoyl domain profile *
**********************************

Biotin  and lipoic acid moieties are the covalently bound cofactors of several
multicomponent  enzyme  complexes  that catalyze key metabolic reactions. They
are  attached to a lysine residue, via an amide bond, by specific biotinyl and
lipoyl  protein  ligases. The lipoyl-lysine and biotinyl-lysine residues serve
as  swinging  arms, ferrying substrate between the three active sites in their
relevant   enzyme   complexes   [1].   The   80   residues   surrounding   the
biotinyl-binding  lysine  residue  (see  <PDOC00167>)  display  some  sequence
similarity   to   that   around   the   lipoyl-binding   lysine  residue  (see
<PDOC00168>).

The  lipoyl  domains of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes and the
biotinyl  domains  of biotin-dependent enzymes have been solved [2,3] (see for
example  <PDB:1PMR>).  They have homologous structures (a flattened 8-stranded
-barrel)   with   their   target  lysine  residues  positioned  in  comparable
beta-turns.   Several   residues  important  for  the  specificity  have  been
identified,  most  notably the conserved methionine flanking the target lysine
is  essential  for  the  recognition  of  the  biotinyl domain by the biotinyl
protein ligase [4].

Enzymes that contain a biotinyl domain are listed below:

 - Pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1).
 - Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2).
 - Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.3).
 - Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.4).
 - Geranoyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.5).
 - Urea carboxylase (EC 6.3.4.6).
 - Oxaloacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.3).
 - Methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.41).
 - Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.70).
 - Methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyl-transferase (EC 2.1.3.1) (transcarboxylase).

Enzymes that contain a lipoyl domain are listed below:

 - Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
 - 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC).
 - Branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC).

The profile we developed covers the whole biotinyl/lipoyl domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
