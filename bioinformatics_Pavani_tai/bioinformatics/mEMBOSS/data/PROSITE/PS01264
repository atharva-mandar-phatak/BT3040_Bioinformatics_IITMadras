* T-box domain signatures and profile *
***************************************

A number  of  eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins contain a domain of about 170 to
190 amino acids known as the T-box domain [1,2,3] and which probably binds DNA.
The T-box  has  first  been  found  in the mice T locus (Brachyury) protein, a
transcription factor involved in mesoderm differentiation. It  has  since been
found in the following proteins:

 - Vertebrate and invertebrate homologs of the T protein.
 - Mammalian proteins TBX1 to TBX20.
 - Mammalian protein TBR1 which is expressed specifically in brain.
 - Mammalian and Xenopus laevis eomesodermin (eomes or TBR2).
 - Xenopus laevis Vegt (or Antipodean), a transcription factor that activates
   the expression of wnt-8, eomes and Brachyury.
 - Chicken TbxT.
 - Drosophila protein optomotor-blind (omb).
 - Drosophila  protein  brachyenteron  (byn)  (also  known  as  Trg), which is
   required for the specification of the hindgut and anal pads.
 - Drosophila protein H15.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans proteins tbx-1 to tbx-40.

As signature patterns for the T-domain, we selected two conserved regions. The
first region corresponds to the N-terminal of the domain and the second one to
the central part. A profile that spans the complete domain was also developed.

-Consensus pattern: [LQI]-W-x(2)-[FCL]-x(3,4)-[NT]-E-[MQ]-[LIVNM]-[LIV]-[TLF]-
                    x(2)-[GR]-[RG]-[KRQM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for C.elegans tbx-35.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYWE]-H-[PADHL]-[DENQRS]-[GSE]-x(3)-G-x(2)-[WL]-[ML]-
                    x(3)-[IVA]-x-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for C.elegans tbx-12, ZK177.10 and Drosophila H15.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
