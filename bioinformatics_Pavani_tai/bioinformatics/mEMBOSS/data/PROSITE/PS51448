* P-type ('Trefoil') domain signature and profile *
***************************************************

A cysteine-rich  domain of  approximately forty five   amino-acid residues has
been found  in some extracellular eukaryotic proteins [1,2,3,4,5]. This domain
is known  as  either  the  'P',  'trefoil'  or  'TFF'  domain. It contains six
cysteines that  are  linked  by  three  disulfide bonds in a 1-5, 2-4, and 3-6
configuration. This   leads   to   a  characteristic  three  leafed  structure
('trefoil'). The  P-type domain is clearly composed of three looplike regions.
The central  core  of the domain consists of a short two-stranded antiparallel
beta-sheet, which  is  capped by an irregular loop and forms a central hairpin
(loop 3).  The beta-sheet is preceded by a short alpha-helix, with majority of
the remainder  of  the domain contained in two loops, which lie on either side
of the central hairpin (see <PDB:1E9T>) [6].

Proteins known to contain this domain are:

 - Protein pS2 (TFF1), a protein secreted by the stomach mucosa, whose gene is
   induced by  estrogen.  The  exact  function  of  pS2  is not known. It is a
   protein of about 65 residues and it contains a copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Spasmolytic  polypeptide  (SP) (TFF2), a protein of about 115 residues that
   inhibits gastrointestinal motility  and gastric acid secretion. SP could be
   a growth factor. It contains two tandem copies of the 'P' domain.
 - Intestinal  trefoil  factor (ITF) (TFF3), an intestinal protein of about 60
   residues which  may  have a role in promoting cell migration. It contains a
   copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Xenopus stomach proteins xP1 (one 'P' domain) and xP4 (four 'P' domains).
 - Xenopus  integumentary  mucins  A.1  (FIM-A.1 or preprospasmolysin) and C.1
   (FIM-C.1). These  proteins  could  be involved in defense against microbial
   infections by  protecting the epithelia from external environment. They are
   large proteins  (400 residues for A.1; more than 660 residues for C.1 whose
   sequence is  only partially known) that contain multiple copies  of the 'P'
   domain interspersed  with  tandem repeats of threonine-rich, O-glycosylated
   regions.
 - Xenopus  skin protein xp2 (or APEG) a protein that contains two 'P' domains
   and which  exists  in  two  alternative  spliced forms that differ from the
   inclusion of a N-terminal region of 320 residues that  consist of 33 tandem
   repeats of a G-[GE]-[AP](2,4)-A-E motif.
 - Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B) (also known as ZP-X in rabbit
   and ZP-3  alpha in pig). This protein is a receptor-like glycoprotein whose
   extracellular region  contains  a  'P'  domain followed by a ZP domain (see
   <PDOC00577>).
 - Intestinal  sucrase-isomaltase    (EC 3.2.1.48 / EC 3.2.1.10), a vertebrate
   membrane-bound, multifunctional  enzyme  complex  which hydrolyzes sucrose,
   maltose and isomaltose (see <PDOC00120>).
 - Lysosomal  alpha-glucosidase    (EC  3.2.1.20) (acid maltase), a vertebrate
   extracellular glycosidase (see <PDOC00120>).

Structurally the P-type domain can be represented as shown below.
