* La-type HTH domain profile *
******************************

The  La-type  HTH  domain  is  an  RNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about  90  residues  present  in  La proteins and other eukaryotic
RNA-binding  proteins.  The domain is named after human La protein, originally
characterized  as  an  autoantigen  of  the  rheumatic diseases systemic lupus
erythematosus  and Sjogren's syndrome (La derives from the patient's name). La
homologs  have  been found in all eukaryots including plants, trypanosomes and
yeast.  The  La  protein  is  a  nuclear phosphoprotein that recognizes the 3'
uridylates  (3'  UUU[OH])  present in all newly synthesized RNA polymerase III
transcripts. La binding stabilizes these transcripts from exonucleases and may
assist  their folding. The La-type HTH domain occurs in the N-terminal part of
La  proteins,  followed  by  one  or  two  RNA  recognition  motifs (RRM) (see
<PDOC00030>).   The   La-type   HTH   also   occurs   in  combination  with  a
double-stranded RNA binding motif and with a SAM binding motif.

The  crystal  structure  of  the  N-terminal  domain  of  the  La protein from
Trypanosoma  brucei  shows  that  the  domain  forms  a  wHTH  containing  six
alpha-helices  (H) and a three-stranded (B) antiparallel sheet with a topology
H1-H1'-H2-B1-H3-H4-H5-B2-B3  (see  <PDB:1S29>).  The  wHTH  fold  is  found in
eukaryotic   and   prokaryotic   transcription   factors,   wherein  the  wHTH
specifically  binds  to  dsDNA  (e.g.  see  <PDOC00042>).  Two  of  the  three
N-terminal  helices and helix 4 may be considered as insertions into such wHTH
topologies.  The  helices 3 and 5 correspond with the HTH and the strands form
the  wing  in  such  transcription factors, where these structures bind DNA. A
different  surface,  which  is  formed  by  a conserved aromatic patch between
helices H1, H1', H2 and the loop between H3 and H4 may bind RNA in the La-type
HTH domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain a La-type HTH domain:

 - Eukaryotic  La  protein,  a  nuclear  protein  that binds the 3' termini of
   nascent   RNA   polymerase  III  transcripts  and  other  small  RNA,  like
   pre-tRNA's,  5S  rRNA's,  U6  RNA  and SRP RNA, as characterized in humans,
   fruit  fly,  baker's  and  fission  yeast, and Trypanosoma brucei. Both the
   La-type  HTH  domain  and  the  RRM are required for RNA binding by La. The
   aromatic  patch of the La-type wHTH is required for specific binding to the
   3'UUU[OH] of pre-tRNA [1,2].
 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae SRO9 and SLF1, which associate with polyribosomes
   and may function in translation.
 - Euplotes   aediculatus   p43,  a  component  of  the  ciliate's  telomerase
   ribonucleoprotein. P43 does not bind to the 3' UUU[OH].

The profile we developed covers the entire La-type HTH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The La-type HTH domain has also been named LM for 'La motif' [1].
