* Norovirus 3C-like protease (NV 3CLpro) domain profile *
*********************************************************

Noroviruses (NVs;  formerly  "Norwalk-like viruses") [E1], which belong to the
Caliciviridae, are   the   major   causative   agents  of  nonbacterial  acute
gastroenteritis in  humans.  The  NV genome, which consists of positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA,  contains three open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF
produces a  polyprotein  that  is processed by the viral 3C-like protease into
six nonstructural  proteins.  The  six  NV  ORF1  nonstructural  proteins  are
homologous to  picornaviral  nonstructural proteins and are named accordingly:
N-terminal protein, 2C-like nucleoside triphosphatase, 3A-like protein, 3B VPg
(genome-linked viral  protein,  3C-like  protease  (NV  3CLpro), and a 3D RNA-
dependent RNA  polymerase. NV 3CLpros are the key enzymes for ORF1 polyprotein
processing and  also  cleave  the  poly(A)-binding  protein,  causing cellular
translation inhibition.  NV  3CLpros  belong to the chymotrypsin-like protease
family, in  that  they  appear  to  have  chymotrypsin-like folds. Whether the
3CLpro domain  has  a  catalytic dyad of composed of histidine and cysteine or
tryad of histidine, glutamate and cysteine remains controversial [1,2]. The NV
3CLpro domain forms peptidase family C37 [E2].

The NV  3CLpro  domain adopts a serine protease-like fold that consists of two
beta-barrels separated  by  a cleft within which lie the active site catalytic
residues (see  <PDB:1WQS>).  The  N-terminal beta barrel has two alpha-helices
and seven  beta-strands.  The  beta-strands  form a twisted antiparallel beta-
sheet ressembling  an incomplete beta-barrel. The core of the incomplete beta-
barrel contains  hydrophobic  residues.  The  active site histidine residue is
found in  the N-terminal beta-barrel, as well as the glutamate. The C-terminal
six-stranded antiparallel  beta-barrel  contains the active site cysteine. The
catalytic site  formed  is  situated deep within a cleft between the N- and C-
terminal beta-barrels [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire NV 3CLpro domain.
