* Profilin signature *
**********************

Profilin [1,2] is a small  eukaryotic  protein that  binds  to monomeric actin
(G-actin) in a 1:1 ratio  thus  preventing  the  polymerization  of actin into
filaments (F-actin).  It  can  also,  in  certain  circumstance promotes actin
polymerization. Profilin also binds to polyphosphoinositides such as PIP2.

Overall sequence  similarity  among  profilin from  organisms  which belong to
different phyla (ranging  from fungi to mammals) is low,  but  the  N-terminal
region is relatively well  conserved. That region is thought to be involved in
the binding to actin. The signature pattern for profilin is based on conserved
residues at the N-terminal extremity.

A protein structurally similar to profilin is present in the genome of variola
and vaccinia viruses (gene A42R).

-Consensus pattern: <x(0,1)-[STA]-x(0,1)-W-[DENQH]-x-[YI]-x-[DEQ]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for a wheat profilin.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
-Last update: November 1995 / Text revised.
