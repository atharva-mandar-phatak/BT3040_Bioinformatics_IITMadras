* Ribosomal protein S13 signature and profile *
***********************************************

Ribosomal protein S13 is one of the proteins from the small ribosomal subunit.
In Escherichia  coli,  S13  is  known to be involved in binding fMet-tRNA and,
hence, in  the  initiation of translation. It is a basic protein of 115 to 177
amino-acid residues [1,2].

The  crystal structure of the S13 protein has been solved as part of the small
ribosomal  subunit  (see  <PDB:1J5E; M>)  [3].  It  consists  of two separated
domains,  an  approximately  60-residue  N-terminal domain which forms a small
helical  domain  consisting  of two-turn helices and two alpha-turn structure,
and  a  C-terminal  long  straight  alpha helix followed by a region devoid of
secondary  structure.  The  N-terminal  domain  makes  several  base  specific
interactions with the 16S RNA. Several lysine residues in the C-terminal helix
also contact RNA.

Proteins known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Eubacterial S13.
 - Plant chloroplast S13 (nuclear encoded).
 - Red algal chloroplast S13.
 - Cyanelle S13.
 - Archaebacterial S13.
 - Plant mitochondrial S13.
 - Mammalian and plant S18.

As  a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved regions located at the
C-terminal  end  of the long straight alpha helix. We also developed a profile
which covers the N-terminal domain and the long straight alpha helix.

-Consensus pattern: [KRQSEAT]-[GS]-x-R-H-x(2)-[GSNHKLCD]-x(2)-[LIVMCT]-[RNH]-
                    G-Q
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Chlamydia trachomatis S13.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
