* Aminotransferases class-V pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site *
*****************************************************************

Aminotransferases  share certain mechanistic features with   other  pyridoxal-
phosphate dependent enzymes, such as  the  covalent  binding of the pyridoxal-
phosphate group  to  a  lysine  residue.  On the basis of sequence similarity,
these various  enzymes  can  be  grouped [1,2] into subfamilies. One of these,
called class-V, currently consists of the following enzymes:

 - Phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52), an enzyme which catalyzes the
   reversible interconversion   of   phosphoserine   and   2-oxoglutarate   to
   3-phosphonooxypyruvate and  glutamate.  It  is  required  both in the major
   phosphorylated pathway   of   serine   biosynthesis   and   in   pyridoxine
   biosynthesis. The  bacterial  enzyme  (gene  serC)  is  highly similar to a
   rabbit endometrial progesterone-induced protein (EPIP), which is probably a
   phosphoserine aminotransferase [3].
 - Serine--glyoxylate  aminotransferase  (EC 2.6.1.45) (SGAT) (gene sgaA) from
   Methylobacterium extorquens.
 - Serine--pyruvate  aminotransferase  (EC 2.6.1.51). This enzyme also acts as
   an alanine--glyoxylate  aminotransferase  (EC 2.6.1.44). In vertebrates, it
   is located in the peroxisomes and/or mitochondria.
 - Isopenicillin  N  epimerase  (gene  cefD).  This  enzyme is involved in the
   biosynthesis of  cephalosporin  antibiotics  and  catalyzes  the reversible
   isomerization of isopenicillin N and penicillin N.
 - NifS, a protein  of  the  nitrogen  fixation  operon  of  some bacteria and
   cyanobacteria. The  exact  function  of  nifS  is  not  yet known. A highly
   similar protein has been found in fungi (gene NFS1 or SPL1).
 - The small subunit of cyanobacterial soluble hydrogenase (EC 1.12.-.-).
 - Hypothetical protein ycbU from Bacillus subtilis.
 - Hypothetical protein YFL030w from yeast.

The sequence around the pyridoxal-phosphate  attachment site  of this class of
enzyme is sufficiently conserved to allow the creation of a specific pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVFYCHT]-[DGH]-[LIVMFYAC]-[LIVMFYA]-x(2)-[GSTAC]-[GSTA]-
                    [HQR]-K-x(4,6)-G-x-[GSAT]-x-[LIVMFYSAC]
                    [K is the pyridoxal-P attachment site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: Almost all.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.
