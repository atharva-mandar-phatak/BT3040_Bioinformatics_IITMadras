* PWI domain profile *
**********************

The PWI  domain, named after a highly conserved PWI tri-peptide located within
its N-terminal  region,  is  a ~80 amino acid module, which is found either at
the N-terminus  or  at  the C-terminus of eukaryotic proteins involved in pre-
mRNA processing [1]. It is found in association with other domains such as RRM
(see <PDOC00030>)  and RS. The PWI domain is a RNA/DNA-binding domain that has
an equal  preference  for  single-  and  double-stranded  nucleic acids and is
likely to have multiple important functions in pre-mRNA processing [2].

The PWI  domain  is  a soluble, globular and independently folded domain which
consists of  a  four-helix  bundle, with structured N- and C-terminal elements
(see <PDB:1MP1>) [2].

Some proteins known to contain a PWI domain are listed below:

 - Metazoan proteins homologous to SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kD
   (SRm160).
 - Mammalian splicing factor PRP3.

The profile we developed covers the entire PWI domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: February 2007 / First entry.
