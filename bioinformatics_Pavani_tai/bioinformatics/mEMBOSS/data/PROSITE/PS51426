* ABL domain profile *
**********************

The Rcs  signaling  pathway controls a variety of physiological functions like
capsule synthesis,   cell   division  or  motility  in  prokaryotes.  The  Rcs
regulatory pathway  is  a  complex modification of the standard bacterial two-
component signaling  systems.  The  Rcs regulatory cascade, involving a multi-
step phosphorelay  between  the  two membrane bound hybrid sensor kinases RcsC
and RcsD  and  the  global  regulator  RcsB,  is,  up  to now, one of the most
complicated regulatory  systems  in bacteria. This signal transfer is mediated
by a   RcsC/RcsD/RcsB  phosphorelay  cascade  involving  conserved  integrated
phosphate shuttle domains [1].

The ABL  (Alpha/Beta/Loop) domain is found between the histidine kinase domain
(see <PDOC50109>)  and the response regulatory domain (see <PDOC50110>) of all
RcsC sequences  of all enterobacteria sequenced so far. The central element of
the ABL  domain  structure  is  a  five-stranded  parallel  beta-sheet. Packed
against one  side  of  this  sheet  are  two alpha helices while the remaining
connection between the individual beta-strands is provided by three loops, all
located on  the  opposite  side  of  the beta-sheet (see <PDB:2AYY>). It shows
a structural  similarity  to  the  response  regulatory  domain and contains a
conserved aspartate  residue in a location that corresponds to the active site
in the  response  regulatory domain. However the ABL domain does not appear to
play a direct role in the phosphoryl transfer [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire ABL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
