* Stathmin family signatures *
******************************

Stathmin [1] (from the Greek 'stathmos' which means relay),  is an  ubiquitous
intracellular protein, present in a variety  of phosphorylated forms and which
is involved  in  the  regulation  of  the  microtubule (MT) filament system by
destabilizing microtubules.  It  prevents assembly and promotes disassembly of
microtubules.

Stathmin  is  a  highly   conserved  protein  of  149  amino  acid   residues.
Structurally, it  consists  of  an  N-terminal  domain  of  about  45 residues
followed by  a  78  residue alpha-helical domain consisting of a heptad repeat
coiled coil structure and a C-terminal domain of 25 residues.

Stathmin belongs to a family that also includes:

 - Stathmin 2 (Protein SCG10); a  neuron-specific, membrane-associated protein
   that accumulates  in  the  growth cones of developing neurons. It is highly
   similar in  its  sequence  to  stathmin, but differs in that it contains an
   additional N-terminal hydrophobic segment of 32 residues  which is probably
   responsible for its interaction with membranes.
 - Stathmin 3  (SCG10-like  protein;  SCLIP)  [2];  a   protein   specifically
   expressed in neurons.
 - Stathmin  4  (Stathmin-like  protein  B3);  which contains an additional N-
   terminal hydrophobic domain [3].

As signatures  for  proteins  of  the stathmin family, we selected a conserved
decapeptide which  ends  with  the  first  three  residues  of the coiled coil
domain and  a second pattern that corresponds to part of the central region of
the coiled coil.
