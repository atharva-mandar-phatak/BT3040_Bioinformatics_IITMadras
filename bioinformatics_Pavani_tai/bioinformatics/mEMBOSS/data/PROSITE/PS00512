* Alpha-galactosidase signature *
*********************************

Alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) (melibiase) [1]  catalyzes the hydrolysis of
melibiose into galactose and glucose. In man, the deficiency of this enzyme is
the cause of Fabry's disease (X-linked sphingolipidosis).  Alpha-galactosidase
is present  in a  variety of organisms.  There  is  a  considerable  degree of
similarity in  the  sequence of  alpha-galactosidase  from  various eukaryotic
species.

Escherichia coli alpha-galactosidase  (gene melA),   which  requires  NAD  and
magnesium as cofactors, is not structurally related to the eukaryotic enzymes;
by contrast, an  Escherichia coli  plasmid  encoded  alpha-galactosidase (gene
rafA) [2] contains  a  region  of  about  50 amino acids which is similar to a
domain of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases.

Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49) [3] catalyzes the hydrolysis  of
terminal non-reducing  N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues in  N-acetyl-alpha-D-
galactosaminides.  In man,  the deficiency  of  this enzyme  is  the cause  of
Schindler and Kanzaki diseases. The sequence  of this enzyme is highly related
to that of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases.

We selected, as a  signature pattern for these enzymes, the N-terminal part of
the conserved  domain.  The  pattern  contains  two  conserved  aspartic  acid
residues which could be involved in the catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: G-[LIVMFY]-x(2)-[LIVMFY]-x-[LIVM]-D-[DF]-x(1,2)-W-x(3,7)-
                    [RV]-[DNSF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belong  to families 27 and 36 in the classification of
 glycosyl hydrolases [4,E1].
