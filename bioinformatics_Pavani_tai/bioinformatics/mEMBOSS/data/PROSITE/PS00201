* Flavodoxin signature *
************************

Flavodoxins [1,E1] are  electron-transfer  proteins  that function in  various
electron transport systems. Flavodoxins bind one FMN molecule, which serves as
a redox-active prosthetic group.  Flavodoxins are functionally interchangeable
with ferredoxins. They have been isolated from prokaryotes, cyanobacteria, and
some eukaryotic algae.     The signature pattern for these proteins is derived
from a conserved  region in  their N-terminal section, this region is involved
in the binding of the FMN phosphate group.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[LIVFY]-[FY]-x-[ST]-{V}-x-[AGC]-x-T-{P}-x(2)-A-{L}-

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 6.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
