*********************************
* SLC26A transporters signature *
*********************************

A number  of  proteins, the majority of which are involved in the transport of
anions across  a  membrane  as  well as some yet uncharacterized proteins have
been shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These proteins are:

 - Mammalian sulfate anion transporter 1 (SAT-1) (gene SLC26A1).
 - Mammalian  DTDST  (gene SLC26A2), a sulfate transporter which, in Human, is
   involved in the genetic disease, diastrophic dysplasia (DTD).
 - Mammalian chloride anion exchanger (DRA) (gene SLC26A3).
 - Mammalian pendrin (PDS) (gene SLC26A4), a chloride/iodide transporter which
   in Human is involved in a number of hearing loss genetic diseases.
 - Mammalian  prestin  (gene  SLC26A5), a motor protein that converts auditory
   stimuli to   length   changes  in  outer  hair  cells  and  mediates  sound
   amplification in  the mammalian hearing organ. Prestin is, so far, the only
   member of  this family whose direct function is not to transport ion across
   a membrane.
 - Mammalian SLC26A6, whose function is not yet known.

 - Neurospora crassa sulfate permease II (gene cys-14).
 - Yeast sulfate permeases (genes SUL1 and SUL2).
 - Sulfate transporters 1, 2 and 3 from the legume Stylosanthes hamata.
 - Soybean early nodulin 70.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ychM.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F41D9.5.

As expected by their transport function, these proteins are highly hydrophobic
and seem to contain about 12 transmembrane domains.  The best conserved region
seems to  be  located  in  the  second  transmembrane  region and is used as a
signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [PAV]-x-[FYLCVI]-[GS]-L-Y-[STAG]-[STAGL]-x(4)-[LIVFYA]-
                    [LIVMST]-[YI]-x(3)-[GA]-[GST]-[SRV]-[KRNP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
