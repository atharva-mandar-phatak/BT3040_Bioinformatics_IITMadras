* Integrase DNA binding domain profile *
****************************************

The  retroviral integrase is the enzyme responsible for the insertion of a DNA
copy  of  the viral genome into host DNA, an essential step in the replication
cycle  of  viruses  [1].  Integrases  comprise three functional and structural
domains:  the  central core domain, which contains the catalytic residues (see
<PDOC50994>), an N-terminal zinc finger (see <PDOC50876>) and a C-terminal DNA
binding  domain  [2].  The  DNA  binding  domain displays the same DNA binding
characteristic  and  affinity for viral and nonspecific double-stranded DNA as
the intact integrase protein [3].

The structure of the DNA binding domain of HIV-1 integrase has been determined
(see  <PDB:1IHV>).  The  domain  dimerizes  in  solution,  and each subunit is
composed  of  a five-stranded beta-barrel with a topology very similar to that
of  the  SH3  domain.  Dimerization form a large central saddle-shaped groove.
This  cleft  contains  a  number  of  positively  charged  residues,  and  its
dimensions are appropriate for accommodating a double-stranded DNA helix [4].

The profile we developed covers the whole integrase DNA binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
