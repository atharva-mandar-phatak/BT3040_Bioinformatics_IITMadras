* Zinc finger matrin-type profile *
***********************************

This C2H2  zinc finger was first identified in the protein Matrin 3 [1]. It is
also found  in several spliceosome RNA-binding proteins, suggesting a possible
role in pre-mRNA binding.

The matrin zinc finger follows the general pattern C-x2-C-x(12,16)-H-x5-H. The
spacings  are different from the 'classical' DNA-binding C2H2 zinc finger (see
<PDOC00028>),  nevertheless  these  two  domains are too closely related to be
fully separated by a pattern.

Some of the proteins containing this domain are listed below:

 - Matrin  3.  May  interact  with  other  nuclear matrix proteins to form the
   internal fibrogranular network.
 - Eukaryotic  splicing factor 3A subunits 2 (SAP62/PRP11) and 3 (SAP60/PRP9).
   These are  subunits  of  the SF3A complex required for 'A' complex assembly
   formed by  the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence (BPS)
   in pre-mRNA. May anchor U2 snRNP to pre-mRNA.
 - U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C. Directly bind pre-mRNA [2].
 - Mammalian nuclear protein NP220. Related to matrin 3.
 - Formin binding protein 21, a spliceosome-associated protein.

We have developed a profile that covers the whole zinc finger with 2 positions
upstream,  usually  aromatic,  and  5  positions downstream which could form a
positively charge tail important for RNA binding activity.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 yeast PRP11.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / First entry.
