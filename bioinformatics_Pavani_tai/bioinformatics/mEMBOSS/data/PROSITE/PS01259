* Apoptosis regulator proteins, Bcl-2 family BH motifs signatures/profiles *
****************************************************************************

Active cell  suicide  (apoptosis)  is  induced by events such as growth factor
withdrawal and  toxins.  It  is controlled by regulators, which have either an
inhibitory effect    on    programmed cell death (anti-apoptotic) or block the
protective effect of inhibitors (pro-apoptotic) [1,2]. Many viruses have found
a way of countering defensive  apoptosis  by encoding their own anti-apoptosis
genes preventing their target-cells from dying too soon.

All proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family [3] contain either a BH1, BH2, BH3,
or BH4  motif. All anti-apoptotic proteins contain BH1 and BH2 motifs; some of
them contain  an  additional  N-terminal  BH4  motif (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-w),
which is  never  seen  in  pro-apoptotic proteins, except for Bcl-x(S). On the
other hand,  all  pro-apoptotic  proteins contain a BH3 motif (except for Bad)
necessary for dimerization with other proteins of Bcl-2 family and crucial for
their killing  activity;  some  of  them also contain BH1 and BH2 motifs (Bax,
Bak). The  BH3  motif  is also present in some anti-apoptotic protein, such as
Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L).

Some proteins that are known to contain these motifs are listed below.

 - Vertebrate protein  Bcl-2. Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis; it prolongs the survival
   of hematopoietic  cells  in the absence of required growth factors and also
   in the presence of various stimuli inducing cellular death. Two isoforms of
   bcl-2 (alpha  and  beta)  are generated by alternative  splicing.  Bcl-2 is
   expressed in  a  wide range of tissues at various times during development.
   It forms heterodimers with the Bax proteins.
 - Vertebrate protein Bcl-x. Two isoforms of Bcl-x (Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-x(S)) are
   generated by  alternative splicing. While the longer product (Bcl-x(L)) can
   protect a  growth-factor-dependent  cell  line  from apoptosis, the shorter
   form blocks  the  protective  effect  of  Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) and acts as an
   anti-anti-apoptosis protein.
 - Mammalian  protein  Bax. Bax block the anti-apoptosis ability of Bcl-2 with
   which it forms heterodimers. There is no evidence that Bax has any activity
   in the absence of Bcl-2. Three isoforms of bax (alpha, beta and gamma)  are
   generated by alternative splicing.
 - Mammalian  protein  Bak,  which  promotes  cell  death  and counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Mammalian protein Bcl-w, which promotes cell survival.
 - Mammalian  protein  bad,  which  promotes  cell  death, and counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-x(L), but not that of Bcl-2.
 - Human  protein  Bik,  which promotes cell death, but cannot counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Mouse  protein  Bid,  which induces caspases and apoptosis, and counteracts
   the protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Xenopus laevis protein Xr1, which could be the homolog of mammalian Bcl-w.
 - Xenopus laevis protein Xr11, which promotes cell survival.
 - Human  induced  myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL1. MCL1 is
   probably involved   in   programming  of  differentiation  and  concomitant
   maintenance of  viability  but  not proliferation. Its expression increases
   early during  phorbolester induced differentiation in myeloid leukemia cell
   line ML-1.
 - Mouse hemopoietic-specific early response protein A1.
 - African swine fever virus protein LMW5-HL, a bcl-2  homolog expressed early
   and late  in  the infection cycle. It also shows similarity to the Epstein-
   Barr-Virus (EBV)  BHRF1, which is distantly related to the Bcl-2 family and
   is therefore not discussed in this entry.
 - Caenorhabditis protein ced-9 [2].
 - Mammalian activator of apoptosis Harakiri [4] (also known as neuronal death
   protein Dp5).  This  is  a  small  protein  of  92  residues that activates
   apoptosis. It contains a BH3 motif, but no BH1, BH2 or BH4 motifs.

We  have  developed  patterns for  the four BH motifs. There is also a profile
for the  BH4 motif as well as one profile for the bcl-2 family that spans part
of BH3, BH1 and BH2 motifs.
