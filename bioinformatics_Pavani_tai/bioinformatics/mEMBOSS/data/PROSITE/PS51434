* NUP C-terminal domain profile *
*********************************

Communication between  the  nucleus  and  cytoplams  of  an eukaryotic cell is
mediated by  the  nuclear  pore  complexes  (NPCs),  which  act  as  selective
molecular gateways.  Through  these  gateways,  RNAs and proteins are exported
into the   nucleus.   Each  NPC  consists  of  ~30  distinct  proteins  termed
nucleoporins, each  present in at least eight copies, reflecting the octagonal
symmetry of  the  complex. The following nucleoporins share an ~150-residue C-
terminal domain responsible for NPC targeting [1,2]:

 - Vertebrate  Nup98,  a  component of the nuclear pore that plays its primary
   role in the export of RNAs.
 - Yeast  Nup100, plays an important role in several nuclear export and import
   pathways including poly(A)+ RNA and protein transport.
 - Yeast Nup116, which is involved in mRNA export and protein transport.
 - Yeast Nup145, involved in nuclear poly(A)+ RNA and tRNA export.

The NUP   C-terminal  domains  of  Nup98  and  Nup145  possess  peptidase  S59
autoproteolytic activity  [E1].  The autoproteolytic sites of Nup98 and Nup145
each occur immediately C-terminal to the NUP C-terminal domain. Thus, although
this domain occurs in the middle of each precursor polypeptide, it winds up at
the C-terminal end of the N-terminal cleavage product. Cleavage of the peptide
chains are necessary for the proper targeting to the nuclear pore [1,2].

The NUP  C-terminal  domain  adopts a predominantly beta-strand structure (see
<PDB:2AIV>). The  molecule  consists  of  a six-stranded beta-sheet sandwiched
against a two-stranded beta-sheet and flanked by alpha-helical regions. The N-
terminal helical  region consists of two short helices, whereas the stretch on
the opposite side of molecule consists of a single, longer helix [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire NUP C-terminal domain.
