* Ubiquitin domain signature and profile *
******************************************

Ubiquitin [1,2,3] is a protein  of  seventy  six amino acid residues, found in
all eukaryotic  cells  and  whose  sequence   is extremely well conserved from
protozoan to  vertebrates.  It  plays  a  key  role  in  a variety of cellular
processes, such as ATP-dependent  selective  degradation of cellular proteins,
maintenance of  chromatin  structure,  regulation  of  gene expression, stress
response and ribosome biogenesis.

In most  species,  there are many genes coding for ubiquitin. However they can
be classified  into  two  classes.  The  first  class  produces  polyubiquitin
molecules consisting of exact head to tail repeats of ubiquitin. The number of
repeats  is  variable (up  to  twelve in a Xenopus gene).  In  the majority of
polyubiquitin precursors, there is a  final amino-acid  after the last repeat.
The second  class  of genes produces precursor proteins consisting of a single
copy of ubiquitin fused to a C-terminal extension protein (CEP). There are two
types of CEP proteins and both seem to be ribosomal proteins.

Ubiquitin is a globular protein, the  last  four C-terminal residues (Leu-Arg-
Gly-Gly) extending  from the compact structure to form a 'tail', important for
its function.  The latter is mediated by the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin
to target  proteins,  by  an isopeptide linkage between the C-terminal glycine
and the epsilon amino group of lysine residues in the target proteins.

There are a number of proteins which are evolutionary related to ubiquitin:

 - Ubiquitin-like  proteins from  baculoviruses as well as in  some strains of
   bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV).  These proteins are highly similar to
   their eukaryotic counterparts.
 - Mammalian  protein  GDX [4].  GDX is composed  of two domains, a N-terminal
   ubiquitin-like domain of 74 residues and a C-terminal domain of 83 residues
   with some similarity with the thyroglobulin hormonogenic site.
 - Mammalian  protein  FAU  [5].   FAU is a  fusion protein which consist of a
   N-terminal ubiquitin-like protein of 74 residues fused to ribosomal protein
   S30.
 - Mouse protein NEDD-8 [6], a ubiquitin-like protein of 81 residues.
 - Human protein BAT3, a large fusion protein of 1132 residues that contains a
   N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ubl-1 [7].  Ubl-1 is a  fusion protein which
   consist of  a  N-terminal  ubiquitin-like  protein  of 70 residues fused to
   ribosomal protein S27A.
 - Yeast DNA repair protein RAD23 [8]. RAD23 contains a N-terminal domain that
   seems to be distantly, yet significantly, related to ubiquitin.
 - Mammalian RAD23-related proteins RAD23A and RAD23B.
 - Mammalian  BCL-2  binding  athanogene-1  (BAG-1). BAG-1 is a protein of 274
   residues that contains a central ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Human spliceosome associated protein 114 (SAP 114 or SF3A120).
 - Yeast protein DSK2, a protein involved in spindle pole body duplication and
   which contains a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Human  protein  CKAP1/TFCB,  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  protein  alp11 and
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F53F4.3. These proteins contain
   a N-terminal   ubiquitin  domain  and  a  C-terminal  CAP-Gly  domain  (see
   <PDOC00660>).
 - Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  hypothetical  protein SpAC26A3.16. This protein
   contains a N-terminal ubiquitin domain.

 - Yeast protein SMT3.
 - Human ubiquitin-like proteins SMT3A and SMT3B.
 - Human ubiquitin-like protein SMT3C (also known as PIC1; Ubl1, Sumo-1; Gmp-1
   or Sentrin).  This  protein is involved in targeting ranGAP1 to the nuclear
   pore complex protein ranBP2.
 - SMT3-like proteins in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans.

To identify ubiquitin and related proteins  we  have developed a pattern based
on conserved  positions  in the central section of the sequence. A profile was
also developed that spans the complete length of the ubiquitin domain.

-Consensus pattern: K-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-[DESAK]-x(3)-[LIVM]-[PAQ]-x(3)-Q-x-[LIVM]-
                    [LIVMC]-[LIVMFY]-x-G-x(4)-[DE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the RAD23 and SMT3 subfamilies, BAG-1 and SAP 114.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
