* Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur domain profile *
**********************************************

There  are multiple types of iron-sulfur clusters which are grouped into three
main  categories  based  on their atomic content: [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], [4Fe-4S]
(see <PDOC00176>), and other hybrid or mixed metal types. Two general types of
[2Fe-2S]  clusters  are  known and they differ in their coordinating residues.
The  ferredoxin-type  [2Fe-2S] clusters are coordinated to the protein by four
cysteine  residues  (see  <PDOC00175>).  The  Rieske-type  [2Fe-2S] cluster is
coordinated to its protein by two cysteine residues and two histidine residues
[1,2].

The  structure  of  several  Rieske  domains  has been solved (see for example
<PDB:1RIE>)  [3]. It contains three layers of antiparallel beta sheets forming
two  beta  sandwiches.  Both  beta  sandwiches  share the central sheet 2. The
metal-binding  site  is at the top of the beta sandwich formed by the sheets 2
and  3.  The  Fe1  iron  of the Rieske cluster is coordinated by two cysteines
while  the  other  iron  Fe2  is  coordinated by two histidines. Two inorganic
sulfide ions bridge the two iron ions forming a flat, rhombic cluster.

Rieske-type  iron-sulfur  clusters  are  common to electron transfer chains of
mitochondria and chloroplast and to non-heme iron oxygenase systems:

 - The  Rieske  protein  of the Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.10.2.2)
   (also  known  as the bc1 complex or complex III), a complex of the electron
   transport  chains  of  mitochondria  and  of  some  aerobic prokaryotes; it
   catalyzes the oxidoreduction of ubiquinol and cytochrome c.
 - The  Rieske  protein  of chloroplastic plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase
   (EC  1.10.99.1) (also known as the b6f complex). It is functionally similar
   to  the  bc1  complex  and catalyzes the oxidoreduction of plastoquinol and
   cytochrome f.
 - Bacterial  naphthalene  1,2-dioxygenase  subunit alpha, a component of the
   naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) multicomponent enzyme system which catalyzes
   the  incorporation  of both atoms of molecular oxygen into  naphthalene to
   form cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol.
 - Bacterial 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase ferredoxin subunit.
 - Bacterial toluene monoxygenase.
 - Bacterial biphenyl dioxygenase.

The profile we developed covers the whole Rieske domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2007 / Text revised; profiles added; patterns deleted.

-Note:  The  Rieske  profile  is  in  competition  with a profile of a related
 domain, i.e. nirD Rieske-like domain (see <PDOC51300>).
