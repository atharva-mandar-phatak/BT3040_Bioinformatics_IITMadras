* Prokaryotic transglycosylases signature *
*******************************************

Bacterial lytic transglycosylases degrade murein via cleavage of the beta-1,4-
glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, with the
concomitant  formation  of  a  1,6-anhydrobond  in  the  muramic acid residue.
Escherichia coli  has  at  least  three different lytic transglycosylases: two
soluble isozymes  of 65 Kd and 35 Kd and a membrane-bound enzyme of 38 Kd. The
sequence of  the  65 Kd enzyme (gene slt) has been determined [1]. A domain of
about 90  residues  located  near  the  C-terminal section of slt was recently
shown [2] to be present in a number of other prokaryotic and phage proteins:

 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase C (gene mltC).
 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase D (gene mltD).
 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase E (gene mltE).
 - Phage  T7  internal  protein  D  which  may be involved in the lysis of the
   bacterial cell wall during the release of phage progeny.
 - Phage PRD1 gene 7 protein.
 - Alteromonas strain M-1 possible tributyltin chloride resistance protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfhD.

The domain  shared  by  these  proteins  could  be  involved  in     catalytic
activity. The  most  conserved part of this domain is its N-terminal extremity
which we used as a signature pattern. It contains two conserved serines and  a
glutamate which has been shown [3] to be involved in the catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x(3)-E-S-x(3)-[AP]-x(3)-S-x(5)-G-[LIVM]-[LIVMFYW]-
                    x-[LIVMFYW]-x(4)-[SAG]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
