* Calreticulin family signatures *
**********************************

Calreticulin [1] (also known as calregulin, CRP55 or HACBP) is a high-capacity
calcium-binding protein   which   is  present  in  most  tissues  and  located
at the  periphery  of the  endoplasmic (ER) and the sarcoplamic reticulum (SR)
membranes.  It probably plays a role in the storage of calcium in the lumen of
the ER and SR and  it  may  well have other important functions. Structurally,
calreticulin  is  a protein  of  about 400  amino  acid residues consisting of
three domains:

 a) An N-terminal, probably globular, domain  of about 180 amino acid residues
    (N-domain);
 b) A central domain  of about  70 residues (P-domain)  which  contains  three
    repeats of an acidic 17 amino acid motif. This region binds calcium with a
    low-capacity, but a high-affinity;
 c) A C-terminal domain rich in acidic residues and in lysine (C-domain). This
    region binds calcium with a high-capacity but a low-affinity.

Calreticulin is evolutionary related to the following proteins:

 - Onchocerca volvulus antigen RAL-1. RAL-1 is highly similar to calreticulin,
   but  possesses  a  C-terminal  domain rich in lysine and arginine and lacks
   acidic residues  and  is  therefore  not  expected  to bind calcium in that
   region.
 - Calnexin   [2].   A  calcium-binding  protein  that  interacts  with  newly
   synthesized glycoproteins  in the endoplasmic reticulum. It seems to play a
   major role  in  the quality control apparatus of the ER by the retention of
   incorrectly folded proteins.
 - Calmegin  [3]  (or  calnexin-T),  a testis-specific calcium-binding protein
   highly similar to calnexin.

We developed three signature  patterns for  this family of proteins. The first
two patterns are based on conserved regions in the N-domain; the third pattern
corresponds to positions 4 to 16 of the repeated motif in the P-domain.
