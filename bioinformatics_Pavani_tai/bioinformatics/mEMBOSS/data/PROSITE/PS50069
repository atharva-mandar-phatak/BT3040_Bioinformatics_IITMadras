* Cullin family signature and profile *
***************************************

The following proteins are collectively termed cullins [1]:

 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   cul-1   (or  lin-19),  a  protein  required  for
   developmentally programmed  transitions from the G1 phase of the cell cycle
   to the G0 phase or the apoptotic pathway.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans cul-2, cul-3, cul-4 (F45E12.3), cul-5 (ZK856.1) and
   cul-6 (K08E7.7).
 - Mammalian CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A and CUL4B.
 - Mammalian  vasopressin-activated  calcium-mobilizing  receptor  (VACM-1), a
   kidney-specific protein  thought  to  form  a cell surface receptor [2] but
   which does not have any structural hallmarks of a receptor.
 - Drosophila lin19.
 - Yeast  CDC53  [3],  which  acts  in  concert  with CDC4 and UBC3 (CDC34) to
   control the G1-to-S phase transition.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR003w.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC24H6.03.

The cullins are hydrophilic proteins of 740 to 815 amino acids. The C-terminal
extremity is  the  most  conserved part of these proteins. We have developed a
signature pattern from that region.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[KL]-x(2)-[LIVM]-x(2)-L-[IL]-[DEQGVT]-[KRHNQ]-x-
                    [YT]-[LIVM]-x-R-x(5,7)-[FYLV]-x-Y-x-[SAT]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Note: This  documentation  entry  is linked to both a signature pattern and a
 profile. As  the  profile is much more sensitive than the pattern, you should
 use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
