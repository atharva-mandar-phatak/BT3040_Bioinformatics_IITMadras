* DAPIN domain profile *
************************

The DAPIN  (Domain  in Apoptosis and INterferon response) domain is an 80-100-
residue domain  which  is  found  in  the N-terminus of diverse vertebrate and
vertebrate-specific viral    proteins    involved    in   apoptosis,   cancer,
inflammation, and  immune  response. The DAPIN domain can be found alone or in
association with other domains [1,2,3] like CARD (see <PDOC50209>, NACHT, HIN-
200 (see  <PDOC50834>), LRR, SPRY, Caspase (see <PDOC00864>) or Zinc finger B-
box (see  <PDOC50119>).  It has been proposed that the DAPIN domain might have
an adaptor  function,  coupling apoptosis and immune disorders [1,2,3]. It has
been shown  that  the  DAPIN  domain  is  a protein-protein interaction domain
capable of binding to other DAPIN domains [1].

Secondary structure  predictions  have  identified  the DAPIN domain as mostly
alpha-helical and  it  has  been  suggested that it could belong to the DEATH-
domain-fold superfamily,  which  includes the CARD, the DEATH domain (DD) (see
<PDOC50017>) and the DEATH effector domain (DED) (see <PDOC50168>) [1,2,3].

The DAPIN  domain has also been called pyrin domain, pyrin N-terminal homology
domain (PYD) or PAAD (after the protein families pyrin, AIM, ASC death-domain-
like) [2,3].

Proteins known to contain a DAPIN domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  pyrin.  Mutations  in the human pyrin MEFV gene are the cause of
   familial Mediterranean fever.  Pyrin localizes to the perinuclear cytoplasm
   and interacts with a putative Golgi transport protein.
 - Mammalian  ASC  (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD)
   or Pycard  (PYD  and  CARD  containing  protein).  It forms aggregates when
   apoptosis is induced by certain anti-tumor drugs.
 - Human NALP1 and NALP2 (NACHT-, LRR- and PYD-containing proteins).
 - Zebrafish caspases CASPY and CASPY2.
 - Mammalian  HIN-200  family  of  hematopoietic  interferon-inducible nuclear
   proteins. This  family  includes AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), MNDA (myeloid
   nuclear differentiation antigen) and IFI16.
 - Rabbit myxoma virus M013L protein.
 - Rabbit fibroma virus GP013L protein.

We developed a profile that covers the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
