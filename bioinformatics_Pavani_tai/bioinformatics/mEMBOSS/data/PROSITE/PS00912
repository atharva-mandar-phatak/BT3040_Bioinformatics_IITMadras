* Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase signatures *
*******************************************

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.3.3.1)  (DHOdehase)  catalyzes  the fourth
step in   the   de   novo   biosynthesis  of  pyrimidine,  the  conversion  of
dihydroorotate into orotate. DHOdehase is a ubiquitous FAD flavoprotein.

In bacteria  (gene pyrD), DHOdease  is  located    on  the  inner  side of the
cytosolic membrane.  In some yeasts, such as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gene
URA1), it is a cytosolic  protein while in other eukaryotes it is found in the
mitochondria [1].

The sequence  of  DHOdease  is rather well conserved and we have developed two
signature patterns  specific to this enzyme. The first corresponds to a region
in the N-terminal section of the enzyme while the second is located in  the C-
terminal section and seems to be part of the FAD-binding domain.
