* Poly(A)-binding protein C-terminal (PABC) domain profile *
************************************************************

The ~75-residue poly(A)-binding protein C-terminal domain (PABC) is a peptide-
binding domain found in:

 - poly(A)-binding  proteins (PABPs), ubiquitous RNA binding proteins found in
   all eukaryotes.  They  are  implicated  in  stabilizing  mRNA and promoting
   translation. PABPs  are modular proteins consisting of an N-terminal region
   with four  RNA  recognition  motifs  (RRMs)  (see  <PDOC00030>)  and a PABC
   domain.
 - The  HYD  (for  hyperplastic  discs),  EDD or Rat100 family of ubiquitin E3
   protein ligases.   HYD   ubiquitin  ligases  contain  a  HECT  domain  (see
   <PDOC50237>).

The PABC  domain  binds  a  conserved motif of 12-15 amino acids, termed PABP-
interacting motif  (PAM)-2,  with conserved alanine, phenylalanine and proline
residues at position 7, 10 and 12 [1-5].

The PABC   domain   consists   of  five  (see  <PDB:1JH4;  A>)  or  four  (see
<PDB:1IFW; A>)  alpha-helices that form a compact structure with a well packed
hydrophobic core.  Characteristic  to  all PABC domains, the last four helices
fold into  a  right-handed super coil. They encompass the peptide-binding site
and among  PABC domains, sequences conservation is highest among helices 2, 3,
and 5,  which  are  required  for  peptide  recognition  [1-5]. A phylogenetic
analysis of  the  PABC  domain reveals that they can be categorized into three
main classes:  animal, vegetal and a 'divergent' group including Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the HYD family of ubiquitin ligases
[2,3].

The profile we developed covers the entire PABC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
