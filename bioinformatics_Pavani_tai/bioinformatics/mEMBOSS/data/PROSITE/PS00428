* Cell cycle proteins ftsW / rodA / spoVE signature *
*****************************************************

A number of  prokaryotic  proteins  involved in cell cycle processes have been
found [1,2] to be structurally related, these proteins are:

 - Escherichia  coli  and  related  bacteria  cell division protein ftsW. This
   protein plays  a  role  in  the  stabilization of the ftsZ ring during cell
   division.
 - Escherichia  coli  and  related bacteria rod shape-determining protein rodA
   (or mrdB).  It  is required for the expression of the enzymatic activity of
   PBP2, which  is  thought  to  participate in the synthesis of peptidoglycan
   during the initiation of cell elongation.
 - Bacillus subtilis stage V sporulation protein E (spoVE). The exact function
   of spoVE in endospore formation is not known.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ylaO.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ywcF (ipa-42D).
 - Cyanophora paradoxa cyanelle ftsW homolog. This protein may  be involved in
   the organelle division process.

All these proteins are hydrophobic integral membrane protein and contain about
400 residues.  We have selected the best conserved region, which is located in
the C-terminal section, as a signature pattern for these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [NV]-x(5)-[GTR]-[LIVMA]-x-P-[PTLIVME]-x-G-[LIVM]-x(3)-
                    [LIVMFW](2)-S-[YSAQ]-G-G-[STN]-[SA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
