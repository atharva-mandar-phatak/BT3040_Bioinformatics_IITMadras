* Adenylate cyclase class-I signatures *
****************************************

Adenylate cyclase  (EC 4.6.1.1) is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of
cAMP from  ATP. From sequence  data, it has been proposed [1,2] that there are
three different  classes  of adenylate cyclases. Class I cyclases are found in
enterobacteria and related Gram-negative bacteria.  They are proteins of about
850 residues  that  consist  of two functional domains: a N-terminal catalytic
domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain.

As signature  patterns we selected two highly conserved regions, the first one
is located  in  the  catalytic  domain  and  the  second one in the regulatory
domain. The  second  signature  includes  a conserved histidine which could be
phosphorylated  by a PTS system IIA  enzyme, thus leading to the activation of
the cyclase.
