* LDL-receptor class B (LDLRB) repeat profile *
***********************************************

The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)  regulates cholesterol homeostasis
in  mammalian  cells.  LDLR  binds  cholesterol-carrying  LDL, associates with
clathrin-coated  pits,  and  is  internalized  into  acidic endosomes where it
separates  from  its  ligand.  The  ligand is degraded in lysosomes, while the
receptor  returns  to  the cell surface [1]. The LDLR has several domains. The
ligand-binding  domain  contains  seven  LDL  receptor  class  A  repeats (see
<PDOC00929>),  each with three disulfide bonds and a coordinated Ca2+ ion. The
second  conserved  region contains two EGF repeats (see <PDOC00913>), followed
by  six  YWTD or LDL receptor class B repeats and another EGF repeat [2]. This
conserved  region is critical for ligand release and recycling of the receptor
[3].

The  structure  of  the six YWTD repeats of LDL receptor have been solved (see
<PDB:1IJQ>)  [4].  The  six  YWTD  repeats  together  fold  into  a six-bladed
beta-propeller.  Each  blade  of  the  propeller consists of four antiparallel
beta-strands;  the  innermost  strand  of  each  blade  is  labeled  1 and the
outermost  strand,  4.  The  sequence  repeats  are offset with respect to the
blades  of  the  propeller,  such  that any given 40-residue YWTD repeat spans
strands  2–4 of one propeller blade and strand 1 of the subsequent blade. This
offset ensures circularization of the propeller because the last strand of the
final  sequence repeat acts as an innermost strand 1 of the blade that harbors
strands 2–4 from the first sequence repeat.

Some proteins known to contain LDL receptor class B repeats:

 - Animal low-density lipoprotein receptor.
 - Mammalian pro-epidermal growth factor precursor (EGF).
 - Mammalian nidogen-2 precursor, a cell adhesion glycoprotein which is widely
   distributed in basement membranes.
 - Vertebrate sortilin-related receptor precursor.
 - Very  low-density lipoprotein receptor precursor (VLDLR). It binds VLDL and
   transports it into cells by endocytosis.
 - Drosophila  Yolkless  protein.  It is involved in uptake of vitellogenin by
   endocytosis.

The profile we developed covers the whole LDL receptor class B repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
