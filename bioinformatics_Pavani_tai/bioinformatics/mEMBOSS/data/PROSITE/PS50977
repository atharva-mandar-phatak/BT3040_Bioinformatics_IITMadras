* TetR-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  tetR-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  60  residues  present  in  the tetR family of prokaryotic transcription
regulators.  Several of these bacterial regulators are repressors of genes and
operons  for  membrane transport and cell envelope permeability. The family is
named  after  the  tetracycline repressor tetR of enterobacteria found on Tn10
and  other  transposons and plasmids. The 'helix-turn-helix' DNA-binding motif
is  located  in  the  N-terminal extremity of these transcriptional regulators
[1]. The C-terminal part of tetR-type regulators contains several regions that
can  be  involved  in  (1)  binding  of  inducers, which can be drugs, and (2)
oligomerization.  The tetR and camR proteins are dimers, whilst qacR binds its
operator  as  a  pair  of dimers and ethR seems to bind as an octamer [2,3,4].
TetR-type  transcription  regulators  include  several bacterial regulators of
drug  export  systems  that  protect  pathogenic bacteria against antibiotics,
antiseptics, disinfectants and host-encoded antimicrobials [3].

Several  crystal  structures  of  tetR-type transcription regulators have been
resolved  and  their  DNA-binding  domains  are formed by a three-helix bundle
(H1-H3) and the N-terminal part of the following helix 4, which contributes to
the  hydrophobic  center  of  the  DNA-binding  domain  and  links  it  to the
regulatory  domain  [2].  The  helix-turn-helix motif comprises the second and
third  helices,  the third being called the recognition helix as it binds into
the  DNA major groove (see <PDB:1JT0>). The recognition helix of the tetR-type
HTH is shorter than in most HTHs.

Some proteins known to contain a tetR-type HTH domain:

 - Enterobacterial  transposon  and  plasmid  encoded tetR, a repressor of the
   tetracycline  (Tc) exporting protein tetA. Binding of Tc in complex with Mg
   to  tetR abolishes DNA binding to two palindromic operator sites tetO, upon
   which  transcription  of  the tetA and tetR genes is initiated. This is the
   most common resistance mechanism against the antibiotic Tc in Gram-negative
   bacteria and commonly used as a gene-regulation tool in eukaryotes.
 - Staphylococcus  aureus  plasmid encoded qacR, a multidrug binding repressor
   of  the  qacA  multidrug  resistance  pump,  which  confers  resistance  to
   antiseptics  and disinfectants such as QACs (quaternary ammonium compounds)
   [5].
 - Escherichia  coli acrR, a potential transcription repressor involved in the
   regulation of drug efflux operon acrAB.
 - Pseudomonas  putida  plasmid  encoded  camR,  a repressor of the cytochrome
   P-450cam hydroxylase operon, involved in the degradation of camphor.
 - Escherichia coli betI, a choline-induced transcription regulator of the bet
   operon,  involved  in  the  choline-glycine betaine pathway against osmotic
   stress.
 - Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  mtrR, a repressor of the mtrCDE-encoded efflux pump
   system  (for "multiple transferable resistance") and of the farR regulator,
   involved  in  regulation  of  the  resistance to host-derived antimicrobial
   hydrophobic agents.
 - Streptomyces  glaucescens  tcmR,  a repressor of tcmR and tcmA, involved in
   resistance against the antibiotic tetracenomycin C.

As a signature pattern we selected a conserved region that starts six residues
before  the  helix-turn-helix  motif  and  ends seven residues after the H-T-H
motif.  We also developed a profile that covers the entire HTH and DNA-binding
domain, from the first helix and including the major part of the fourth helix,
and allows a more sensitive detection.
