* Urocanase signature *
***********************

Urocanase [1]  (EC 4.2.1.49) (also known as imidazolonepropionate hydrolase or
urocanate hydratase)  is  the  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the second step in the
degradation of     histidine,     the     hydration    of    urocanate    into
imidazolonepropionate. Urocanase is found in some bacteria (gene hutU), in the
liver of  many  vertebrates  and  has  also  been found in the plant Trifolium
repens (white clover).

Urocanase is  a protein of about 60 Kd, it binds tightly to NAD(+) and uses it
as an  electrophil  cofactor.  We  have developed a signature pattern based on
a conserved region in the C-terminal part of the enzyme.

-Consensus pattern: R-D-H-x-D-x-[GS]-[GS]-x(2)-S-P-x-R-E-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: August 2002 / Pattern and text revised.
