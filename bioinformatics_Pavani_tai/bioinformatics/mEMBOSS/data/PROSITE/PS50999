* Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II signature and profiles *
**********************************************************

Cytochrome  c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1) [1,2] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex
which  is a component of the respiratory chain and is involved in the transfer
of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is
located  in  the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is
found  in  the  plasma  membrane.  The enzyme complex consists of 3-4 subunits
(prokaryotes) to up to 13 polypeptides (mammals).

Subunit  2  (CO II) transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to the catalytic
subunit  1.  It  contains two adjacent transmembrane regions in its N-terminus
and  the  major  part  of  the protein is exposed to the periplasmic or to the
mitochondrial intermembrane space, respectively. CO II provides the substrate-
binding  site  and  contains  a  copper  center  called  Cu(A), located in the
extramembrane  domain  (see  <PDB:1OCZ;  B>), probably the primary acceptor in
cytochrome  c  oxidase.  An  exception  is  the  corresponding  subunit of the
cbb3-type  oxidase which lacks the copper A redox-center. Several bacterial CO
II have a C-terminal extension that contains a covalently bound heme c.

It has been shown [3,4] that nitrous oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.6) (gene nosZ)
of Pseudomonas has sequence similarity in its C-terminus to CO II. This enzyme
is part of the bacterial respiratory system which is activated under anaerobic
conditions in  the presence of nitrate or nitrous oxide. NosZ is a periplasmic
homodimer that  contains  a  dinuclear copper center, probably located in a 3-
dimensional fold  similar  to the cupredoxin-like fold that has been suggested
for the copper-binding site of CO II [3].

The  dinuclear  purple copper center is formed by 2 histidines and 2 cysteines
[5].  We used this region as a signature pattern. The conserved valine and the
conserved methionine are said to be involved in stabilizing the copper-binding
fold  by  interacting  with  each  other.  We also developed two profiles, one
directed against the transmembrane region and one against the copper center.

-Consensus pattern: V-x-H-x(33,40)-C-x(3)-C-x(3)-H-x(2)-M
           [The 2 C's and the 2 H's are copper ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Paramecium  primaurelia  as well as in some plants where the pattern ends
 with Thr; an RNA editing event at this position could change this Thr to Met.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Cytochrome cbb(3) subunit 2 does not belong to this family.
