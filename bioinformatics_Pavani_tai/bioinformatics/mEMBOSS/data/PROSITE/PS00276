* Channel forming colicins signature *
**************************************

Colicins   are plasmid-encoded  polypeptide    toxins  produced by and  active
against Escherichia coli and  closely related bacteria.    The channel-forming
colicins are transmembrane proteins that depolarize the  cytoplasmic membrane,
leading to dissipation  of  cellular energy [1,2].  Colicins A, B, E1, Ia, Ib,
and N belong to that group. The N-terminal part of these colicins  is involved
in their uptake; the central part is important for  binding to outer  membrane
receptors and the C-terminal part is the channel-forming region.

As a signature for  this type  of  colicins, we  have selected one of the most
conserved region of the channel-forming domain.

-Consensus pattern: T-x(2)-W-x-P-[LIVMFY](3)-x(2)-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1990 / Text revised.
