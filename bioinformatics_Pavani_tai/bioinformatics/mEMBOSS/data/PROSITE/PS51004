***********************
* Sema domain profile *
***********************

The 500  amino  acid Sema domain is a receptor recognition and binding module,
which is found near the N-terminus of the eukaryotic and viral proteins:

 - Semaphorins,  a  large  group  of  secreted,  transmembrane,  or GPI-linked
   proteins, some  of  which  are known to act as repulsive axon guidance cues
   during development or to be involved in immune function,
 - Plexins, receptors for multiple classes of semaphorins,
 - MET-hepatocyte growth factor (or scatter-factor) receptor.

The Sema  domain  can be found associated with other domains such as PSI, IPT,
Ig-like and TSP1 (see <PDOC50092>) [1,2].

The Sema  domain  is  characterized  by  a conserved set of cysteine residues,
which form  four  disulfide  bonds to stabilize the structure. The Sema domain
fold is a variation of the beta propeller topology, with seven blades radially
arranged around  a  central axis (see <PDB:1Q47>). Each blade contains a four-
stranded (strands  A  to  D) antiparallel beta sheet. The inner strand of each
blade (A) lines the channel at the center of the propeller, with strands B and
C of  the  same  repeat  radiating  outward,  and  strand D of the next repeat
forming the  outer edge of the blade. The large size of the Sema domain is not
due to  a  single inserted domain but results from the presence of additionnal
secondary structure  elements  inserted in most of the blades. The Sema domain
uses a  'loop  and  hook' system to close the circle between the first and the
last blades.  The blades are constructed sequentially with an N-terminal beta-
strand closing the circle by providing the outermost strand (D) of the seventh
(C-terminal) blade.  The  beta-propeller is further stabilized by an extension
of the  N-terminus,  providing  an  additional, fifth beta-strand on the outer
edge of blade 6 [3,4,5].

The profile we developed covers the entire Sema domain.
