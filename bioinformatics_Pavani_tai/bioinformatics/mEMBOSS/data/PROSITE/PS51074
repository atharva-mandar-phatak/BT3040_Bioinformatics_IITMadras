* Zinc finger DPH-type profile *
********************************

Diphthamide  is a unique post-translationally modified histidine residue found
only  in  translation  elongation  factor  2  (eEF-2).  It  is  conserved from
archaebacteria  to  humans  and  serves  as the target for diphteria toxin and
Pseudomonas  exotoxin  A. These two toxins catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose
to  diphtamide  on  eEF-2,  thus  inactivating eEF-2, halting cellular protein
synthesis, and causing cell death [1].

The biosynthesis of diphtamide is dependent on at least five proteins, DPH1 to
-5, and a still unidentified amidating enzyme. DPH3 and DPH4 share a conserved
region  which  encode  a putative zinc finger, the DHP-type or CSL-type (after
the  conserved motif of the final cysteine) zinc finger [2,3]. The function of
this motif is unknown.

The profile we developed covers the whole DPH-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
