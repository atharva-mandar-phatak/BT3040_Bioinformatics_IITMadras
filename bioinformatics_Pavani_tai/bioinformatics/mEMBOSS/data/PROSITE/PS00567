* Phosphoribulokinase signature *
*********************************

Phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19) (PRK) [1,2] is  one  of the enzymes specific
to the Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle which is the  major route by
which carbon dioxide is assimilated and reduced by autotrophic organisms.  PRK
catalyzes  the  ATP-dependent  phosphorylation  of  ribulose 5-phosphate  into
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate which is the substrate for RubisCO.

PRK's of diverse origins show different properties with respect to the size of
the protein, the subunit  structure, or the enzymatic regulation.  However  an
alignment of  the  sequences  of  PRK   from plants, algae, photosynthetic and
chemoautotrophic  bacteria  shows  that  there  are  a few regions of sequence
similarity. As a signature pattern we have selected one of these regions.

-Consensus pattern: K-[LIVM]-x-R-D-x(3)-R-G-x-[ST]-x-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 1991 / First entry.
