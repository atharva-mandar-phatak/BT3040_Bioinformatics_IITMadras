* TROVE domain profile *
************************

The TROVE  (Telomerase,  Ro and Vault) domain is a module of ~300-500 residues
that is   found   in   TEP1   and   Ro60   the  protein  components  of  three
ribonucleoprotein particles.  The  TROVE  domain  is  also  found in bacterial
ribonucleoproteins suggesting  an  ancient origin of these ribonucleoproteins.
The TROVE  domain can be found associated with other domains, such as the VWFA
domain (see  <PDOC50234>), the TEP1 N-terminal domain, the NACHT-NTPase domain
(see <PDOC50837>),  and  WD-40 repeats (see <PDOC00574>). The TROVE domain may
be involved  in  binding  the  RNA  components  of  the  three RNPs, which are
telomerase RNA, Y RNA and vault RNA [1].

The TROVE  domain  contains  a  few  absolutely conserved residues. As none of
these conserved  residues  are  the  polar type of amino acids found in active
sites, it seems unlikely that this region has an enzymatic function [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire TROVE domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2004 / First entry.
