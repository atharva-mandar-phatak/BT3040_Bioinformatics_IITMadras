* Band 7 protein family signature *
***********************************

Mammalian band  7  protein [1] (also known as 7.2B or stomatin) is an integral
membrane phosphoprotein   of  red  blood  cells  thought  to  regulate  cation
conductance by  interacting  with  other proteins of the junctional complex of
the membrane  skeleton.  Structurally, band  7  is evolutionary related to the
following proteins:

 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  protein  mec-2 [2]. Mec-2 positively regulates the
   activity of  the putative mechanosensory transduction channel. It may links
   the mechanosensory  channel  and  the microtubule cytoskeleton of the touch
   receptor neurons.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans proteins sto-1 to sto-4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-1.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybbK.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY277.09.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1128.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0827.

Structurally all  these  proteins  consist  of a short N-terminal domain which
is followed  by  a  transmembrane  region and a variable size (from 170 to 350
residues) C-terminal domain.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  conserved region located about 110
residues after the transmembrane domain.
