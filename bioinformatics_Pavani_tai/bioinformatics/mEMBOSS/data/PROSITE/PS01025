*************************************************************

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a   serine/threonine  phosphatase involved in
many  aspects of  cellular  function  including   the  regulation of metabolic
enzymes and  proteins  involved  in  signal  transduction.  PP2A is a trimeric
enzyme that consists of a core composed of a catalytic subunit associated with
a 65 Kd  regulatory subunit (PR65),  also called subunit A;  this complex then
associates with a third  variable subunit (subunit B),  which confers distinct
properties to the holoenzyme [1].  One of the forms of the variable subunit is
a 55  Kd  protein  (PR55)  which  is highly conserved in mammals - where three
isoforms are known to exist -, Drosophila and yeast (gene CDC55). This subunit
could perform a substrate recognition function or be responsible for targeting
the enzyme complex to the appropriate subcellular compartment.

As signature  patterns, we selected  two  perfectly  conserved sequences of 15
residues; one  located  in  the  N-terminal region, the other in the center of
the protein.
