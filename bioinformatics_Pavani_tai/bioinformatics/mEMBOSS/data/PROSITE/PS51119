****************************
* TAFH/NHR1 domain profile *
****************************

The  TAF  homology (TAFH) or Nervy homology region 1 (NHR1) domain is a domain
of 95-100 amino acids present in eukaryotic proteins of the MTG/ETO family and
whereof  the  core  ~75-80  residues  occur in TAF proteins. The transcription
initiation  TFIID  complex  is  composed  of  TATA binding protein (TBP) and a
number  of  TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFH/NHR1 domain is named after
fruit  fly  TATA-box-associated  factor 110 (TAF110), human TAF105 and TAF130,
and the fruit fly protein Nervy, which is a homologue of human MTG8/ETO [1,2].
The human eight twenty-one (ETO or MTG8) and related myeloid transforming gene
products  MTGR1  and  MTG16  as  well  as the Nervy protein contain the NHR1-4
domains. The NHR1/TAFH domain occurs in the N-terminal part of these proteins,
while a MYND-type zinc finger (see <PDOC50865>) forms the NHR4 domain [3]. The
TAFH/NHR1  domain  can  be  involved  in  protein-protein interactions, e.g in
MTG8/ETO with HSP90 and Gfi-1 [4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a TAFH/NHR1 domain:

 - Mammalian  MTG8/ETO protein, which is involved in the t(8;21) form of acute
   myeloid leukemia and is an inhibitor of C/EBP beta in early adipogenesis.
 - Mammalian  myeloid  transforming  gene  (MTG)  or  eight  twenty-one  (ETO)
   proteins,  which  can  mediate  the protein complex formation among nuclear
   corepressors,   chromatin-modifying   enzymes  (HDACs),  and  transcription
   factors.
 - Drosophila  melanogaster  Nervy  protein,  a homologue of MTG8/ETO which is
   involved in neuronal development during segmentation of Drosophila embryos.
 - Drosophila  melanogaster  transcription  initiation  factor  TFIID  110 kDa
   subunit (TAF110) and mammalian homologue (TAFII130/135), which can interact
   with Sp1 and which may be a transcriptional coactivator.

The profile we developed covers the entire TAFH/NHR1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
