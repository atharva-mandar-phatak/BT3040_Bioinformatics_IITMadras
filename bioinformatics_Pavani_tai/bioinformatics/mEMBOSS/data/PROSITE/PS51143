* MT-A70-like family profile *
******************************

N6-methyladenosine (m6A)  is  present at internal sites in eukaryotic mRNA. It
is present  only  within  a defined sequence context that has been shown to be
conserved across  species  from  plants  to  man.  Despite  its  ubiquity  and
conserved sequence   specificity,   the   functional   significance   of  this
modification remains a mystery [1,2].

MT-A70 is   the   S-adenosylmethionine-binding  subunit  of  human  mRNA  [N6-
adenosine]-methyltransferase (MTase),  an  enzyme  that  sequence-specifically
methylates adenines  in pre-mRNAs. Proteins with sequence similarity to MT-A70
have been  identified  in  eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The resulting family is
defined by  sequence  similarity  in  the  carboxyl-proximal  regions  of  the
respective proteins. The amino-proximal regions of the eukaryotic proteins are
highly diverse,  often  Pro-rich,  and  are  conserved  only within individual
subfamilies [2].  Corresponding regions are not present in prokaryotic members
of the  family. MT-A70-like proteins contain examples of some of the consensus
methyltransferase motifs that have been derived from mutational and structural
studies of   bacterial   DNA  methyltransferases,  including  the  universally
conserved motif  IV catalytic residues and a proposed motif I (AdoMet binding)
element [1].  The  MT-A70-like  family comprises four subfamilies with varying
degrees of  interrelatedness. One subfamily is a small group of bacterial DNA:
m6A MTases.  The  other three are paralogous eukaryotic lineages, two of which
have not  been  associated  with  MTase  activity  but  include  proteins that
regulate mRNA   levels   via   unknown  mechanisms  apparently  not  involving
methylation [1].

Some proteins known to belong to the MT-A70-like family are listed below:

 - Human N6-adenosine-methyltransferase 70 kDa subunit (MT-A70) (EC 2.1.1.62).
 - Yeast N6-adenosine-methyltransferase IME4 (EC 2.1.1.62), which is important
   for induction of sporulation.
 - Yeast  karyogamy  protein KAR4, a phosphoprotein required for expression of
   karyogamy-specific genes  during  mating.  It  also acts during mitosis and
   meiosis. It has been suggested that KAR4 is inactive for methyltransfer and
   may not even bind AdoMet.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
