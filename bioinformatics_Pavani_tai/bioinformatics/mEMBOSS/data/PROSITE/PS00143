****************************************************
* Insulinase family, zinc-binding region signature *
****************************************************

A number of proteases dependent on divalent cations  for  their activity  have
been shown [1,2] to belong to one family, on the basis of sequence similarity.
These enzymes are listed below.

 - Insulinase  (EC  3.4.24.56)  (also  known as insulysin or insulin-degrading
   enzyme or  IDE),  a  cytoplasmic  enzyme  which seems to be involved in the
   cellular  processing of insulin, glucagon and other small polypeptides.
 - Escherichia coli  protease III  (EC 3.4.24.55)  (pitrilysin)  (gene ptr), a
   periplasmic enzyme that degrades small peptides.
 - Mitochondrial  processing  peptidase  (EC  3.4.24.64)  (MPP).  This  enzyme
   removes the  transit  peptide  from the precursor form of proteins imported
   from the cytoplasm across the  mitochondrial inner membrane. It is composed
   of two  nonidentical  homologous subunits termed alpha and beta.  The  beta
   subunit seems  to  be  catalytically  active    while the alpha subunit has
   probably lost its activity.
 - Nardilysin (EC 3.4.24.61) (N-arginine dibasic convertase or NRD convertase)
   this mammalian  enzyme  cleaves peptide substrates on the N-terminus of Arg
   residues in dibasic stretches.
 - Klebsiella  pneumoniae  protein  pqqF.  This  protein  is  required for the
   biosynthesis of the coenzyme pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ). It is thought
   to be  protease  that  cleaves peptide bonds in a small peptide (gene pqqA)
   thus providing  the  glutamate  and  tyrosine  residues  necessary  for the
   synthesis of PQQ.
 - Yeast protein AXL1, which is involved in axial budding [3].
 - Eimeria bovis sporozoite developmental protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yddC and HI1368, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ymxG.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C28F5.4 and F56D2.1.

It should  be  noted  that  in addition to the above enzymes, this family also
includes the  core  proteins  I  and II of the mitochondrial bc1 complex (also
called cytochrome  c  reductase  or  complex III), but the situation as to the
activity or lack of activity of these subunits is quite complex:

 - In mammals and yeast, core proteins I and II lack enzymatic activity.
 - In Neurospora crassa and in potato core protein I is equivalent to the beta
   subunit of MPP.
 - In Euglena gracilis, core protein I seems to be active, while subunit II is
   inactive.

These proteins do not  share  many  regions of  sequence  similarity; the most
noticeable is  in  the  N-terminal  section.  This region includes a conserved
histidine followed,  two  residues later by a glutamate and another histidine.
In pitrilysin, it has been shown [4] that this H-x-x-E-H  motif is involved in
enzyme activity;  the two histidines bind zinc and the glutamate  is necessary
for catalytic activity. Non active members  of  this family have lost from one
to three of these active site residues. We  developed a signature pattern that
detect active members of this family as well as some inactive members.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(8,9)-G-x-[STA]-H-[LIVMFY]-[LIVMC]-[DERN]-[HRKL]-
                    [LMFAT]-x-[LFSTH]-x-[GSTAN]-[GST]
                    [The 2 H's are zinc ligands]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL   active
 members as  well  as  all  MPP  alpha subunits and core II subunits. Does not
 detect inactive core I subunits.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family M16 in the classification of peptidases
 [5,E1].
