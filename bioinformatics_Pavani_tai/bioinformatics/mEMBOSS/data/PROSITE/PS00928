* Trehalase signatures *
************************

Trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28)  is  the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the
disaccharide alpha,alpha-trehalose  yielding  two  glucose subunits [1]. It is
an enzyme  found  in  a  wide variety of organisms and whose sequence has been
highly conserved throughout evolution.

As signature  patterns  we  selected two of the most highly conserved regions.
The first pattern is located in the central section,  the second one is in the
C-terminal region.

-Consensus pattern: P-G-G-R-F-x-E-x-Y-x-W-D-x-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: Q-W-D-x-P-x-[GAV]-W-[PAS]-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family 37  in  the  classification of glycosyl
 hydrolases [2,E1].

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
