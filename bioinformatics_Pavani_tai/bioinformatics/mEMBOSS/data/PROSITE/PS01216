* ATP-citrate lyase / succinyl-CoA ligases signatures *
*******************************************************

Four different enzymes  share a similar catalytic mechanism which involves the
phosphorylation  by ATP (or GTP) of a specific histidine residue in the active
site. These enzymes are:

 - ATP citrate-lyase (EC 2.3.3.8) [1], the primary  enzyme responsible for the
   synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA  in many tissues, catalyzes the formation
   of acetyl-CoA  and oxaloacetate from citrate and CoA  with the  concomitant
   hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate.  ATP-citrate lyase is a tetramer of
   identical subunits.
 - Succinyl-CoA ligase  (GDP-forming)  (EC 6.2.1.4)  [2]  is  a  mitochondrial
   enzyme  that  catalyzes  the substrate  level  phosphorylation  step of the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle: the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with
   a concomitant  hydrolysis  of  GTP to GDP and phosphate.   This enzyme is a
   dimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunits.
 - Succinyl-CoA ligase (ADP-forming) (EC 6.2.1.5) [3]  is  a  bacterial enzyme
   that during aerobic metabolism functions in the citric acid cycle, coupling
   the  hydrolysis  of  succinyl-CoA to  the synthesis  of ATP.  It  can  also
   function in the  other  direction  for anabolic purposes.  This enzyme is a
   tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits.
 - Malate-CoA   ligase (EC 6.2.1.9) (malyl-CoA synthetase) [4], is a bacterial
   enzyme that  forms  malyl-CoA  from  malate  and  CoA  with the concomitant
   hydrolysis of   ATP  to ADP and phosphate. Malate-CoA ligase is composed of
   two different subunits.

We developed three signature patterns for these enzymes, the first corresponds
to a glycine-rich conserved region, located in the second half of ATP  citrate
lyase and in the alpha subunits of succinyl-CoA ligases and malate-CoA ligase.
The second pattern, which is located some 50 residues to the C-terminal of the
first one, includes the active site phosphorylated histidine residue. The last
pattern corresponds  to  a  conserved  region located in the first half of ATP
citrate lyase  and in the beta subunits of succinyl-CoA ligases and malate-CoA
ligase.
