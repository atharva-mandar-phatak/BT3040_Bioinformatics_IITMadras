* GON domain profile *
**********************

The ADAMTSs  (a  disintegrin  and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin
type-1 modules)  are  a  family of zinc dependent metalloproteinases that play
important roles  in  a  variety  of  normal and pathological conditions. These
enzymes show   a   complex  domain  organization  including  signal  sequence,
propeptide, metalloproteinase   domain   (see  <PDOC50215>),  disintegrin-like
domain (see  <PDOC00351>), central TS-1 motif (see <PDOC50092>), cysteine-rich
region, and a variable number of TS-like repeats at the C-terminal region. The
GON domain  is  a  ~200-residue  module,  whose  presence  is  a hallmark of a
subfamily of  structurally  and  evolutionarily  related  ADAMTSs, called GON-
ADAMTSs. The  GON domain is characterized by the presence of several conserved
cysteine residues and is likely to be globular [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a GON domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian ADAMTS-9.
 - Mammalian ADAMTS-20.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   gon-1,   a   protease   required   for   gonadal
   morphogenesis.

The profile we developed covers the entire GON domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / First entry.
