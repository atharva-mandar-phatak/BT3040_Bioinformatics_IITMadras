* Cytochrome c and c1 heme lyases signatures *
**********************************************

Cytochrome c heme  lyase (CCHL) (EC 4.4.1.17)  and   cytochrome  c1 heme lyase
(CC1HL) [1] are mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of
a heme group on two cysteine residues of cytochrome c and c1.

These  two enzymes  are  functionally and evolutionary related.  As  signature
patterns, we  selected  two  conserved  regions:  the  first is located in the
central section  and  the  second  in  the  C-terminal  section. Both patterns
contain conserved  histidine,  tryptophan  and  acidic residues which could be
important for  the  interaction of the enzymes with the apoproteins and/or the
heme group.

-Consensus pattern: H-N-x(2)-N-E-x(2)-W-[NQKRS]-x(4)-W-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: P-F-D-R-H-D-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
