* Endonuclease III signatures *
*******************************

Escherichia coli  endonuclease  III  (EC  4.2.99.18)  (gene  nth) [1] is a DNA
repair enzyme  that  acts  both  as  a  DNA  N-glycosylase,  removing oxidized
pyrimidines from  DNA,  and  as  an  apurinic/apyrimidinic  (AP) endonuclease,
introducing a  single-strand  nick at the site from which the damaged base was
removed. Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single 4Fe-4S
cluster. The  4Fe-4S  cluster  does  not  seem  to  be important for catalytic
activity, but  is  probably  involved  in the proper positioning of the enzyme
along the DNA strand [2].

Endonuclease III is evolutionary related to the following proteins:

 - Fission yeast endonuclease III homolog (gene nth1) [3].
 - Escherichia coli and related protein DNA repair protein mutY, which  is  an
   adenine glycosylase.  MutY  is  a  larger  protein  (350  amino acids) than
   endonuclease III (211 amino acids).
 - Micrococcus  luteus  ultraviolet  N-glycosylase/AP  lyase  which  initiates
   repair at cis-syn pyrimidine dimers.
 - ORF10 in plasmid pFV1 of  the  thermophilic archaebacteria Methanobacterium
   thermoformicicum [4].  Restriction methylase m.MthTI,  which  is encoded by
   this plasmid, generates 5-methylcytosine which  is  subject  to deamination
   resulting in G-T mismatches. This protein could correct these mismatches.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL015c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC26A3.02.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R10E4.5.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0613.

The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which  are  all  located in a 17
amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III.  A similar region
is also present in the central section of mutY and in  the C-terminus of ORF10
and of  the  Micrococcus  UV  endonuclease. The 4Fe-4S cluster region does not
exist in YAL015c.

We developed two signature patterns for these proteins:  the first corresponds
to the  core  of the iron-sulfur binding domain, the second corresponds to the
best conserved region in the catalytic core of these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(3)-[KRSN]-P-[KRAGL]-C-x(2)-C-x(5)-C
                    [The 4 C's are 4Fe-4S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for nth1 and MJ0613.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [GSTENA]-x-[LIVMF]-P-x(5)-[LIVMW]-x(2,3)-[LI]-[PAS]-G-
                    [IV]-[GA]-x(3)-[GAC]-x(2,3)-[LIVMA]-x(1,2)-[GSALVI]-
                    [LIVMFYW]-[GANKD]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
