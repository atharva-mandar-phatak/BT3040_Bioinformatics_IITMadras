* Frataxin family signature and profile *
*****************************************

Frataxin (gene  FRDA)  [1]  is  a  mitochondrial protein, which is involved in
Friedreich's ataxia  (FA),  an  autosomal  recessive, progressive degenerative
disease characterized   by   neurodegeneration,  cardiomyopathy  and  diabetes
mellitus. Frataxin  defect causes mitochondrial iron accumulation, which could
lead to   specific   deficiency   in  the  activities  of  aconitases  and  of
mitochondrial iron-sulfur  dependent enzymes, as suggested by biochemical data
[2].

From the  X-ray  structure  of  human  frataxin [3], it seems that some of the
conserved residues are involved in binding one iron atom.

Frataxin is evolutionary related to the following proteins:

 - Yeast  YFH1  [4],  a protein that seems to be involved in the regulation of
   mitochondrial iron efflux.
 - Bacterial cyaY proteins of unknown function. Inactivation of the protein in
   E.coli has no visible phenotype [5].

As  a signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in the central section
of these proteins. We also developed a profile that covers the whole conserved
region.

-Consensus pattern: [IV]-[LIVF]-[NS]-[KRTAVSL]-[QH]-x-[PAVS]-x(2)-[EQ]-[LIVM]-
                    W-x-[STA]-[STAD]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
