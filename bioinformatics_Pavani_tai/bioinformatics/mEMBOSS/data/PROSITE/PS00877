******************************************

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.42) (IDO) [1] is an enzyme responsible
for the  conversion of tryptophan and other indole derivatives to kynurenines.
In mammals, IDO is induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and responsible for
some of  its  anti-proliferative  effects.  The  degradative  action of IDO on
tryptophan leads  to cell death by starvation of this essential and relatively
scarce amino acid. IDO is a heme-containing enzyme of about 400 amino acids.

Other proteins that are evolutionarily related to IDO are:

 - Myoglobin  from  the  red  muscle  of  the  gastropods  Nordotis madaka and
   Sulculus diversicolor  [2].  These  unusual globins lack enzymatic activity
   but have kept the heme group.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR078w.

As a  signature  for  the  IDO  family, we selected two conserved regions. The
first is  located    in  the central section and is rich in glycine and serine
residues; the  second  is  located  in  the  second  third of the sequence and
contains a  conserved  histidine  that could serve as a proximal ligand to the
heme iron.
