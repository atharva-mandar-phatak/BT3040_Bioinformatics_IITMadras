* DDC / GAD / HDC / TyrDC pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site *
***************************************************************

Three different  enzymes  -  all pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases -  seem to
share regions of sequence similarity [1,2,3,4], especially in the vicinity  of
the lysine  residue  which  serves  as  the attachment site for the pyridoxal-
phosphate (PLP) group. These enzymes are:

 - Glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) (GAD).  Catalyzes the decarboxylation
   of glutamate into the neurotransmitter GABA (4-aminobutanoate).
 - Histidine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.22) (HDC).  Catalyzes the decarboxylation
   of histidine to histamine. There are two completely unrelated types of HDC:
   those that  use  PLP    as  a cofactor (found in Gram-negative bacteria and
   mammals), and those that contain a covalently bound pyruvoyl residue (found
   in Gram-positive bacteria).
 - Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.28)  (DDC),  also  known  as
   L-dopa  decarboxylase  or   tryptophan  decarboxylase.   DDC  catalyzes the
   decarboxylation of  tryptophan to tryptamine.  It  also  acts on 5-hydroxy-
   tryptophan and dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa).
 - Tyrosine  decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.25) (TyrDC) which converts tyrosine into
   tyramine, a precursor of isoquinoline alkaloids and various amides.
 - Cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.29).
 - L-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.-) (DABA decarboxylase).

These enzymes are collectively known as group II decarboxylases [3,4].

-Consensus pattern: S-[LIVMFYW]-x-{KG}-x(3)-K-[LIVMFYWGH]-[LIVMFYWG]-x-{R}-x-
                    [LIVMFYW]-{V}-[CA]-x(2)-[LIVMFYWQ]-{K}-x-[RK]
                    [K is the pyridoxal-P attachment site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for a probable Caenorhabditis elegans DDC and for Petunia GAD.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.
