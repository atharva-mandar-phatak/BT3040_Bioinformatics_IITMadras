*********************************************************************

Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase  (EC 1.1.1.34)  (HMG-CoA reductase)
[1,2] catalyzes the NADP-dependent  synthesis  of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA.   In vertebrates, HMG-CoA  reductase  is the rate-limiting
enzyme in  cholesterol biosynthesis. In plants, mevalonate is the precursor of
all isoprenoid compounds.

HMG-CoA reductase  is a membrane bound enzyme.  Structurally, it consists of 3
domains. An N-terminal region that contains a variable number of transmembrane
segments (7 in mammals, insects and fungi; 2 in plants), a linker region and a
C-terminal catalytic domain of approximately 400 amino-acid residues.

In archebacteria  [3] HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the biosynthesis
of the isoprenoids side chains of lipids, seems to be cytoplasmic and lack the
N-terminal hydrophobic domain.

Some bacteria, such  as Pseudomonas mevalonii, can  use mevalonate as the sole
carbon source.   These   bacteria   use  an  NAD-dependent  HMG-CoA  reductase
(EC 1.1.1.88)  to  deacetylate  mevalonate into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
[3]. The Pseudomonas enzyme is structurally  related  to  the catalytic domain
of NADP-dependent HMG-CoA reductases.

We selected   three  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns  for  HMG-CoA
reductases. The  first  is  located in the center of the catalytic domain, the
second is  a glycine-rich region located in the C-terminal section of the same
catalytic domain  and  the third is also located in the C-terminal section and
contains an histidine residue that seems [4] to be implicated in the catalytic
mechanism as a general base.
