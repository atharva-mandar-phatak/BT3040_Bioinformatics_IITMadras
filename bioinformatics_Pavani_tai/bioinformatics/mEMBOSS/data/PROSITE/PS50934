* SWIRM domain profile *
************************

The SWIRM  domain  is  a  globular  module of about 85 residues that was named
after the  proteins  SWI3, RSC8 and MOIRA in which it was first recognized. It
is found  in  eukaryotic  chromatin proteins and several other uncharacterized
proteins. The  SWIRM  domain  occurs  in  various distinct domain-architecture
contexts, suggesting  that  it is an evolutionarily mobile domain. It is found
associated with   other   domains,  such  as  the  ZZ-type  zinc  finger  (see
<PDOC50135>), the  Myb  DNA-binding domain (see <PDOC00037>), the HORMA domain
(see <PDOC50815>),   the   amino-oxidase   domain,   the  chromo  domain  (see
<PDOC00517>) and the JAB1/PAD1domain. The SWIRM domain is predicted to mediate
specific protein-protein  interactions  in  the  assembly of chromatin-protein
complexes [1].

Secondary structure  predictions  indicate the presence of four distinct alpha
helices. Hence  it  is  predicted  that  the  SWIRM domain is likely to form a
globular structure in the form of a tetrahelical bundle [1].

Some proteins known to contain a SWIRM domain are listed below:

 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  transcription  regulatory  protein SWI3. It is a
   component of the SWI/SNF global transcription activator complex.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSC8. It is a component of the RSC complex.
 - Drosophila MOIRA, a brahma-associated putative chromatin-remodeling factor.
 - Vertebrate SWI/SNF complex 155 kDa subunit (BAF155).
 - Vertebrate SWI/SNF complex 170 kDa subunit (BAF170).
 - Rice protein similar to putative SWI/SNF complex subunit BAF170.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  meiotic asynaptic mutant 1 protein, a homolog of the
   yeast HOP1 protein.
 - Eukaryotic  transcriptional  adapter  2-like  (ADA2-like)  protein. It is a
   chromatin associated  protein  that  is  known  to  mediate protein-protein
   interactions.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  suppressor  of  presenilin  5,  a  potential amine
   oxidoreductase, which probably acts as a corepressor protein.

The profile we developed covers the entire SWIRM domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
