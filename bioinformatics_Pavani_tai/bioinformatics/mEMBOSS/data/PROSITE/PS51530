* Fetuin family signatures and fetuin-A- and fetuin-B-type cystatin domain profiles *
*************************************************************************************

The cystatin  superfamily  consists  of  a  large  group  of  cystatin domain-
containing proteins, most of which are reversible and tight-binding inhibitors
of the  papain (C1) and legumain (C13) families of cysteine proteases. Fetuins
have been  identified  as  main  members  of  the cystatin superfamily and are
composed of  fetuin-A  and fetuin-B. Fetuins are characterized by the presence
of 2 N-terminally located cystatin-like repeats (see <PDOC00259>) and a unique
C-terminal domain  which  is  not  present  in  other proteins of the cystatin
family [1,2,3].

Fetuin-A [2,3,4,5,6]  also  called  alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, bone sialic acid-
containing protein (BSP), countertrypin or PP63, is expressed in a tissue- and
development-specific pattern which seems to be significantly different between
species. A  wide  functional  diversity  of fetuin-A has been observed. It has
been shown  to  function  in  many  physiological  aspects, such as fatty acid
transport, regulation   of   insulin   activity  and  hepatocyte-growth-factor
activity, response  to  systemic  inflammation,  and  inhibition  of  unwanted
mineralization. It  has  been demonstrated that fetuin-A plays important roles
during developmental processes, including osteogenesis, myotubule, fetal brain
and nervous  system  development. Human fetuin is a heterodimer of chain A and
B, which  are  derived  by  cleavage  of  a  connecting  peptide from a common
precursor. Snake  fetuin  family proteins (antihemorrhagic proteins HSF, BJ46a
and MSF and HLP-A and HLP-B) show a significant degree of sequence homology to
fetuin-A [7].

Fetuin-B has  been  suggested  to  be  involved in systemic inflammation, as a
tumor suppressor,  and  as  a  basic calcium phosphate precipitation inhibitor
[8,9].

The cystatin  fold  is  formed  by  a  five  stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet
wrapped around a five-turn alpha-helix [1].

As shown  in  the  schematic  representation  fetuin contains twelve conserved
cysteines involved in six disulfide bonds.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of pattern 1 (upper line) and 2 (lower line).

Eleven of  the twelve invariant cysteines are located within the cystatin-like
repeats. This domain has been choosen to assign a signature pattern.  The 12th
cysteine is  located near the C-terminus of the protein, separated by a region
of variable  length. A second signature pattern has been developed from a well
conserved region  around  the  2nd  invariant cysteine. We also developped two
profiles, which  cover  respectively  the fetuin-A- and fetuin-B-type cystatin
domains.
