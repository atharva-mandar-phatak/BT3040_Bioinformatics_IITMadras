* CAP protein signatures *
**************************

In budding  and fission yeasts the CAP protein is a bifunctional protein whose
N-terminal domain  binds  to adenylyl cyclase, thereby enabling that enzyme to
be activated  by upstream regulatory signals, such as Ras. The function of the
C-terminal domain  is  less  clear,  but  it  is  required for normal cellular
morphology and  growth  control  [1].  CAP  is  conserved in higher eukaryotic
organisms where its function is not yet clear [2].

Structurally, CAP  is  a  protein  of 474 to 551 residues which consist of two
domains separated  by  a  proline-rich  hinge. We have developed two signature
patterns, one  corresponds  to  a conserved region in the N-terminal extremity
and the other to a C-terminal region.
