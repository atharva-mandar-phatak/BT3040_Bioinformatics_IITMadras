* Longin domain profile *
*************************

The longin  domain  is  an about 110-residue domain found at the N-terminus of
numerous proteins,  that  structurally  and  (possibly) functionally defines a
novel family  of  vesicle-associated  memmbrane  proteins  (VAMPs) called long
VAMPs or  longins.  The  longin  domain  is associated to a C-terminal domain,
which is  strongly  homologous to the synaptobrevin domain of brevins. Longins
are common  to  yeast,  protists, animals and plants. Wide distribution of the
longin domain  throughout  eukaryotes  suggests  a  generic but very important
function. It has been proposed that the longin domain might be involved in the
regulation of membrane fusion [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire longin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
