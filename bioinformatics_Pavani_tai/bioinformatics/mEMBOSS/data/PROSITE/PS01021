* Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase signature *
********************************************

Coproporphyrinogen III  oxidase  (EC  1.3.3.3)  (coproporphyrinogenase)  [1,2]
catalyzes the   oxidative   decarboxylation  of  coproporphyrinogen  III  into
protoporphyrinogen IX,   a common step in the pathway for the biosynthesis  of
porphyrins such as heme, chlorophyll or cobalamin.

Coproporphyrinogen III  oxidase  is  an  enzyme  that  requires  iron  for its
activity. A  cysteine  seems  to be important for the catalytic mechanism [3].
Sequences from a  variety  of  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  sources show that
this enzyme  has  been  evolutionarily  conserved.  As  a signature pattern we
selected a  highly  conserved region in the central part of the sequence; this
region contains  the  only  conserved  cysteine  and  is rich in charged amino
acids.

-Consensus pattern: K-x-[WQA]-[CA]-x(2)-[FYH](2)-x-[LIVM]-x-[HY]-R-x-E-x-R-G-
                    [LIVMT]-G(2)-[LIVM]-F-[FY]-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Some  bacteria  possess  an  anaerobic  form  of coproporphyrinogen III
 oxidase [4] which does not belong to this family.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
