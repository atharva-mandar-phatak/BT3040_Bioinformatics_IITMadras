*************************************
* Ran binding domain type 1 profile *
*************************************

RanBP  proteins  form  a  heterogeneous family of proteins involved in nuclear
transport.  Among  them, some contain a common region (RanBD1) involved in the
binding  of  Ran,  a  Ras-related  GTPase (see <PDOC00859>). This domain binds
RanGTP  and  increases  the  rate  of  RanGAP1-induced  GTP hydrolysis. RanBD1
displays some similarity with the WASP domain [1,2].

The  crystal  structure  of  RanBD1 of the human protein RanBP2 complexed with
Ran,  bound  to  a  non-hydrolysable  GTP  analogue,  has  been  resolved (see
<PDB:1RRP>) [3].  Like  the  WASP  domain,  RanBD1  show a PH domain fold (see
<PDOC50003>), although  there  is  no  detectable sequence similarity. Ran-GTP
contacts RanBD1   in   four   different   points,   "embracing"  RanBD1.  This
conformation can stabilize the binding of GTP to Ran.

The following proteins contain a RanBD1 domain:

 - Mammalian  Ran  binding  protein  1.  RanBP1 is a small  cytosolic protein,
   essential for nuclear import and export of RNA.
 - Mammalian Ran binding protein 2. RanBP2 is a filamentous protein located in
   the  Nuclear  Pore  Complex  (NPC) on the  cytoplasmic side of the ring. It
   could function in coupling  RanGTP hydrolysis to NPC translocation  through
   its Ran binding domain.
 - Mammalian  Ran  binding  protein  3  proteins.  RanBP3  is localized in the
   nucleus  and preferentially bind RanGTP and may be nuclear effectors of the
   Ran pathway.
 - Yeast  nucleoporin  2  (NUP2).  NUP2  is  a  component  of the nuclear pore
   complex. It may be involved in binding and translocation of proteins during
   nucleocytoplasmic transport.
 - Mammalian nucleoporin NUP50.

The profile we developed covers the entire RanBD1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
