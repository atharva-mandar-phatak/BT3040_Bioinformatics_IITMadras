* LDL-receptor class A (LDLRA) domain signature and profile *
*************************************************************

Low-density lipoprotein  (LDL)  receptors  are the major  cholesterol-carrying
lipoproteins of  plasma.  Seven  successive  cysteine-rich repeats of about 40
amino acids are present in the N-terminal of this multidomain membrane protein
[1]. Similar  domains  have  been  found  (see  references  in  [2])  in other
extracellular and membrane proteins which are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  very low  density  lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, which binds and
   transports VLDL.   Its extracellular domain is composed of 8 LDLRA domains,
   3 EGF-like domains and 6 LDL-receptor class B domains (LDLRB).
 - Vertebrate  low-density   lipoprotein  receptor-related  protein  1  (LRP1)
   (reviewed in [3]),  which  may  act  as  a  receptor for the endocytosis of
   extracellular ligands. LRP1  contains  31  LDLRA  domains  and  22 EGF-like
   domains.
 - Vertebrate  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2) (also
   known as  gp330 or megalin). LRP2 contains 36 LDLRA domains and 17 EGF-like
   domains.
 - A  LRP-homolog from Caenorhabditis elegans, which contains 35 LDLRA domains
   and 17 EGF-like domains.
 - Drosophila  putative vitellogenin receptor, with 13 copies of LDLRA domains
   and 17 EGF-like repeats.
 - Complement factor  I, which is responsible for cleaving the alpha-chains of
   C4b and C3b. It consists of a FIMAC domain (Factor I/MAC proteins C6/C7), a
   scavenger receptor-like domain,  2  copies of LDLRA and a C-terminal serine
   protease domain.
 - Complement  components  C6,  C7,  C8  and  C9.  They contain each one LDLRA
   domain.
 - Perlecan,   a   large   multidomain   basement   membrane  heparan  sulfate
   proteoglycan composed  of  4 LDLRA domains, 3 LamB domains, 12 laminin EGF-
   like domains,  14-21  IG-like  domains,  3  LamG  domains,  and  4 EGF-like
   domains. A   similar   but   shorter   proteoglycan  (UNC52)  is  found  in
   Caenorhabditis elegans which has 3 repeats of LDLRA.
 - Invertebrate  giant  extracellular  hemoglobin  linker  chains, which allow
   heme-containing chains to construct giant hemoglobin (1 LDLRA domain).
 - G-protein  coupled  receptor  Grl101  of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, which
   might directly transduce signals carried by large extracellular proteins.
 - Vertebrate  enterokinase  (EC  3.4.21.9), a type II membrane protein of the
   intestinal brush  border, which activates trypsinogen. It consists at least
   of a catalytic light chain and a multidomain heavy chain which has 2 LDLRA,
   a MAM  domain  (see <PDOC00604>), a SRCR domain (see <PDOC00348>) and a CUB
   domain (see <PDOC00908>).
 - Human  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease protein 1 (PKD1), which
   is involved    in   adhesive   protein-protein   and   protein-carbohydrate
   interactions. The potential calcium-binding site of its single LDLRA domain
   is missing.
 - Vertebrate    integral   membrane   protein DGCR2/IDD, a potential adhesion
   receptor with  1 LDLRA  domain,  a  C-type  lectin  and  a VWFC domain (see
   <PDOC00928>).
 - Drosophila  serine protease  nudel  (EC 3.4.21.-), which is involved in the
   induction of  dorsoventral polarity of the embryo. It has 11 LDLRA domains,
   3 of which miss the first disulfide bond (C1-C3).
 - Avian subgroup A rous sarcoma virus receptor (1 copy of LDLRA).
 - Bovine  Sco-spondin,  which  is  secreted  by  the  subcommissural organ in
   embryos and  is  involved  in  the  modulation  of neuronal aggregation. It
   contains at least 2 EGF-like domains and 3 LDLRA domains.

The LDL-receptor class A domain contains 6 disulfide-bound cysteines [4] and a
highly conserved  cluster of negatively charged amino acids, of which many are
clustered  on one  face  of the module [2]. A schematic representation of this
domain is shown here:

'x': any residue.
'*': position of the pattern.

In LDL-receptors  the  class  A  domains form the binding site for LDL [1] and
calcium [5].  The  acidic  residues between the fourth and sixth cysteines are
important for  high-affinity binding of positively charged sequences in LDLR's
ligands [6].  The  repeat  has  been  shown  [2]  to consist of a beta-hairpin
structure  followed by a series of beta turns. The binding of calcium seems to
induce no significant conformational change.
