***************************************

The Src  homology  2  (SH2) domain is a protein domain of about 100 amino-acid
residues first   identified   as  a  conserved  sequence  region  between  the
oncoproteins Src and Fps [1]. Similar sequences were later found in many other
intracellular signal-transducing   proteins   [2].  SH2  domains  function  as
regulatory modules  of  intracellular  signalling cascades by interacting with
high affinity  to  phosphotyrosine-containing  target  peptides in a sequence-
specific and strictly phosphorylation-dependent manner [3,4,5,6].

The SH2  domain  has  a conserved 3D structure consisting of two alpha helices
and six  to  seven  beta-strands.  The  core  of  the  domain  is  formed by a
continuous beta-meander composed of two connected beta-sheets [7].

So far, SH2 domains have been identified in the following proteins:

 - Many  vertebrate,  invertebrate  and  retroviral cytoplasmic (non-receptor)
   protein tyrosine kinases. In particular in the Src, Abl, Bkt, Csk and ZAP70
   families of kinases.
 - Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C gamma-1 and -2. Two
   copies of  the  SH2  domain  are  found  in  those  proteins in between the
   catalytic 'X-' and 'Y-boxes' (see <PDOC50007>).
 - Mammalian phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit.
 - Some vertebrate and invertebrate protein-tyrosine phosphatases.
 - Mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP).
 - Adaptor  proteins  mediating binding of guanine nucleotide exchange factors
   to growth  factor  receptors: vertebrate GRB2, Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5
   and Drosophila DRK.
 - Mammalian  Vav  oncoprotein,  a  guanine-nucleotide  exchange factor of the
   CDC24 family.
 - Miscellanous   proteins   interacting   with  vertebrate  receptor  protein
   tyrosine kinases: oncoprotein Crk, mammalian cytoplasmic proteins Nck, Shc.
 - STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription).
 - Chicken tensin.
 - Yeast transcriptional control protein SPT6.

The profile developed to detect SH2 domains is based on a structural alignment
consisting of  8  gap-free  blocks  and  7  linker  regions  totaling 92 match
positions.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: protein tyrosine  kinases JAK1  and
 JAK2.
