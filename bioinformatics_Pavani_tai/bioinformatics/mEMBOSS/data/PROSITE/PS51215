**********************
* AWS domain profile *
**********************

The SET  domain  is  an evolutionarily conserved domain found predominantly in
histone methyltransferases  (HMTs)  (see  <PDOC50280>).  Not  all  SET domain-
containing proteins possess HMTase activities. The HTMase activity is probably
restricted to  a  subset of SET domain proteins as it requires the combination
of the  SET  domain  with  the  adjacent cysteine-rich regions, one located N-
terminally (pre-SET)  and the other posterior to the SET domain (post-SET). In
a subset  of SET and post-SET containing proteins, a so-called associated with
SET (AWS)  domain  is  found instead of the pre-SET domain. In addition to the
SET and  post-SET domains to which it is always associated, the AWS domain can
also be  found with PWWP (see <PDOC50812>), AT-hook, WW (see <PDOC50020>), PHD
(see <PDOC50016>) or BAH (see <PDOC51038>) [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain an AWS domain are listed below:

 - Yeast set-2 protein.
 - Human huntingtin-interacting protein B (HYPB).

The profile we developed covers the entire AWS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
