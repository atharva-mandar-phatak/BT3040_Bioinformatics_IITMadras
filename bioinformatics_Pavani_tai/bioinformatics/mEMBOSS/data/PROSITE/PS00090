***************************************************************

Nitrogenase (EC 1.18.6.1) [1] is  the enzyme system responsible for biological
nitrogen fixation.  Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two
components:  component 2  is  an  homodimer  of  an iron-sulfur protein, while
component 1  which  contains  the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to
ammonia exists in three different forms:

 - A molybdenum-iron containing protein (MoFe). The MoFe protein is a  hetero-
   tetramer consisting of two pairs of alpha (nifD) and beta (nifK) subunits.
 - A vanadium-iron containing protein (VFe).   The VFe protein is a hexamer of
   two pairs each of alpha (vnfD), beta (vnfK), and delta (vnfG) subunits.
 - The third form of component 1 seems to only contain iron. Like the vanadium
   form it  is  a  hexamer  composed  of  alpha (anfD), beta (anfK), and delta
   (anfG) subunits.

The alpha and  beta  chains of the three types of component 1 are evolutionary
related and they are  also  related to proteins  nifE and nifN, which are most
probably involved in the iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis [2].

We selected as signature patterns for this family of proteins two stretches of
residues which are located  in the N-terminal section and which each contain a
conserved cysteine  thought  to  be  one  of  the ligands for the metal-sulfur
clusters.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYH]-[LIVMFST]-H-[AG]-[AGSP]-[LIVMNQA]-[AG]-C
                    [C may be an iron-sulfur ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Anabaena PCC 7120 and Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus nifK  which have
 Gln instead of the conserved His.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Consensus pattern: [STANQ]-[ET]-C-x(5)-G-D-[DN]-[LIVMT]-x-[STAGR]-[LIVMFYST]
                    [C may be an iron-sulfur ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for nifN proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
