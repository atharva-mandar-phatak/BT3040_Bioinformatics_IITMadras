***********************
* ENTH domain profile *
***********************

The epsin NH2-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is a membrane interacting module
of ~140  amino  acids.  Typically it is located within 20 residues of the NH2-
terminus of  proteins  that  often  contain consensus sequences for binding to
clathrin coat  components  and their accessory factors, and therefore function
as endocytic  adaptors.  ENTH domain containing proteins have additional roles
in signaling  and  actin  regulation  and  may  have  yet other actions in the
nucleus. The  ENTH  domain  is found associated with other domains such as UIM
(see <PDOC50330>),  the  EH  domain  binding motif NPF, the DPW/F motif or the
I/LWEQ domain. The ENTH domain has been shown to bind to phosphoinositides, as
well as  to  interact with proteins, such as the transcription factor PLZF and
tubulin [1,2,3,4].

The ENTH  domain  forms a compact globular structure, composed of eight alpha-
helices connected  by  loops  of  varying length (see <PDB:1EDU>). The general
topology of  the  domain  is  determined  by  three  helical hairpins that are
stacked consecutively  with  a  right  handed twist. The most highly conserved
amino acids  fall  roughly  into  two  classes: (i) internal residues that are
involved in  packing and therefore are necessary for structural integrity, and
(ii) solvent  accessible  residues  that  may  be  involved in protein-protein
interactions. The  ENTH  domain is structurally similar to the VHS domain (see
<PDOC50179>) [4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a ENTH domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian epsin 1, 2 and 3 and their yeast homologs Ent1 through Ent4.
 - Drosophila liquid facets (LqF), an epsin ortholog.
 - Mammalian  AP180,  a  third  major component of neuronal endocytic clathrin
   coats besides clathrin and AP-2.
 - Mammalian CALM, the non-neuronal homolog of AP180.
 - Yeast yAP180A and yAP180B, two AP180 homologs.
 - Mammalian  HIP1  and HIP1R. so called because of their property to interact
   with huntingtin  (huntingtin interacting protein and huntingtin interacting
   protein related, respectively), the Huntington disease protein.
 - Yeast Sla2, the homolog of HIP1/HIP1R.

The profile we developed spans the entire ENTH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
