* Ribosomal protein L6 signatures *
***********************************

Ribosomal protein L6 is one of  the proteins from the large ribosomal subunit.
In  Escherichia coli,  L6    is  known to bind directly to the 23S rRNA and is
located  at the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of the peptidyltransferase center.
It belongs to a family  of ribosomal  proteins which, on the basis of sequence
similarities [1,2,3,4], groups:

 - Eubacterial L6.
 - Algal chloroplast L6.
 - Cyanelle L6.
 - Archaebacterial L6.
 - Marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial L6.
 - Yeast mitochondrial YmL6 (gene MRPL6).
 - Mammalian L9.
 - Drosophila L9.
 - Plants L9.
 - Yeast L9 (YL11).

While all the above proteins are evolutionary related  it is very difficult to
derive a pattern that will find them all.   We therefore decided to create two
patterns, the first to detect eubacterial, cyanelle and  mitochondrial L6, the
second to detect archaebacterial L6 as well as eukaryotic L9.

-Consensus pattern: [PS]-[DENS]-x-Y-K-[GA]-K-G-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [QLS]-x(3)-[LIVM]-x(2)-[KRWYF]-x(2)-R-x-F-x-D-G-[LIVM]-
                    [YF]-[LIVM]-x(2)-[KR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
