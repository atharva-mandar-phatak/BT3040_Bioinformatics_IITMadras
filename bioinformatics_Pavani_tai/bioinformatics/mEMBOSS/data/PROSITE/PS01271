* Sodium:sulfate symporter family signature *
*********************************************

Integral membrane  proteins  that  mediate  the  intake  of  a wide variety of
molecules with  the  concomitant uptake of sodium ions (sodium symporters) can
be grouped, on the basis of sequence and functional similarities into a number
of distinct  families.  One  of  these  families  currently  consists  of  the
following proteins:

 - Mammalian sodium/sulfate cotransporter [1].
 - Mammalian  renal  sodium/dicarboxylate  cotransporter [2], which transports
   succinate and citrate.
 - Mammalian intestinal sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter.
 - Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  putative  sulfur deprivation response regulator
   SAC1 [3].
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans hypothetical proteins B0285.6, F31F6.6, K08E5.2 and
   R107.1.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfbS.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0608.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein sll0640.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0672.

These transporters  are  proteins of  from 430 to 620  amino acids  which  are
highly hydrophobic and which probably contain  about 12 transmembrane regions.
As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region which is located in or
near the penultimate transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: [STACPI]-S-x(2)-[FY]-x(2)-P-[LIVM]-[GSA]-x(3)-N-x-[LIVM]-V
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
