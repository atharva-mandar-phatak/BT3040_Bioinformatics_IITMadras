* Aldo/keto reductase family signatures *
*****************************************

The aldo-keto reductase family [1,2] groups together a number of  structurally
and functionally related NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases as well as some other
proteins. The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2).
 - Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21).
 - 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.1.50),  which  terminates
   androgen  action  by  converting  5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone  to  3-alpha-
   androstanediol.
 - Prostaglandin F synthase (EC 1.1.1.188) which   catalyzes  the reduction of
   prostaglandins H2 and D2 to F2-alpha.
 - D-sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.200) from apple.
 - Morphine  6-dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.218)  from Pseudomonas putida plasmid
   pMDH7.2 (gene morA).
 - Chlordecone   reductase   (EC   1.1.1.225)   which  reduces  the  pesticide
   chlordecone (kepone) to the corresponding alcohol.
 - 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid  reductase   (EC 1.1.1.274) which catalyzes  the
   reduction  of 2,5-diketogluconic  acid  to  2-keto-L-gulonic  acid,  a  key
   intermediate in the production of ascorbic acid.
 - NAD(P)H-dependent  xylose  reductase  (EC  1.1.1.-)  from  the yeast Pichia
   stipitis. This enzyme reduces xylose into xylit.
 - Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.20).
 - 3-oxo-5-beta-steroid  4-dehydrogenase  (EC  1.3.99.6)  which  catalyzes the
   reduction of delta(4)-3-oxosteroids.
 - A soybean reductase, which co-acts with chalcone synthase  in the formation
   of 4,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone.
 - Frog eye lens rho crystallin.
 - Yeast GCY protein, whose function is not known.
 - Leishmania  major P110/11E protein. P110/11E is a developmentally regulated
   protein whose abundance is markedly elevated in promastigotes compared with
   amastigotes. Its exact function is not yet known.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yafB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yghE.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR149w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR104w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR096w.

These proteins have all about 300 amino acid residues.  We derived 3 consensus
patterns specific to this family of proteins.  The first one is located in the
N-terminal section of these  proteins.  The  second  pattern is located in the
central section.  The third pattern, located in the C-terminal, is centered on
a  lysine  residue  whose  chemical  modification,  in   aldose  and  aldehyde
reductases, affect the catalytic efficiency.

-Consensus pattern: G-[FY]-R-[HSAL]-[LIVMF]-D-[STAGCL]-[AS]-x(5)-[EQ]-x(2)-
                    [LIVMCA]-[GS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY]-x(8)-{L}-[KREQ]-{K}-[LIVM]-G-[LIVM]-[SC]-N-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for morA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[PAIV]-[KR]-[ST]-{EPQG}-{RFI}-x(2)-R-{SVAF}-x-
                    [GSTAEQK]-[NSL]-x-{LVRI}-[LIVMFA]
                    [K may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for yafB.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 41.

-Last update: April 2006 / Patterns revised.
