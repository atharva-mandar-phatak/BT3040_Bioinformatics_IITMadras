* Endothelin family signature *
*******************************

Endothelins (ET's) are a family  of  potent mammalian vasoconstrictor peptides
[1,2,3]. Sarafotoxins (SRTX) and bibrotoxin (BTX) are  cardiotoxins  from  the
venom of snakes of the Atractaspis family, structurally and functionally [4,5]
similar to  endothelin.  The  peptides  currently  known  to  belonging to the
ET/SRTX family are:

 - Endothelin 1 (ET-1).
 - Endothelin 2 (ET-2) which  is  also known in mouse as Vasoactive Intestinal
   Contractor (VIC).
 - Endothelin 3 (ET-3).
 - Sarafotoxins SRTX-A, -B, -C and -D from Atractaspis engaddensis.
 - Bibrotoxin (BTX) from Atractaspis bibroni.

As shown in the  following schematic  representation, these peptides which are
21 residues long contain two intramolecular disulfide bonds.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

As a  signature  pattern  for  this  family  of  proteins,  we  have taken the
conserved residues in the disulfide loops region.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-C-x(4)-D-x(2)-C-x(2)-[FY]-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In addition to endothelin, the precursors of ETs contain an endothelin-
 like domain which is also detected by this pattern.
-Note: The precursor of sarafotoxins is  a  large  protein  that  contains  12
 copies of various isoforms of the toxin [6].
