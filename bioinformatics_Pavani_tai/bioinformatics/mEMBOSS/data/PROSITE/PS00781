************************************************

Phosphoenolpyruvate  carboxylase   (EC 4.1.1.31)   (PEPcase)   catalyzes   the
irreversible beta-carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate by bicarbonate to yield
oxaloacetate and phosphate. The enzyme is found in all plants and in a variety
of microorganisms.  A histidine [1]  and a lysine [2] have  been implicated in
the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme;  the  regions around these active site
residues are highly conserved  in PEPcase  from  various  plants, bacteria and
cyanobacteria and can be used as a signature patterns for this type of enzyme.

-Consensus pattern: [VTI]-x-T-A-H-P-T-[EQ]-x(2)-R-[KRHAQ]
                    [H is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [IVLC]-M-[LIVM]-G-Y-S-D-S-x-K-[DF]-[STAG]-G
                    [K is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
