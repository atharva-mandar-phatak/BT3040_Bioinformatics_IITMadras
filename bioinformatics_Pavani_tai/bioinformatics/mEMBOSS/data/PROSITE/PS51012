* ABC transporter integral membrane type-2 domain profile *
***********************************************************

ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
uses  the  hydrolysis  of ATP to energize diverse biological import and export
systems.  ABC transporters are minimally constituted of two conserved regions:
a  highly  conserved  ATP  binding cassette (ABC) (see <PDOC00185>) and a less
conserved  transmembrane  domain (TMD). These regions can be found on the same
protein  (mostly  in  eukaryotes  and bacterial exporters) or on two different
ones (mostly bacterial importers) [1,2,3]. But in a subgroup of exporters, the
transmembrane  region  is  encoded  by a separated polypeptide, the ABC-2 type
transport  system  integral  membrane  protein.  The  molecular  size  of this
transmembrane  protein  is  around  30  Kd.  It  is  thought  to  contain  six
transmembrane  regions,  it  either  form homooligomeric channels or associate
with  another  type  of  transmembrane  protein  to  form  heteroligomers. The
function  of  the  integral  inner-membrane  protein  is  to  translocate  the
substrate across the membrane and seems to play an important role in substrate
recognition [4].

The  ABC-2  type transport system integral membrane proteins with a functional
attribution are listed below:

 - Escherichia coli wzm (kpsM), involved in polysialic acid export.
 - Haemophilus  influenzae  bexB,  involved  in  polyribosylribitol  phosphate
   capsule polysaccharide export.
 - Neisseria  meningitidis  ctrC,  involved  in  polyneuraminic  acid  capsule
   polysaccharide export.
 - Rhizobiacae   nodulation  protein  J  (gene  nodJ),  probably  involved  in
   exporting a modified beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide.
 - Streptomyces   peucetius   drrB,  involved  in  exporting  the  antibiotics
   daunorubicin and Doxorubicin.
 - Klebsiella pneumoniae O-antigen export system protein rfbA.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica O-antigen export system protein rfbD.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yadH.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhhJ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhih.

The  profile  we  developed  recognize  the  six transmembrane regions of ABC-2
integral membrane proteins.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL, except 1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  profile  replaces   a  pattern  (PS00890)  whose specificity was
 inadequate. Furthermore, this profile matches some eukaryotic transporters in
 Drosophila  melanogaster,  Dictyostelium  discoideum,  Anopheles gambiae, and
 some prokaryotic fused exporters. None of these atypical matches are detected
 by other ABC TMD profiles (see <PDOC00364>).
