* SCA7 domain profile *
***********************

SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5  acetyltransferase),  a  coactivator  complex  involved  in
chromatin remodelling,  harbours both histone acetylation and deubiquitination
activities. ATXN7/Sgf73 and ATXN7L3, two subunits of the SAGA deubiquitination
module, contain  an ~50-residue SCA7 domain characterized by an atypical zinc-
finger (ZnF)   with   a   Cys-X(9,10)-Cys-X(5)-Cys-X(2)-His  motif,  which  is
characterized by  a  long  sequence  insertion    between  the  first two zinc
coordinating residues.  The SCA7 domain is found exclusively in members of the
ATXN7 gene  family,  which  includes  two distinct subunits of SAGA complexes:
ATXN7 and  ATXN7L3 orthologues. The analysis of multiple alignments highlights
the consensus  signature  for the SCA7 domain, encompassing the putative zinc-
coordinating residues,  but  also  reveals  the  distinct  features of the two
proteins. Marked  differences  are found mostly in the carboxy-terminal of the
domain, suggesting  that divergent evolution of the SCA7 Znf domain occured in
order to  achieve  specific  functions  in the SAGA complex. Both SCA7 domains
contain disordered  regions,  albeit not in the same region. Whereas the first
and last  10  residues  of  ATXN7-SCA7 (see <PDB:2KKR>) are not folded, the N-
terminal region  of  ATXN7L3-SCA7  (see <PDB:2KKT>) is well structured and the
last 30  residues  of  this  domain  are  not  folded.  In both ATXN7-SCA7 and
ATXN7L3-SCA7, the  large sequence insertion between the first and second zinc-
coordinating cysteines corresponds to a protruding extended hairpin structure.
The core  of  the zinc-binding sites shows a conserved structure formed by two
short adjacent  loops  located at the bottom of the hairpin. Although the SCA7
domains of  both  ATXN7  and  ATXN7L3 contain two alpha-helices, these are not
located at  similar  positions in the sequences. In ATXN7-SCA7, the two alpha-
helices are located downstream from the zinc-binding site and are separated by
a loop  containing a large number of positively charged  residues. In ATXN7L3-
SCA7, the  two helices lie to either side of the zinc-binding site, leading to
a different packing of the two helices. In ATXN7–SCA7, the two helices have an
almost perpendicular orientation, the alpha2 helix being anchored to the zinc-
binding site.  In  ATXN7L3–SCA7,  the helices alpha1 and alpha2 adopt an anti-
parallel orientation  defined  by  hydrophobic  interactions.  The  ATXN7-SCA7
domain binds  to  the  core  or the C-terminal ends of the histone H2A and H2B
dimer, a  region  located  on the lateral face of the nucleosome that contains
the ubiquitinated  Lys  120  of  H2B.  This property is lost in the ATXN7-SCA7
domain [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire SCA7 domain.
