* Bacterial-type phytoene dehydrogenase signature *
***************************************************

Phytoene dehydrogenase  (phytoene  desaturase)  is  an  enzyme  of  carotenoid
biosynthesis that  converts  phytoene  into  zeta-carotene via the symmetrical
introduction of  two double bonds at the C-11 and C-11' positions of phytoene.
The sequence  of  phytoene dehydrogenase from bacteria (gene crtI or carC) and
fungi (gene AL-1) are not related to that from cyanobacteria and plants but is
evolutionary related [1] to that of another enzyme of carotenoid biosynthesis,
methoxyneurosporene dehydrogenase (gene crtD).

There are  two  glycine-rich  conserved regions, both of which probably play a
role in the binding of either FAD or NAD. The first conserved region is in the
N-terminal section  while the second one is in the C-terminal section. We have
used the second region as a signature pattern.
