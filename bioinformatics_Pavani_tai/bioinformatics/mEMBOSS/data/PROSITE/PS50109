* Histidine kinase domain profile *
***********************************

Most prokaryotic signal-transduction systems and a few eukaryotic pathways use
phosphotransfer schemes   involving  two  conserved  components,  a  histidine
protein kinase  (HK)  and a response regulator protein (RR) (see <PDOC50110>).
The HK,  which  is regulated by environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a
histidine residue,   creating   a   high-energy   phosphoryl   group  that  is
subsequently transferred      to  an  aspartate  residue  in  the  RR  domain.
Phosphorylation induces    a  conformational  change  in  RR  that  results in
activation of an associated domain that effects the response.

Both prokaryotic   and   eukaryotic  HKs  contain  the  same  basic  signaling
components, namely a diverse sensing domain and a highly conserved kinase core
that has  a  unique  fold,  distinct  from  that  of  the  Ser/Thr/Tyr  kinase
superfamily. The  overall activity of the kinase is modulated by input signals
to the  sensing  domain. HKs undergo an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation at a
conserved His residue in the kinase core. Autophosphorylation is a bimolecular
reaction between   homodimers,   in   which   one  HK  monomer  catalyzes  the
phosphorylation of the conserved His residue in the second monomer.

The sensing domains are variable in sequence, reflective of the many different
environmental signals  to  which  HKs  are  responsive, whereas the about 250-
residue kinase  core  is  more  conserved.  The  kinase  core is composed of a
dimerization domain and an ATP/ADP-binding phosphotransfer or catalytic domain
and can  be  identified  by  five conserved primary sequence motifs present in
both eukaryotic  and  procaryotic HKs. These motifs have been termed the H, N,
G1, F  and G2 boxes. The conserved His substrate is the central feature in the
H box,  whereas the N, G1, F and G2 boxes define the nucleotide binding cleft.
In most  HKs,  the H box is part of the dimerization domain. However, for some
proteins, like CheA, the conserved His is located at the far N-terminus of the
protein in  a  separate  HPt  domain.  The  N,  G1, F and G2 boxes are usually
contiguous, but  the  spacing  between  these  motifs  is somewhat varied. The
catalytic core  forms  an  alpha-beta sandwich consisting of five antiparallel
beta strands and three alpha helices (see <PDB:1BXD>) [1,2,3].

The profile we developed covers the histidine kinase core.
