* Glycosyl hydrolases family 11 active sites signatures *
*********************************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family G [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 11  [4,E1].    The  enzymes which are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Aspergillus awamori xylanase C (xynC).
 - Bacillus  circulans,  pumilus,  stearothermophilus  and  subtilis  xylanase
   (xynA).
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum xylanase (xynB).
 - Clostridium stercorarium xylanase A (xynA).
 - Fibrobacter  succinogenes  xylanase C (xynC) which consist of two catalytic
   domains that both belong to family 10.
 - Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase A (xynA).
 - Ruminococcus flavefaciens bifunctional xylanase XYLA (xynA).  This  protein
   consists of  three  domains: a N-terminal xylanase  catalytic  domain  that
   belongs to family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases; a  central domain  composed of
   short repeats  of Gln, Asn an Trp,  and  a  C-terminal  xylanase  catalytic
   domain that belongs to family 10 of glycosyl hydrolases.
 - Schizophyllum commune xylanase A.
 - Streptomyces lividans xylanases B (xlnB) and C (xlnC).
 - Trichoderma reesei xylanases I and II.

Two of the conserved regions in  these enzymes  are  centered on glutamic acid
residues which have both  been shown [5], in Bacillus pumilis xylanase,  to be
necessary  for  catalytic activity.  We  have  used  both regions as signature
patterns.

-Consensus pattern: [PSA]-[LQ]-x-E-[YF]-Y-[LIVM](2)-[DE]-x-[FYWHN]
                    [E is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Piromyces sp. xynA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-x(2)-E-[AG]-[YWG]-[QRFGS]-[SG]-[STAN]-G-x-[SAF]
                    [E is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Piromyces sp. xynA.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.
