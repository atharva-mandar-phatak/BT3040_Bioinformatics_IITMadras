Vitamin  B12  (cobalamin)  is an essential nutrient that serves as a co-factor
for  enzymatic  reactions.  The  biosynthesis  of  this  coenzyme is a complex
process  that  is  confined  to  certain  prokaryotes  and  requires  circa 25
different enzymes. During the assembly, six amide groups are introduced at the
a,  b,  c,  d, e and g carboxylates. In the aerobic and anaerobic biosynthetic
pathways,  the  six  amidation  steps are carried out by two seperate enzymes.
Cobyrinic  acid a,c-diamide synthethase (cbiA and cobB) is responsible for the
introduction  of  the  two  amide  groups  at  the a and c positions in either
cobyrinic  acid  or  hydrogenobrynic acid. The amidation of the b, d, e, and g
carboxylate  groups  in adenosyl-Cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide is catalyzed by
cobyric  acid  synthetase (cbiP and cobQ). Many of the enzymatic reactions for
the aerobic biosynthesis of cobalamin are known for Pseudomonas denitrificans.
The  anaerobic  pathway  is  found  in  other  bacteria  and  archaea, such as
Salmonella  typhimurium,  Bacillus  megaterium,  Methanococcus  jannaschii and
Propionibacterium freudenreichii [1].

The  cobB  and  cobQ  family proteins contain two separate domains involved in
cobalamin  biosynthesis, i.e. a synthetase domain including ATP-binding motifs
in the N-terminal part and a glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domain in the
C-terminal   part.  The  GATase  domain  is  involved  in  glutamine  binding,
hydrolysis  and  transfer of the resulting ammonia to an acceptor. This domain
resembles  the  GATases  of  class  I,  which are characterized by a conserved
Cys-His-Glu active site (see <PDOC00405>), but the cobBQ-type GATases lack the
Glu  residue  in this typical triad [2, 3]. The cobBQ-type GATase domain shows
also similarity to other GATase type 1 related domains/families, like PdxT/SNO
(see   <PDOC00950>),  gamma-glutamyl  hydrolase  (see  <PDOC51275>)  and  PfpI
endopeptidase (see <PDOC51276>).

Some proteins known to contain a cobBQ-type GATase domain:

 - Salmonella typhimurium cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (cbiA), which is
   responsible  for the amidation of carboxylic groups at positions a and c of
   either cobyrinic acid or hydrogenobrynic acid.
 - Pseudomonas denitrificans cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (cobB), which
   is  responsible for the amidation of carboxylic groups at positions a and c
   of either cobyrinic acid or hydrogenobrynic acid.
 - Salmonella  typhimurium  cobyric  acid  synthase  (cbiP),  which  catalyzes
   amidations at positions b, d, e, and g on adenosylcobyrinic a,c-diamide.
 - Pseudomonas  denitrificans  cobyric  acid  synthase (cobQ), which catalyzes
   amidations at positions b, d, e, and g on adenosylcobyrinic a,c-diamide.

The profile we developed covers the entire cobBQ-type GATase domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The cobBQ-type GATase domain profile is in competition with profiles of
 related  domains,  which include GATase type 1 (see <PDOC00405>) and pdxT/SNO
 (see <PDOC00950>).
