* SURP motif repeat profile *
*****************************

The SURP  motif  is an about 40-residue module, which has been named after the
first proteins containing it (suppressor-of-white-apricot and PRP21/SPP91). It
is found  tandemly  repeated  in  proteins  involved in either constitutive or
regulated pre-mRNA  splicing.  Overall,  the N-terminal half of the SURP motif
exhibits a   higher  conservation  than  the  C-terminal  half,  where  length
differences are  apparent in addition to sequence heterogeneity. Nevertheless,
within this  region, the motif F-x-F-L and the dipeptide Y-Y at the C-terminal
border are conserved in nearly all proteins. The function of the SURP motif is
still unknown [1,2,3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a SURP motif are listed below:

 - Drosophila suppressor-of-white-apricot (su(wa)) protein. It modulates a
   specific set of somatic, sex-independent pre-mRNA processing events.
 - Yeast PRP21/SPP91, a constitutive pre-mRNA splicing factor.
 - Vertebrate SWAP proteins, which are homologs of the su(wa) protein.
 - Mammalian SF3a120 splicing factor, the homolog of PRP21/SPP91.

The profile we developed covers the entire SURP motif.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
