* ZU5 domain profile *
**********************

The  ZU5  domain  is  a  domain of 90-110 residues present in zona occludens 1
(ZO-1)  protein, in unc5-like netrin receptors and in ankyrins. The ZU5 domain
is  named  after  the  mouse  tight  junction  protein ZO-1 and the C. elegans
uncoordinated  protein  5  (unc-5) and related Unc5-like netrin receptors. ZU5
domains  are  found  in  eukaryotic  proteins  that  in  most  cases contain a
C-terminal  death  domain  (see <PDOC50017>). Other domains which can be found
N-terminal to a ZU5 domain are ankyrin repeats (see <PDOC50088>); Ig-like (see
<PDOC50835>)  and  TSP1  repeats (see <PDOC50092>); PDZ (see <PDOC50106>), SH3
(see  <PDOC50002>)  and  guanylate  kinase  (see <PDOC00670>); or leucine-rich
repeats  (LRR) [1-4]. The ZU5 domain can function as a spectrin-binding domain
in  ankyrins  [5],  and  participates in induction of apoptosis and binding of
melanoma-associated antigen D1 (MAGE-D1/NRAGE) in UNC5H1-3 [6].

Some proteins known to contain a ZU5 domain:

 - Mammalian zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) or tight junction ZO1 protein, implicated
   in  junction  formation.  ZO-1 belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate
   kinase (MAGUK) proteins (see <PDOC00670>).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  unc-5,  a receptor for netrin (unc-6) required for
   axon  repulsion.
 - Vertebrate  Unc5  homologues  (UNC5H1-4), which are axon guidance receptors
   that  mediate  netrin-1-dependent  chemorepulsion,  and  are receptors that
   mediate netrin-1-independent apoptosis.
 - Mammalian  ankyrins  1-3,  which  attach  the  cytoskeleton  to  the plasma
   membrane  and  organize  diverse  membrane-spanning  proteins,  such as ion
   channels and transporters.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  unc-44,  an  ankyrin-like protein involved in axon
   guidance.
 - Mammalian  PIDD  (p53-induced protein with a death domain) or LRDD (leucine
   rich  repeat and death domain containing protein), a regulator of apoptosis
   in response to genotoxic stimuli [4]. PIDD contains two ZU5 domains.

The profile we developed covers the entire ZU5 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The ZU5 domain is also known as ZU-5 domain.
