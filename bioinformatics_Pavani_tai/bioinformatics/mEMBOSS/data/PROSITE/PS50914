* BON domain profile *
**********************

The BON  (bacterial  OsmY  and  nodulation)  domain  is found in the bacterial
osmotic-shock-resistance protein  OsmY,  a  family  of haemolysins, a group of
nodulation specificity   proteins   and   secretory   channels,   and  several
hypothetical proteins.  It  is  typically  about  60  residues long and has an
alpha/beta predicted  fold.  There  is a conserved glycine residue and several
hydrophobic regions.  The  BON  domain  can be found in one or more copies and
associated with other domains, such as CBS, LysM or FHA (see <PDOC50006>). The
BON domain  is  likely to be a phospholipid-binding domain that is involved in
osmotic-shock protection and other cell-membrane-localized processes [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire BON domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: August 2003 / First entry.
