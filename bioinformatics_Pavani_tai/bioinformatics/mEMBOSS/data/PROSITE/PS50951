* SARAH domain profile *
************************

The SARAH  (for  Sav/Rassf/Hpo)  domain  is  a C-terminal eukaryotic module of
approximately 50   residues,   which  is  found  in  three  classes  of  tumor
suppressor which have given it its name.

In the  Sav  and  Hpo  families,  the  SARAH  domain  mediates  a  heterotypic
interaction that relays the signal from Hpo via the scaffolding protein Sav to
the downstream   component  Wts.  In  addition,  SARAH  domains  also  support
homotypic interactions,  as  the  human  Hpo-ortholog  Mst1  has been shown to
dimerize via its carboxy-terminal region. The SARAH domain is found associated
with other  modules,  such as the protein kinase domain (see <PDOC00100>), the
WW/rsp5/WWP domain (see <PDOC50020>), the C1 domain (see <PDOC00379>), the LIM
domain (see  <PDOC00382>) or the Ras-associating (RA) domain (see <PDOC50200>)
[1].

Secondary structure  prediction  programs  suggest a long alpha-helix spanning
most of the conserved region of the SARAH domain. The carboxy-terminal portion
of the  SARAH  domain  is  predicted  to  have  a moderate to high coiled-coil
propensity. The  SARAH domain does not contain any invariant residues, but has
several highly  conserved  positions.  While  some  of the conservation can be
explained by  generic  coiled-coil properties, other residues are specifically
conserved in  the  SARAH  family.  Regulatory  interactions mediated by coiled
coils usually   involve   relatively  short  helices  capable  of  interacting
reversibly in  a homotypic and/or heterotypic fashion. As the SARAH domain has
coiled-coil characteristics   with   an  unusual  heptad  arrangement,  it  is
conceivable that SARAH is in fact a trimerization domain [1].

Some proteins known to contain a SARAH domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila melanogaster scaffold protein salvador (Sav).
 - Mammalian salvador homolog 1 protein (SAV1).
 - Drosophila melanogaster serine/threonine protein kinase hippo (HPO).
 - Animal  Ras  association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain families of proteins (Rassf).
   These effectors  of  Ras  and Ras-related GTPases are characterized by a RA
   domain upstream of the SARAH region.

The profile we developed spans the entire SARAH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
