* Enolase signature *
*********************

Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of
2-phospho-D-glycerate to  phosphoenolpyruvate [1]. It is a dimeric enzyme that
requires magnesium both for catalysis  and   stabilizing the dimer. Enolase is
probably found in all  organisms that metabolize sugars. In vertebrates, there
are three  different  tissue-specific isozymes: alpha present in most tissues,
beta in muscles and gamma found only in nervous tissues.

Tau-crystallin,  one of  the major lens  proteins  in  some fish, reptiles and
birds, has been shown [2] to be evolutionary related to enolase.

As a  signature pattern for enolase, we selected the best conserved region, it
is located in the C-terminal third of the sequence.
