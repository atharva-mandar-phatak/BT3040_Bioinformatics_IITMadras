**********************************
* Flavodoxin-like domain profile *
**********************************

The flavodoxin-like  domain  is  an  around  170-residue  domain with a flavin
mononucleotide (FMN)-binding   site.  It  is  involved  in  electron  transfer
reactions [1,2].

Structure analyses  of several flavodoxin-like domains have shown that it is a
wound alpha-beta-alpha  fold  with  a  central 5-stranded parallel hydrophobic
beta-sheet flanked   on   either   side   by  amphipathic  alpha-helices  (see
<PDB:2FCR>) [3,4,5].  The  FMN is positioned at the tip of the C-terminal side
of the beta-sheet [3]. The fold correlates with a highly conserved, repetitive
sequence pattern  in  which  hydrophobic  residues cluster in beta-strands and
have a 3-4-residue periodicity in alpha-helices [2].

Some proteins known to contain a flavodoxin-like domain are listed below:

 - Flavodoxin,  a  low-potential  electron  donor to a number of redox enzymes
   (see <PDOC00178>).
 - Eukaryotic nitric-oxide synthase (NOS).
 - Bacterial and eukaryotic NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase.
 - Yeast protein YCP4.
 - Fission  yeast  protein P25, the target of a complex transcriptional system
   that involves  the AP-1-liker factor PAP1 as positive regulator and CRM1 as
   negative regulator.
 - Bacterial protein mioC, a probable electron transporter required for biotin
   synthase activity.
 - Bacterial protein hemG.
 - Bacterial tryptophan repressor-binding protein wrbA.
 - Bacterial    sulfite   reductase   [NADPH]   flavoprotein   alpha-component
   (EC 1.8.1.2)  (SIR-FP). It catalyzes the 6-electron reduction of sulfite to
   sulfide.

The profile we developed covers the entire flavodoxin-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
