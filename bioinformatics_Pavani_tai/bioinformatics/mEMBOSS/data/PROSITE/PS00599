* Aminotransferases class-II pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site *
******************************************************************

Aminotransferases  share certain mechanistic features with   other  pyridoxal-
phosphate dependent enzymes, such as  the  covalent  binding of the pyridoxal-
phosphate group  to  a  lysine  residue.  On the basis of sequence similarity,
these various  enzymes  can  be  grouped [1]  into subfamilies.  One of these,
called class-II, currently consists of the following enzymes:

 - Glycine C-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.29), which  catalyzes the addition of
   acetyl-CoA to glycine to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate (gene kbl).
 - 5-aminolevulinic acid  synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) (delta-ALA  synthase),  which
   catalyzes the  first  step  in  heme  biosynthesis  via  the Shemin (or C4)
   pathway, i.e.   the   addition  of  succinyl-CoA  to  glycine  to  form  5-
   aminolevulinate.
 - 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (EC 2.3.1.47) (7-KAP synthase), a bacterial
   enzyme (gene bioF) which catalyzes an intermediate step in the biosynthesis
   of biotin:  the  addition  of  6-carboxy-hexanoyl-CoA to alanine to form 8-
   amino-7-oxononanoate.
 - Histidinol-phosphate  aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.9),  which  catalyzes  the
   eighth step in histidine  biosynthetic  pathway:  the  transfer of an amino
   group from 3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate to glutamic acid to form
   histidinol phosphate and 2-oxoglutarate.
 - Serine  C-palmitoyltransferase  (EC  2.3.1.50)  from  yeast (genes LCB1 and
   LCB2), which catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form
   3-ketosphinganine.

The sequence around the pyridoxal-phosphate  attachment site  of this class of
enzyme is sufficiently conserved to allow the creation of a specific pattern.

-Consensus pattern: T-[LIVMFYW]-[STAG]-K-[SAG]-[LIVMFYWR]-[SAG]-{ENKR}-{TNDR}-
                    [SAG]
                    [K is the pyridoxal-P attachment site]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for yeast LCB1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 41.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
