* Alpha-isopropylmalate and homocitrate synthases signatures *
**************************************************************

The following enzymes have  been  shown [1] to  be  functionally  as  well  as
evolutionary related:

 - Alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (EC 2.3.3.13) which catalyzes the first step
   in the biosynthesis of leucine,  the  condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-
   ketoisovalerate to form 2-isopropylmalate synthase.
 - Homocitrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.14) (gene nifV)  which  is  involved  in the
   biosynthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor  of nitrogenase and  catalyzes
   the condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate into homocitrate.

 - Soybean late nodulin 56.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical proteins MJ0503, MJ1195 and MJ1392.

We have selected  two   conserved  regions  as  signature patterns  for  these
enzymes.  The first region  is located in  the  N-terminal section  while  the
second region is located  in the  central section  and  contains two conserved
histidine residues which could be implicated in the catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: L-R-[DE]-G-x-Q-x(4)-{L}-x(5)-K
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFW]-x(2)-H-x-H-[DN]-D-x-G-x-[GAS]-x-[GASLI]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
