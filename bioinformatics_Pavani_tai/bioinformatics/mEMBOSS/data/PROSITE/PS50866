* GOLD domain profile *
***********************

The GOLD  (for  Golgi  dynamics)  domain  is a protein module found in several
eukaryotic Golgi  and  lipid-traffic  proteins. It is typically between 90 and
150 amino  acids long. Most of the size difference observed in the GOLD-domain
superfamily is  traceable to a single large low-complexity insert that is seen
in some  versions of the domain. With the exception of the p24 proteins, which
have a simple architecture with the GOLD domain as their only globular domain,
all other  GOLD-domain proteins contain additional conserved globular domains.
In these  proteins,  the  GOLD  domain co-occurs with lipid-, sterol- or fatty
acid-binding domains   such   as   PH   (see   <PDOC50003>),   CRAL-TRIO  (see
<PDOC50191>), FYVE  (see <PDOC50178>), oxysterol binding- and acyl CoA-binding
domains, suggesting  that these proteins may interact with membranes. The GOLD
domain can also be found associated with a RUN domain (see <PDOC50826>), which
may have  a  role  in  the  interaction  of various proteins with cytoskeletal
filaments. The  GOLD  domain  is  predicted to mediate diverse protein-protein
interactions [1].

A secondary structure prediction for the GOLD domain reveals that it is likely
to adopt  a compact all-beta-fold structure with six to seven strands. Most of
the sequence  conservation  is  centered on the hydrophobic cores that support
these predicted  strands.  The  predicted secondary-structure elements and the
size of  the  conserved  core  of the domain suggests that it may form a beta-
sandwich fold  with  the  strands  arranged in two beta sheets stacked on each
other [1].

Some proteins known to contain a GOLD domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic proteins of the p24 family.
 - Animal Sec14-like proteins. They are involved in secretion.
 - Human  Golgi  resident  protein GCP60. It interacts with the Golgi integral
   membrane protein Giantin.
 - Yeast oxysterol-binding protein homolog 3 (OSH3).

The profile we developed covers the entire GOLD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
