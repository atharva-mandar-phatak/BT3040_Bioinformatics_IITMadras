* Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) N-terminal domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************************************

The insulin-like growth factors  (IGF-I and  IGF-II) bind to  specific binding
proteins in extracellular fluids with high affinity [1,2,3]. These IGF-binding
proteins (IGFBP) prolong  the half-life  of the  IGFs and have  been shown  to
either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on  cells
culture.  They  seem  to alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface
receptors. The  IGFBP  family comprises six proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6) that bind
to IGFs  with  high  affinity.  The  precursor  forms  of  all six IGFBPs have
secretory signal  peptides.  All IGFBPs share a common domain organization and
also a  high  degree  of  similarity  in  their primary protein structure. The
highest conservation  is found in the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions.
Twelve conserved  cysteines  (ten  in  IGFBP-6)  are  found  in the N-terminal
domain, and six are found in the C-terminal domain. Both the N- and C-terminal
domains participate  in  binding  to IGFs, although the specific roles each of
these domains in IGF binding have not been decisively established. In general,
the strongest  binding  to  IGFs  is shown by amino-terminal fragments, which,
however bind  to  IGF  with  10-  to 1000-fold lower affinity than full length
IGFBPs. The  central  weakly  conserved  part  (L domain) contains most of the
cleavage sites for specific proteases [4,5].

The N-terminal  domain  is  ~80 residues in length and has an L-like structure
(see <PDB:1WQJ>).  It can be divided into two subdomains that are connected by
a short  stretch  of amino acids. The two subdomains are perpendicular to each
other, creating the "L" shape for the whole N-terminal domain. The core of the
first subdomain  presents a novel fold stabilized by a short two-stranded beta
sheet and   four  disulfide  bridges  forming  a  disulfide  bond  ladder-like
structure. The  beta  sheet and disulfide bridges are all in one plane, making
the structure  appear  flat from one side like a "palm" of a hand. The palm is
extended with  a "thumb" segment in various IGFBPs. The thumb segment consists
of the  very N-terminal residues and contains a consensus XhhyC motif, where h
is a  hydrophobic amino acid and y is positively charged. The second subdomain
adopts a  globular  fold whose scaffold is secured by an inside packing of two
cysteines bridges stabilized by a three-stranded beta sheet [4,5].

The following growth-factor inducible  proteins  are  structurally  related to
IGFBPs and could function as growth-factor binding proteins [6,7]:

 - Mouse protein cyr61 and its probable chicken homolog, protein CEF-10.
 - Human connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and its mouse homolog, protein
   FISP-12.
 - Vertebrate protein NOV.

As a signature pattern we  have  used a conserved cysteine-rich region located
in the  N-terminal  IGFBP  domain. We also developed a profile that covers the
entire IGFBP N-terminal domain.
