* Renal dipeptidase family signature and profile *
**************************************************

Renal  dipeptidase  (rDP) (EC 3.4.13.19), also known as microsomal dipeptidase
or  membrane dipeptidase, is a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme which hydrolyzes a
wide  range  of  dipeptides. It is involved in renal metabolism of glutathione
and its conjugates. It is a homodimeric disulfide-linked glycoprotein attached
to the renal brush border microvilli membrane by a GPI-anchor.

The  active  site  of  rDP  is  composed  of  binuclear zinc ions bridged by a
glutamate  residue [1,2]. The two zinc ions are coordinated by three different
histidine  residues,  the  glutamate  and  an aspartate (see <PDB:1ITU>). Four
cysteine  residues form two disulfide bonds and an additional cysteine residue
in  the  C-terminal  part  links  to  the  corresponding cysteine of the other
subunit in the homodimeric enzyme.

RDP  seems  to  be  evolutionary  related  to hypothetical proteins in the PQQ
biosynthesis operons of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
We selected for a signature pattern the region around the glutamate residue in
the  active  site, which is highly conserved. We also developed a profile that
covers the entire renal dipeptidase.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-E-G-[GA]-x(2)-[LIVMF]-x(6)-L-x(3)-Y-x(2)-G-[LIVM]-R
                    [E is a zinc ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: February 2008 / Text revised; profile added.

-Note: These proteins belong to family M19 in the classification of peptidases
 [3,E1].
