* DeoR-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  deoR-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  50-60  amino  acids  present  in  transcription  regulators of the deoR
family, involved in sugar catabolism. This family of prokaryotic regulators is
named  after  Escherichia  coli  deoR,  a  repressor  of the deo operon, which
encodes  nucleotide  and  deoxyribonucleotide  catabolic  enzymes.  DeoR  also
negatively  regulates  the  expression  of nupG and tsx, a nucleoside-specific
transport protein and a channel-forming protein, respectively.

DeoR-like  transcription repressors occur in diverse bacteria as regulators of
sugar  and  nucleoside metabolic systems. The effector molecules for deoR-like
regulators   are   generally  phosphorylated  intermediates  of  the  relevant
metabolic  pathway. The DNA-binding deoR-type HTH domain occurs usually in the
N-terminal  part.  The  C-terminal part can contain an effector-binding domain
and/or  an  oligomerization domain. DeoR occurs as an octamer, whilst glpR and
agaR are tetramers. Several operators may be bound simultaneously, which could
facilitate DNA looping [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a deoR-type HTH domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  deoR,  a  transcription  repressor  of  the  operon  for
   deoxyribose metabolism. The effector is deoxyribose-5-phosphate.
 - Escherichia coli glpR, a glycerol-3-phosphate regulon repressor.
 - Lactococcus lactis lacR, a lactose phosphotransferase system repressor.
 - Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid pTiC58 accR, a transcription repressor of
   agrocinopine catabolism and conjugal transfer.
 - Escherichia  coli  agaR,  a  repressor  of the aga operon for metabolism of
   N-acetylgalactosamine  and  galactosamine [3].
 - Escherichia coli fucR, an activator of operons for L-fucose utilization.
 - Escherichia coli gatR, a repressor of the galactitol operon.
 - Escherichia coli srlR (gutR), a glucitol operon repressor.
 - Bacillus subtilis iolR, a repressor of inositol operons.

The  pattern  we  use to detect these proteins starts fourteen residues before
the  HTH motif and ends one residue after it. The profile we developed extends
seventeen  residues  upstream  and  seventeen  residues  downstream of the HTH
extremities and covers the entire deoR-type HTH DNA-binding domain.

-Consensus pattern: R-{G}-x(2)-[LIVM]-x(3)-[LIVM]-x(16,17)-[STA]-x(2)-T-
                    [LIVMA]-[RH]-[KRNAQ]-D-[LIVMF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  deoR repressor  from Bacillus subtilis, which regulates expression
 of  the  dra-nupC-pdp operon required for deoxyribonucleoside and deoxyribose
 utilization,  shows  no  sequence  similarity  to  E.  coli deoR. There is no
 similarity in the DNA operator sites either and the B. subtilis deoR does not
 possess a deoR-type HTH domain.
