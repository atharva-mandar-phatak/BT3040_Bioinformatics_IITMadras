* Bulb-type lectin domain profile *
***********************************

A bulb lectin super-family (Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae and Aliaceae) contains
a ~115-residue-long  domain  whose  overall  three  dimensional  fold  is very
similar to that of [1,2]:

 - Dictyostelium discoideum comitin, an actin binding protein,
 - Curculigo latifolia curculin, a sweet tasting and taste-modifying protein.

Although this  domain  is  a  mannose-binding lectin in the bulb super-family,
curculin is  considered  as a non-functional mannose-binding protein devoid of
mannose-binding activity [1].

Each bulb-type   lectin   domain   consists  of  three  sequential  beta-sheet
subdomains (I,  II,  III) that are inter-related by pseudo three-fold symmetry
(see <PDB:1MSA>).  The  three subdomains are flat four-stranded, antiparrallel
beta-sheets. Together  they form a 12-stranded beta-barrel in which the barrel
axis coincides with the pseudo 3-fold axis [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire bulb-type lectin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
