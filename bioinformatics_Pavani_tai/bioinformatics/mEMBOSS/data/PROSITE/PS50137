* Double stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) profile *
******************************************************

In contrast  to other RNA-binding domains, the about 65 amino acids long dsRBD
domain [1,2,3] has  been  found  in  a  number  of  proteins that specifically
recognize double-stranded  RNAs.  The  dsRBD  domain  is  also  known  as DSRM
(Double-Stranded RNA-binding  Motif).  dsRBD  proteins  are mainly involved in
posttranscriptional gene  regulation, for example by preventing the expression
of proteins  or  by  mediating RNAs localization. This domain is also found in
RNA editing proteins. Interaction of the dsRBD with RNA is unlikely to involve
the recognition of specific sequences [1,4,5,6]. Nevertheless, multiple dsRBDs
may be  able  to  act  in  combination to recognize the secondary structure of
specific RNAs  (i.e.  Staufen)  [1].  NMR  analysis  of  the  third  dsRBD  of
Drosophila Staufen have revealed an alpha-beta-beta-beta-alpha structure [7].

Some proteins known to include this domain are listed below.

 - Mammalian  double-stranded  RNA  adenosine  deaminase (DRADA) (EC 3.5.-.-),
   deaminates multiple  adenosines  to  inosines  by  a hydrolytic deamination
   reaction only  on  double-stranded  RNA;  editates  the  messenger RNAs for
   glutamate receptor (GLUR) subunits (4 times).
 - Mammalian    RNA-specific  editase  1  (RED1), edits the messenger RNAs for
   glutamate receptor (GLUR) subunits (4 times).
 - Vertebrate  TRBP,  a  protein  that  binds in vitro to the TAR stem-loop of
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA (5 times).
 - Mammalian   dsRNA-dependent   p68   kinase  (DAI, TIK)  (EC  2.7.11.1),  an
   interferon-induced protein that is involved in the cellular defense against
   viral infection.
 - Animal ATP-dependent RNA helicase A.
 - Human son protein.
 - Drosophila  maleless  protein.  It  associates  with  the  X  chromosome to
   regulate dosage  compensation.  It probably unwinds double-stranded DNA and
   RNA.
 - Drosophila  Staufen,  a  developmental  protein that associate specifically
   with Oskar  and  bicoid  mRNAs,  and  is required for their localization to
   opposite poles in the egg.
 - S.pombe  Pac-1  protein  which  digests  double  stranded-RNAs  into  short
   oligonucleotide. Identified as a suppressor of meiosis.
 - Bacterial RNase III (EC 3.1.26.3), an endonuclease that digest dsRNAs.
 - Viral  E3L, a Vaccina virus protein which inhibits the p68 kinase activity,
   maybe by competing for dsRNA.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Not  all  RNase  III  proteins  are picked-up by this motif, because of
 their high divergence.
