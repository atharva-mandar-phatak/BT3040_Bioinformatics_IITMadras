* WSC domain profile *
**********************

The  WSC  domain  is  a putative carbohydrate binding domain of about 90 amino
acids.  The  domain  is  named  after yeast WSC1-WSC4 (cell wall integrity and
stress  response  components  1-4)  proteins,  which each contain a single WSC
domain.  The  WSC  domain  can  also  be  found as more copies in tandem or in
combination  with  other  domains, such as PKD (see <PDOC50093>), LDL-receptor
class  A  (see<PDOC00929>),  C-type  lectin  (see  <PDOC00537>);  kringle (see
<PDOC00020>),  CUB (see <PDOC00908>); FN3 (see <PDOC50853>) and protein kinase
(see  <PDOC00100>).  The WSC domain contains eight conserved cysteine residues
which are predicted to form disulfide bridges [1].

Some proteins known to contain a WSC domain:

 - Mammalian  polycystin-1 (PKD1), which forms a calcium-regulated ion channel
   with  PKD2.  Defects in PKD1 are the cause of autosomal dominant polycystic
   kidney disease type I.
 - Baker's  yeast  SLG1/WSC1, WSC2 and WSC3 proteins, which may act as sensors
   of environmental stress.
 - Baker's  yeast  WSC4,  which  is implicated in protein translocation to the
   endoplasmic reticulum.
 - Mammalian  kremen (kringle-containing protein marking the eye and the nose)
   proteins 1 and 2.
 - Fruit  fly  xylosyltransferase  oxt  (EC  2.4.2.26),  which  is  the  first
   glycosyltransferase in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans xylosyltransferase sqv-6 (EC 2.4.2.26).
 - Fruit  fly  Wsck, a putative receptor with tyrosine-protein kinase activity
   (EC 2.7.10.1).
 - Trichoderma  harzianum  beta-1,3 exoglucanase, which contains 2 WSC domains
   in tandem.

The  profile we developed covers the entire WSC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
