***************************************************

Porphobilinogen deaminase  (EC  2.5.1.61), or hydroxymethylbilane synthase, is
an enzyme  involved in the biosynthesis of porphyrins and related macrocycles.
It catalyzes  the  assembly of  four  porphobilinogen (PBG) units in a head to
tail fashion to form hydroxymethylbilane.

The enzyme covalently  binds  a  dipyrromethane  cofactor  to  which  the  PBG
subunits are added in a stepwise fashion. In the Escherichia coli enzyme (gene
hemC), this  cofactor  has  been shown [1] to be bound by the sulfur atom of a
cysteine. The  region  around  this  cysteine  is conserved in porphobilinogen
deaminases from various prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.
