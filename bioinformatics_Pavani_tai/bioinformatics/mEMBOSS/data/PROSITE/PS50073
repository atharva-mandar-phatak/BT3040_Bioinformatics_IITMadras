* Copper-fist DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

Some fungal  transcription  factors  contains  a N-terminal domain which seems
to be involved in copper-dependent DNA-binding [1,2].  Such a  domain,  called
"copper-fist" seem  to  undergo a conformational change in presence of copper.
The proteins that are known to contain such a domain are:

 - Yeast ACE1 (or CUP2), which regulates the expression of the metallothionein
   gene (CUP1).
 - Candida   glabrata   AMT1,   which   also   regulates   the  expression  of
   metallothionein genes (MT-I and MT-II).
 - Yeast  MAC1  (CUA1),  a  regulator  of  the expression of the FRE1 and CTT1
   (catalase) genes.
 - Yarrowia lipolytica copper resistance protein CRF1.
 - Fission yeast metal-binding regulatory protein cuf1.
 - Fission yeast copper homeostasis protein cuf2.

The signature  pattern  we  developed  spans the complete length of the domain
and includes  three  cysteines  and  two histidines that are probably involved
in copper-binding.

-Consensus pattern: M-[LIVMFP]-[LIVMF](2)-x(3)-[KN]-[MY]-A-C-x(2)-C-[IL]-[KR]-
                    x-H-[KR]-x(3)-C-x-H-x(8,9)-[KR]-x-[KRP]-G-R-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 cuf2.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
