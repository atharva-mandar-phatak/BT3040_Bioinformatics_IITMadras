* Nebulin repeat profile *
**************************

The  nebulin-like motif or nebulin repeat is a tandemly repeated actin-binding
module of about 35 amino acids. The repeat is named after the nebulin protein,
which  is  a  large  protein  specific for vertebrate skeletal muscle that may
regulate  the  length  of thin filaments. Nebulin contains about 185 copies of
the  repeat  and  those  in  the  central  part  of nebulin are organized into
seven-module  super-repeats,  which  seems  to  reflect  an  interaction  with
tropomysin/troponin  [1].  Nebulin  repeats  occur  in  metazoan actin-binding
proteins,  most  of which are specific for muscle tissues. Most nebulin repeat
proteins contain a C-terminal SH3 domain (see <PDOC50002>) and/or a N-terminal
LIM  zinc-binding  domain  (see  <PDOC00382>).  The  repeats  in  nebulin  and
nebulette  bind  filamentous  actin  (F-actin)  and  may  also  associate with
tropomyosin  and  troponin.  The  nebulin repeat has a predicted alpha-helical
secondary structure and contains a central conserved SXXXY motif [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain nebulin repeats:

 - Vertebrate  nebulin,  which is specifically found in skeletal muscle, where
   it is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomeres.
 - Vertebrate nebulette, a nebulin-like protein that is specifically expressed
   in cardiac muscle, where it interacts with actin filaments.
 - Human  LASP-1  (LIM  and  SH3  protein-1),  a  cytoskeletal protein that is
   ubiquitously  expressed  in  most  cell  types  and  may play a role in the
   regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. LASP-1 is conserved among metazoans.
 - Mammalian  nebulin-related  anchoring  protein (NRAP), which occurs in both
   skeletal muscle and heart and appears to be involved in anchoring the actin
   filaments to the sarcolemma.

The profile we developed covers the entire nebulin repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
