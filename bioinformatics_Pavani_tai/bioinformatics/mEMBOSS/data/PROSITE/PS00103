***********************************************************

Phosphoribosyltransferases (PRT)  are  enzymes  that catalyze the synthesis of
beta-n-5'-monophosphates from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and an enzyme
specific amine.  A number of PRT's are involved in the biosynthesis of purine,
pyrimidine,  and  pyridine  nucleotides,  or  in  the  salvage of  purines and
pyrimidines. These enzymes are:

 - Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7) (APRT), which is involved in
   purine salvage.
 - Hypoxanthine-guanine or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8)
   (HGPRT or HPRT), which are involved in purine salvage.
 - Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) (OPRT), which  is  involved
   in pyrimidine biosynthesis.
 - Amido phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14), which is  involved in purine
   biosynthesis.
 - Xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.22) (XGPRT),  which is
   involved in purine salvage.

In the sequence of all these enzymes  there is a small conserved  region which
may be involved in the  enzymatic activity  and/or be part of the PRPP binding
site [1].

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYWCTA]-[LIVM]-[LIVMA]-[LIVMFC]-[DE]-D-[LIVMS]-
                    [LIVM]-[STAVD]-[STAR]-[GAC]-x-[STAR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Bacillus subtilis xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: bacterial   phosphoribosyl    pyro-
 phosphate synthases and 7 other proteins.

-Note: In position 11 of the pattern most of these enzymes have Gly.
