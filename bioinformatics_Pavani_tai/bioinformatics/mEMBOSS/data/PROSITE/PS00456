* Sodium:solute symporter family signatures and profile *
*********************************************************

It has    been  shown  [1,2]  that integral membrane proteins that mediate the
intake of a wide variety  of  molecules  with the concomitant uptake of sodium
ions (sodium  symporters)  can  be  grouped,  on  the  basis  of  sequence and
functional similarities  into  a  number  of  distinct  families. One of these
families is  known as the  sodium:solute  symporter family (SSF) and currently
consists of the following proteins:

 - Mammalian Na+/glucose co-transporter.
 - Mammalian Na+/myo-inositol co-transporter.
 - Mammalian Na+/nucleoside co-transporter.
 - Mammalian Na+/neutral amino acid co-transporter.
 - Mammalian Na+/iodide co-transporter.
 - Mammalian Na+/multivitamin co-transporter.
 - Escherichia coli Na+/proline symporter (gene putP).
 - Escherichia coli Na+/pantothenate symporter (gene panF).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidK.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjcG.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ywcA (ipa-31R).

These integral  membrane  proteins  are  predicted  to  comprise  at least ten
membrane spanning  domains.  As  signature  patterns we selected two conserved
regions; the  first  one is located in the fourth transmembrane region and the
second one  in a loop between two transmembrane regions in the C-terminal part
of these proteins.
