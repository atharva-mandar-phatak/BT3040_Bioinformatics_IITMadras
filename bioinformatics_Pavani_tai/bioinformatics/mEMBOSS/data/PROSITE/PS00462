* Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase signature *
******************************************

Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2) (GGT) [1]  catalyzes the transfer of
the gamma-glutamyl moiety  of glutathione to an  acceptor that may be an amino
acid, a peptide  or water (forming glutamate).   GGT  plays a  key role in the
gamma-glutamyl  cycle,  a  pathway  for  the  synthesis   and  degradation  of
glutathione.  In prokaryotes  and eukaryotes, it is an enzyme that consists of
two polypeptide  chains,  a heavy and a light subunit, processed from a single
chain precursor.  The  active  site of GGT is known to be located in the light
subunit.

The sequences  of  mammalian  and  bacterial  GGT  show a number of regions of
high similarity  [2].  Pseudomonas  cephalosporin  acylases  (EC 3.5.1.-) that
convert 7-beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)-cephalosporanic   acid   (GL-7ACA)   into
7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7ACA) and  glutaric acid are evolutionary related
to GGT and also show some GGT activity [3].  Like GGT, these GL-7ACA acylases,
are also composed of two subunits.

One of  the  conserved  regions  correspond to the N-terminal extremity of the
mature light chains of these enzymes. We have used this region  as a signature
pattern.
