* Bacterial luciferase subunits signature *
*******************************************

Luminous bacteria  are  abundant and  widely distributed  Gram-negative motile
rods. The enzyme responsible for bioluminescence, bacterial luciferase [1,2,3]
(EC 1.14.14.3),  catalyzes  the  oxidation  of  reduced  riboflavin  phosphate
(FMNH2) and  a long chain fatty aldehyde with the emission of blue green light
(490 nm).  Luciferase  is  a heterodimeric enzyme composed of an alpha subunit
(gene luxA)  and a beta subunit (gene luxB).  The  two subunits appear to have
arisen by gene duplication.

The bioluminescence operon of some species of Photobacterium encodes a protein
known as  the  non-fluorescent  flavoprotein  (NFP)  (gene  luxF).  NFP, whose
function is not yet known, contains an unusual non-covalently bound flavin. It
is evolutionary related to the luxA/luxB subunits.

As a signature for this family, we selected  a conserved region located in the
central part of these proteins.
