* Bacterial ice-nucleation proteins octamer repeat *
****************************************************

Some Gram-negative bacteria  express proteins that  enable them to promote the
nucleation of ice at relatively high temperature (above -5 degree Celsius) [1,
2,3]. These proteins are localized at the surface of the outer membrane of the
bacteria and  can  cause  frost  injury  to  many  plant  species. The primary
structure of  these   ice-nucleation proteins is highly repetitive.  A central
repetitive domain  represents about 80% of the total sequence.  This domain is
mainly formed  by the repetition of a conserved region of forty eight residues
(48-mer).  The 48-mers are themselves composed of three blocks  of 16 residues
(16-mer). The  first eight residues of each of these 16-mers are identical. It
has been proposed that the repetitive domain  may be  directly responsible for
aligning water molecules in the seed crystal.

Schematic structure of a 48-mer region:

-Consensus pattern: A-G-Y-G-S-T-x-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.    This
 octamer sequence  is found more  than forty  times  in each of the known ice-
 nucleation proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: Paramecium primaurelia 168G surface
 protein (contains only one copy of the repeat).
