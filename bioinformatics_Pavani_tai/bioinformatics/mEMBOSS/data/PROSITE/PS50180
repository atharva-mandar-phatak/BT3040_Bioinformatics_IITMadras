* Gamma-adaptin ear (GAE) domain profile *
******************************************

The adaptor proteins AP-1 and GGA (Golgi-localized, gamma ear-containing, ADP-
ribosylation factor  (ARF)-binding proteins) regulate membrane traffic between
the trans-Golgi  network  (TGN)  and  endosome/lysosomes through ARF-regulated
membrane association,  recognition  of  sorting  signals,  and  recruitment of
clathrin and  accessory  proteins.  The gamma-adaptin ear (GAE) domain is a C-
terminal appendage  or  ear  of  about  120 residues, which is found in gamma-
adaptins, the heavy subunits of the AP-1 complex, and in GGAs. The GAE domain,
which is found in associated with other domains such as VHS (see <PDOC50179>),
coiled-coils and  GAT,  is  involved in the recruitment of accessory proteins,
such as  gamma-synergin,  Rababptin-5,  Eps15  and cyclin G-associated kinase,
which modulate the functions of GAE domain containing proteins in the membrane
trafficking events [1,2,3,4].

The resolution of the 3D-structure of the human gamma-adaptin GAE domain shows
that it  forms  an  immunoglobulin-like  beta-sandwich  fold composed of eight
beta-strands with  two  short  alpha-helices (see <PDB:1IU1>). The topology of
the entire  GAE domain is similar to those of the N-terminal subdomains in the
alpha- and  beta-adaptin  ear  domains  of  the AP-2 complex. However, the GAE
domain has   very  low  sequence  identity  and  homology  to  the  N-terminal
immunoglobulin-like subdomains  of the alpha and beta ear domains. The binding
site for  the  accessory  proteins  has  been located to a shallow hydrophobic
trough surrounded by charged (mainly basic) residues [3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire GAE domain.
