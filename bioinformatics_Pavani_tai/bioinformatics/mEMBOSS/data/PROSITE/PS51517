* NDT80 DNA-binding domain profile *
************************************

The NDT80  DNA-binding  domain is found in the following proteins, which might
all be involved in sensing nutritional status [1]:

 - Yeast  meiosis-specific  transcription  factor NDT80, the key transcription
   factor that  ultimately  allows  the  continuation  of  meiosis  after  the
   successful completion of recombination.
 - Emericella  nidulans  phoG  (xprG), a transcriptional activator involved in
   the response to nutrient limitation.
 - Emericella nidulans putative uncharacterized protein AN6015.2.
 - Neurospora  crassa  transcription  factor vib-1, involved in the control of
   heterokaryon incompatibility.
 - Neurospora crassa related to acid phosphatase NCU04729.
 - Neurospora crassa related to meiosis-specific protein NDT80 NCU09915.

The proteolytically  resistant core NDT80 DNA-binding domain reveals a central
beta-sandwich characteristic  of  an  s-type  Ig  fold  (see <PDOC50835>) (see
<PDB:1MNN>). The  beta-sandwich  contains  a  three-stranded sheet composed of
strands a,  b  and e, packed against a four-stranded sheet composed of strands
c', c,  f  and g. Each sheet of the beta-sandwich contains an additional beta-
strand, as  well  as a variety of peripheral secondary structure elements. The
NDT80 DNA-binding domain contains an N-terminal extension, which consists of a
beta-hairpin and a loop [2].

The profile we developed covers the entire NDT80 DNA-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
