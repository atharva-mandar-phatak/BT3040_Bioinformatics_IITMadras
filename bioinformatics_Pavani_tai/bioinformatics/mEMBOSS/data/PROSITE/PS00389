* ATP synthase delta (OSCP) subunit signature *
***********************************************

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.3.14) [1,2]  is a component
of the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,
and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of
an oligomeric  transmembrane  sector, called CF(0),  which acts  as  a  proton
channel, and a catalytic core, termed coupling factor CF(1).

One of  the subunits of the ATPase complex, known as subunit delta in bacteria
and chloroplasts  or  the  Oligomycin  Sensitivity Conferral Protein (OSCP) in
mitochondria, seems  to  be  part  of  the stalk that links CF(0) to CF(1). It
either transmits  conformational  changes from CF(0) into CF(1) or is involved
in proton conduction [3].

The different delta/OSCP subunits are proteins of approximately 200 amino-acid
residues -  once  the  transit peptide has been removed in the chloroplast and
mitochondrial forms - which show only moderate sequence homology.

The signature pattern used to detect ATPase delta/OSCP subunits is  based on a
conserved region in the C-terminal section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[LIVMFYT]-x(3)-[LIVMT]-[DENQK]-x-{G}-[LIVM]-x-
                    [GSA]-G-[LIVMFYGA]-{S}-[LIVM]-[KRHENQ]-x-[GSEN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 3 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
