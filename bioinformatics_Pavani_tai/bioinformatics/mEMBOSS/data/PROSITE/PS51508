* CKK domain profile *
**********************

The C-terminal CKK domain is common to CAMSAP1 (calmodulin-regulated spectrin-
associated protein  1), KIAA1078 (CAMSAP2), and KIAA1543 (CAMSAP3). The CAMSAP
family represents  a novel class of microtubule-binding protein. It is defined
by a  unique architecture, namely, a CH-like domain (see <PDOC50021>) near the
N-terminus and  the  CKK  domain at the C-terminus. The strong conservation of
the sequence  of  the  CKK  domain  suggests that its fold is conserved in all
eumetazoan. The  structure  of  the  CKK  domain  is  a  beta  barrel  with an
associated alpha helical hairpin (see <PDB:1UGJ>). Characteristically, the CKK
domain has  a  single  invariant  Trp  within  the core of the predicted beta-
barrel. Residues  that  interact  with  this Trp to form part of this core are
highly conserved too. The CKK domain binds microtubules [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire CKK domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
