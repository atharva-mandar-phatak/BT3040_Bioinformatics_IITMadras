* Homocysteine-binding domain profile *
***************************************

The homocysteine (Hcy) binding domain is an ~300-residue module which is found
in a set of enzymes involved in alkyl transfer to thiols:

 - Prokaryotic   and   eukaryotic  B12-dependent  methionine  synthase  (MetH)
   (EC 2.1.1.13),  a  large,  modular protein that catalyses the transfer of a
   methyl group  from  methyltetrahydrofolate  (CH3-H4folate)  to  Hcy to form
   methionine, using cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier.
 - Mammalian  betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) (EC 2.1.1.5). It
   catalyzes the  transfer  of  a  methyl  group  from glycine betaine to Hcy,
   forming methionine and dimethylglycine.
 - Plant selenocysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-).
 - Plant and fungal AdoMet homocysteine S-methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.10).

The Hcy-binding  domain  utilizes a Zn(Cys)3 cluster to bind and activate Hcy.
It has  been  shown  to  form a (beta/alpha)8 barrel (see <PDB:1Q7Z>). The Hcy
binding domain  barrel  is  distorted to form the metal- and substrate-binding
sites. To accommodate the substrate, strands 1 and 2 of the barrel are loosely
joined by nonclassic hydrogen bonds; to accommodate the metal, strands 6 and 8
are drawn  together  and  strand 7 is extruded from the end of the barrel. The
cysteines ligating  the catalytic zinc atom are located at the C-terminal ends
of strands 6 and 8 [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire Hcy domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
