* Munc13-homology domains 1 and 2 (MHD1 and MHD2) profiles *
************************************************************

Munc13 proteins  constitute  a  family  of  three  highly homologous molecules
(Munc13-1, Munc13-2  and  Munc13-3)  with  homology  to Caenorhabditis elegans
unc-13p. Munc13  proteins  contain  a  phorbol  ester-binding  C1  domain (see
<PDOC00379>) and  two  C2 domains, which are Ca2+/phospholipid binding domains
(see <PDOC00380>).  Sequence analyses have uncovered two regions called Munc13
homology domains  1 (MHD1) and 2 (MHD2) that are arranged between two flanking
C2 domains.  MHD1  and  MHD2 domains are present in a wide variety of proteins
from Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mouse, rat and
human, some of which may function in a Munc13-like manner to regulate membrane
trafficking [1].

The MHD1 and MHD2 domains are predicted to be alpha-helical [2].

Some proteins known to contain MHD1 and MHD2 domains are listed below:

 - Mammalian Munc13-1. It is specifically targeted to presynaptic active zones
   and has  a  central  priming  function  in synaptic vesicle exocytosis from
   glutaminergic synapses.
 - Mammalian Munc13-2. It plays a role in vesicle maturation during exocytosis
   as a target of the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway.
 - Mammalian  Munc13-3.  It probably plays a role in vesicle maturation during
   exocytosis as a target of the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway.
 - Mammalian  Munc13-4.  It  is  predominantly  expressed  in lung where it is
   localized to  goblet cells of the bronchial epithelium and to alveolar type
   II cells, both of which are cell types with secretory function.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  unc-13p. It may form part of a signal transduction
   pathway, transducing the signal from diacylglycerol to effector functions.
 - Mammalian  BAI1-associated  protein  3  (BAP3)  which  exhibit  the typical
   Munc13-like domain structure with two C2 domains flanking the MHD1 and MHD2
   domains, but which lack the long N-terminus with the C1 domain.
 - Animal   calcium-dependent   activator   proteins  for  secretion  (CAPSs),
   regulators of  large dense-core vesicle secretion. They contain only a MHD1
   domain and are otherwise unrelated to Munc13 proteins.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  hypothetical proteins with MHD1 and MHD2 domains but
   without C1 and C2 domains.
 - Yeast  uncharacterized  protein  YOR296W,  where  MHD1  and  MHD2 enclose a
   central C2 domain. YOR296W is presumably involved in bud formation.
 - Fission  yeast  hypothetical  protein C11E3.02c in chromosome I, where MHD1
   and MHD2 enclose a central C2 domain.

The profile we developed covers the entire MHD1 and MHD2 domains.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
