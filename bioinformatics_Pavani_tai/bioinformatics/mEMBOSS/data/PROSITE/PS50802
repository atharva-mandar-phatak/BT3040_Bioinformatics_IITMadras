* OTU domain profile *
**********************

An homology  region  containing  four  conserved motifs has been identified in
proteins from  eukaryotes,  several  groups  of  viruses  and  the  pathogenic
bacteria Chlamydia  pneumoniae  [1].  None  of  these  proteins  has  a  known
biochemical function  but low sequence similarity with the polyprotein regions
of arteriviruses  has  lead to suggest that it could possess cysteine protease
activity [1].  In  this  case, the conserved cysteine and aspartate in motif I
and the  histidine  in motif IV could be the catalytic residues. Motifs II and
III have  a  more  limited  sequence  conservation  and  could  be involved in
substrate recognition [1].

It has  been  proposed  that  the eukaryotic proteins containing an OTU domain
could mediate  proteolytic  events  involved  in signaling associated with the
modification of chromatin structure and control of cell proliferation [1].

Some proteins containing a OTU domain are listed below [1]:

 - Ovarian Tumor (OTU), a Drosophila protein involved in oocyte morphogenesis.
   As the  putative catalytic cysteine is replaced by a serine it is not clear
   whether OTU is an active protease or in inactivated protease homologue.
 - Putative HIV-1 induced protein (HIN1), the human homologue of OTU.
 - B0546.2 protein, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of OTU.
 - M2 protein from La France disease virus.
 - Tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-induced  protein  A20  (TNP3)  from mammals. It
   protects cells  from  apoptosis and blocks activation of lymphoid cells. In
   addition to  the  OTU domain, TNP3 contains several copies of a zinc finger
   like motif  that is also present in other proteins implicated in ubiquitin-
   dependent proteolysis.
 - Hypothetical  protein  YFL044C  from  yeast, a protein that also contains a
   C2H2 zinc finger.
 - Hypothetical protein F12K2.7 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.
 - Hypothetical protein C25D7.8 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans.
 - Hypothetical protein CPN0483 from Chlamydia pneumoniae.

The profile we developed covers the entire OTU domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
