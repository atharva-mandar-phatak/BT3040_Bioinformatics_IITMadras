**************************************************

A family  of  bacterial  and  eukaryotic endonucleases (EC 3.1.30.-) share the
following characteristics:  they  act  on  both  DNA  and  RNA, cleave double-
stranded and  single-standed  nucleic acids and require a divalent ion such as
magnesium for their activity. The enzymes that belongs to this family are:

 - Extracellular nuclease from Serratia marcescens.
 - Extracellular nuclease nucA from the cyanobacteria Anabaena PCC 7120.
 - DNA-entry nuclease from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 - Mammalian mitochondrial endonuclease G (endo G).
 - Yeast mitochondrial endonuclease NUC1.
 - Nuclease C1 from the fungi Cunninghamella echinulata.

An histidine  has  been  shown  [1]  to  be  essential for the activity of the
Serratia marcescens  nuclease.  This residue is located in a conserved  region
which can  be  used as a signature pattern and which also contains an aspartic
acid residue that could be implicated in the binding of the divalent ion.

-Consensus pattern: D-R-G-H-[QLIM]-x(3)-[AG]
                    [H is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
