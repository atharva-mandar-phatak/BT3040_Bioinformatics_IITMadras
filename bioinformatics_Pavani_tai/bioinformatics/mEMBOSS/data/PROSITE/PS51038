* BAH domain profile *
**********************

The  Bromo-adjacent  homology (BAH) domain is a domain first identified in the
vertebrate  polybromo  protein, a protein present in the large nuclear complex
Swi/Snf  [1,2]. It corresponds to a region of about 110 amino-acids, which can
contain  insertions  of  variable length. This domain has been identified in a
number of proteins present in large complex involved in chromatin replication,
epigenetic   mechanisms   (DNA  methylation),  transcriptional  repression  or
activation [1]. The BAH domain appears to act as a protein-protein interaction
module  specialized  in gene silencing, as suggested by its interaction within
yeast  Orc1p  with the silent information regulator Sir1p [1]. It can be found
in a duplicated form in PB1 as well as in animal DNA MTases, or unique in CMT1
for example.

The  BAH  domain  is  frequently  found  in  association  with  other  domains
implicated in epigenetic mechanisms such as bromodomain (see <PDOC00550>), SET
(see <PDOC50280>), PHD finger (see <PDOC50016>), and/or in DNA binding such as
HMG  boxes  (see  <PDOC00305>), AT hooks, GATA (see <PDOC00300>), and myb-like
domains (see <PDOC00037>).

The  crystal  structure of the BAH domain has been solved (see <PDB:1M4Z>)[3],
It  revealed  that  it consists of an elongated shape that can be divided in a
large  subdomain  comprised  of  mainly  anti-parallel beta-strands (beta-1 to
beta-10) and a small helical subdomain.

The profile we developed covers the BAH structure from beta-4 to beta-10.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
