*****************************************

Amyloidogenic glycoprotein  (A4  protein or APP)  is an integral, glycosylated
membrane brain protein [1,2]. APP is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
This responsibility stems from the fact that a small peptide (of 43 residues),
called  the  amyloid beta protein, which is part of the sequence of A4, is the
major  constituent  of amyloid deposits in AD and in Down's syndrome. As shown
in  the schematic representation below, the amyloid beta protein both precedes
and forms part of the unique transmembrane region of A4.

'X': Transmembrane region.
'B': Position of the amyloid beta protein in A4.

The exact function of A4 protein  is not  yet known, but it has been suggested
that it mediates cell-cell interactions.  The sequence  of  A4  from mammalian
species is well conserved and is also similar to that of other proteins:

 - Drosophila APPL (gene vnd) [3].
 - Mammalian protein APLP1 [4].
 - Mammalian protein APLP2 (APPH) (YWK-II) (CDEI-binding protein) [5].

We have derived  two  patterns specific to these proteins,  the first one is a
perfectly conserved octapeptide  located in the beginning of the extracellular
domain; the second is a conserved octapeptide located at the C-terminal end of
the cytoplasmic domain.
