* Dehydrins signatures *
************************

A number of proteins are  produced  by  plants  that  experience water-stress.
Water-stress takes place  when  the  water  available to a plant falls below a
critical level.  The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) appears to modulate the
response of plant to water-stress. Proteins  that  are expressed during water-
stress are  called dehydrins [1,2] or LEA group 2 proteins [3].  The  proteins
that belong to this family are listed below.

 - Arabidopsis thaliana XERO 1, XERO 2 (LTI30), RAB18, ERD10 (LTI45) ERD14 and
   COR47.
 - Barley dehydrins B8, B9, B17, and B18.
 - Cotton LEA protein D-11.
 - Craterostigma plantagineum dessication-related proteins A and B.
 - Maize dehydrin M3 (RAB-17).
 - Pea dehydrins DHN1, DHN2, and DHN3.
 - Radish LEA protein.
 - Rice proteins RAB 16B, 16C, 16D, RAB21, and RAB25.
 - Tomato TAS14.
 - Wheat dehydrin RAB 15 and cold-shock protein cor410, cs66 and cs120.

Dehydrins share  a  number of  structural features. One  of  the  most notable
features is the presence, in  their  central  region,  of a continuous  run of
five to nine serines followed by a cluster of  charged residues. Such a region
has been  found  in  all  known dehydrins so  far  with  the  exception of pea
dehydrins. A second  conserved  feature is  the  presence  of  two copies of a
lysine-rich octapeptide; the  first copy  is  located just after  the  cluster
of charged residues  that  follows  the poly-serine region and the second copy
is found at the C-terminal extremity. We have have derived  signature patterns
for both regions.

-Consensus pattern: S(4)-[SD]-[DE]-x-[DE]-[GVE]-x(1,7)-[GE]-x(0,2)-[KR](4)
