* J-protein family domains signature and profiles *
***************************************************

The  hsp70  chaperone machine (see <PDOC00269>) performs many diverse roles in
the cell, including folding of nascent proteins, translocation of polypeptides
across  organelle  membranes,  coordinating responses to stress, and targeting
selected  proteins  for  degradation.  DnaJ is a member of the hsp40 family of
molecular  chaperones,  which is also called the J-protein family, the members
of  which  regulate the activity of hsp70s. DnaJ (hsp40) binds to dnaK (hsp70)
and  stimulates  its  ATPase activity, generating the ADP-bound state of dnaK,
which  interacts  stably  with  the  polypeptide substrate [1,2].

DnaJ  consists  of an N-terminal conserved domain (called 'J' domain) of about
70  amino  acid  residues,  a  glycine  and  phenylalanine-rich  domain ('G/F'
domain),  a central cysteine rich domain (CR-type zinc finger) containing four
repeats  of  a  CXXCXGXG  motif  which  can  coordinate  two  zinc  atom and a
C-terminal domain (CTD) [2].

Such a structure is shown in the following schematic representation:

    +------------+-+-----------+-----+-----------+-------------+
    |  J-domain  | | Gly/Phe-R |     | CXXCXGXG  |     CTD     |
    +------------+-+-----------+-----+-----------+-------------+

The  structures  of  the  'J' domain (see <PDB:1XBL>) and the 'CR' domain (see
<PDB:1EXK>) have been solved [3,4]. The J domain consists of four helices, the
second  of  which  has a charged surface that includes basic residues that are
essential  for  interaction  with  the ATPase domain of hsp70 [5]. The CR-type
zinc  finger  has  an  overall V-shaped extended beta-hairpin topology and two
symmetrical  zinc  binding  sites, designated as Zn1 and Zn2: Zn1 is formed by
the two cysteine motifs that are furthest apart in the primary sequence, while
Zn2  is  formed  by the two central, adjacent cysteine motifs [4]. It has been
shown  that  Zn1  is  important for the autonomous, dnaK-independent chaperone
activity,  while Zn2 is a necessary interaction site with dnaK, which seems to
be crucial for in vivo function in the dnaJ/dnaK system [6].

J-protein family are classified in three classes [2]:

The  type  1 contains proteins with a J-domain, a G/F domain, a CR zinc finger
and a CTD domain (true homologues of dnaJ):

 - Yeast   protein   MAS5/YDJ1   that  is  involved  in  protein  folding  and
   mitochondrial protein import.
 - Yeast    protein MDJ1 that is involved in protein folding and mitochondrial
   protein import.
 - Yeast  protein SCJ1 that is involved in protein folding in the lumen of the
   endoplasmic reticulum.
 - Yeast protein APJ1/YNL077w, that might modulate folding reaction.
 - Cucumber dnaJ homolog anchored at the glyoxysomal membrane.
 - Yeast protein XDJ1.
 - Human protein HDJ2.

The type 2 contains proteins with a J-domain, a G/F domain and a CTD domain:

 - Rhizobium  fredii  nolC, a protein involved in cultivar-specific nodulation
   of soybean.
 - Escherichia coli cbpA, a protein that binds curved DNA.
 - Yeast protein SIS1, required for nuclear migration during mitosis.
 - Yeast protein CAJ1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YFR041c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIR004w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJL162c.
 - Plasmodium falciparum  ring-infected  erythrocyte  surface  antigen (RESA).
   RESA, whose function is not known, is associated with the membrane skeleton
   of newly invaded erythrocytes.
 - Human HDJ1.
 - Human HSJ1, a neuronal protein.
 - Drosophila cysteine-string protein (csp).

The type 3 subgroup contains proteins that have only the J-domain:

 - Yeast  protein SEC63/NPL1. It is important  for  protein  assembly into the
   endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus.
 - Eukaryotic  Tim14  protein.  An  essential  component of the PAM complex, a
   complex  required  for  the  translocation  of  transit  peptide-containing
   proteins  from  the  inner  membrane  into  the  mitochondrial matrix in an
   ATP-dependent  manner. In the complex, it is required to stimulate activity
   of mtHSP70 (SSC1).
 - Yeast  Jac1  protein  and  HscB  eukaryotic  homologues.  They  may  act as
   co-chaperones in iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria.
 - Yeast  Zuo1 protein. Zuo1 and Ssz1 (hsp70) are targeted to ribosomes, where
   they form the functionally active RAC complex.
 - Yeast Jjj1 to 3, Erj5 and Jid1 proteins of unknown function.

We  developed  a  signature  pattern  for  the  'J' domain, based on conserved
positions  in  the  C-terminal  half  of  this  domain.  We also developed two
profiles,  one which covers the entire 'J' domain and the other that spans the
whole CR-type zinc finger.
