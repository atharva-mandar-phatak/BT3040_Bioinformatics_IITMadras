Xeroderma  pigmentosum (XP) [1]  is a  human   autosomal   recessive  disease,
characterized by  a  high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer.  People's
skin cells  with this condition  are  hypersensitive to ultraviolet light, due
to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair. There are a minimum of
seven genetic complementation  groups  involved in this pathway: XP-A to XP-G.
The defect in XP-G can be corrected by a 133 Kd nuclear protein called XPG (or
XPGC) [2].

XPG belongs  to a family  of  proteins  [2,3,4,5,6]  that  are composed of two
main subsets:

 - Subset  1,  to  which  belongs  XPG, RAD2 from budding yeast and rad13 from
   fission yeast.  RAD2  and  XPG are single-stranded DNA endonucleases [7,8].
   XPG makes the 3'incision in human DNA nucleotide excision repair [9].
 - Subset 2, to which belongs mouse and human FEN-1,  rad2 from fission yeast,
   and RAD27 from budding yeast. FEN-1 is a structure-specific endonuclease.

In addition  to  the  proteins  listed  in  the above groups, this family also
includes:

 - Fission yeast exo1, a 5'->3' double-stranded DNA exonuclease that could act
   in a pathway that corrects mismatched base pairs.
 - Yeast EXO1 (DHS1), a protein with probably the same function as exo1.
 - Yeast DIN7.

Sequence alignment  of  this  family of proteins reveals that similarities are
largely confined  to  two  regions.  The  first  is  located at the N-terminal
extremity  (N-region) and corresponds to the first 95 to 105 amino acids.  The
second region  is  internal  (I-region)  and  found towards the C-terminus; it
spans about  140  residues  and  contains a highly  conserved core of 27 amino
acids that includes a conserved pentapeptide (E-A-[DE]-A-[QS]). It is possible
that the  conserved acidic residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism of
DNA excision repair in XPG.  The  amino acids linking the N- and I-regions are
not conserved;  indeed, they are largely absent from proteins belonging to the
second subset.

We have  developed  two  signature  patterns  for  these proteins.  The  first
corresponds to  the central part of the N-region, the second to part of the I-
region and includes the putative catalytic core pentapeptide.
