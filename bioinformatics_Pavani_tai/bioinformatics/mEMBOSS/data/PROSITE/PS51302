* Single-minded C-terminal domain profile *
*******************************************

In Drosophila,  single-minded (sim) is a transcription factor that acts as the
master regulator  of  neurogenesis.  Two  mammalian  homologs of Sim, Sim1 and
Sim2, have  been identified. There is a high level of homology among mammalian
and Drosophila  sim  proteins in their amino-terminal half where the conserved
bHLH (see  <PDOC00038>), PAS (see <PDOC50112>) and HST domains are present. In
contrast, the  carboxy-terminal  parts  are only conserved in vertebrates [1].
The Sim1  C-terminus  contains  a Ser-rich region, whereas the Sim2 C-terminus
both contain Ser/Thr-rich regions, Pro/Ser-rich regions, Pro/Ala-rich regions,
and positively  charged  regions.  Sim2s,  a  splice  variant  of  Sim2, still
contains the  Ser/Thr-  and  Pro/Ser-rich  regions  shown to harbor repressive
activities, but is missing the Pro/Ala-rich repressor region [1-3].

The profile we developed covers the entire single-minded C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2007 / First entry.
