* Formate and nitrite transporters signatures *
***********************************************

A number  of  bacterial  and archaebacterial proteins involved in transporting
formate or nitrite have been shown [1] to be related:

 - focA  and  focB,  from  Escherichia  coli,  transporters  involved  in  the
   bidirectional transport of formate.
 - fdhC,  from  Methanobacterium  formicicum  and thermoformicicum, a probable
   formate transporter.
 - nirC,  from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, a probable nitrite
   transporter.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yrhG.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ywcJ (ipa-48R).

These transporters are proteins of about 280 residues and  seem to contain six
transmembrane regions.  As  signature  patterns,  we  selected  two  conserved
regions. The  first  one  is  located  in  what seems to be a cytoplasmic loop
between the second and third transmembrane  domains; the second is part of the
fourth transmembrane region.

The 70  Kd  yeast  hypothetical  protein  YHL008c  is  highly  similar, in its
N-terminal section, to the prokaryotic members of this family.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMA]-[LIVMY]-x-G-[GSTA]-[DES]-L-[FI]-[TN]-[GS]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Consensus pattern: [GA]-x(2)-[CA]-N-[LIVMFYW](2)-V-C-[LV]-A
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belongs  to  family  TC 2.44 in  the classification of
 transporters [2].
