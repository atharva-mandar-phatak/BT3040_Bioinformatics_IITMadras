* ATP-binding cassette, ABC transporter-type, signature and profile *
*********************************************************************

ABC  transporters  belong  to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily which
uses  the  hydrolysis  of  ATP  to  energize  diverse  biological systems. ABC
transporters  are  minimally  constituted  of  two conserved regions: a highly
conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain
(TMD).  These  regions  can  be  found on the same protein or on two different
ones.  Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted
of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs [1].

ABC  transporters  are  involved  in the export or import of a wide variety of
substrates  ranging  from  small ions to macromolecules. The major function of
ABC  import  systems  is  to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are
found  only  in  prokaryotes  and  their four constitutive domains are usually
encoded  by  independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins).
Prokaryotic importers  require  additional  extracytoplasmic  binding proteins
(one or  more  per  systems)  for  function.  In  contrast, export systems are
involved in  the  extrusion of noxious substances, the export of extracellular
toxins and  the targeting of membrane components. They are found in all living
organisms and  in  general  the TMD is fused to the ABC module in a variety of
combinations. Some   eukaryotic   exporters   encode   the   four  domains  on
the same polypeptide chain [2,3].

The  ABC  module  (approximately  two hundred amino acid residues) is known to
bind  and  hydrolyze  ATP,  thereby  coupling transport to ATP hydrolysis in a
large  number  of  biological processes. The cassette is duplicated in several
subfamilies.  Its  primary  sequence is highly conserved, displaying a typical
phosphate-binding loop:  Walker A  (see  <PDOC00017>), and a magnesium binding
site:  Walker  B.  Besides these two regions, three other conserved motifs are
present  in  the  ABC  cassette:  the switch region which contains a histidine
loop,  postulated to polarize the attaching water molecule for hydrolysis, the
signature  conserved  motif  (LSGGQ)  specific to the ABC transporter, and the
Q-motif  (between  Walker A and the signature), which interacts with the gamma
phosphate  through  a  water  bond.  The Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop and switch
region form the nucleotide binding site [4,5,6].

The  3D  structure  of a monomeric ABC module adopts a stubby L-shape with two
distinct  arms  (see  <PDB:1B0U>). ArmI (mainly beta-strand) contains Walker A
and  Walker  B.  The  important residues for ATP hydrolysis and/or binding are
located  in  the P-loop. The ATP-binding pocket is located at the extremity of
armI. The perpendicular armII contains mostly the alpha helical subdomain with
the  signature motif. It only seems to be required for structural integrity of
the  ABC  module.  ArmII  is in direct contact with the TMD. The hinge between
armI and armII contains both the histidine loop and the Q-loop, making contact
with  the  gamma  phosphate  of  the  ATP  molecule. ATP hydrolysis leads to a
conformational  change that could facilitate ADP release. In the dimer the two
ABC  cassettes  contact  each  other  through  hydrophobic interactions at the
antiparallel beta-sheet of armI by a two-fold axis [7,8,9,10,11,12].

Proteins  known  to belong to this family are classified in several functional
subfamilies depending on the substrate used [E1].

All  different  types of transporters with a functional attribution are listed
below (references are only provided for recently characterized proteins).

 - ALDP, a peroxisomal protein involved in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
 - Antigen  peptide  transporters  1  (TAP1,  PSF1,  RING4, HAM-1, mtp1) and 2
   (TAP2, PSF2,  RING11, HAM-2, mtp2), which  are involved in the transport of
   antigens from      the   cytoplasm  to  a  membrane-bound  compartment  for
   association with MHC class I molecules.
 - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),  which  is most
   probably involved in the transport of chloride ions.

   import of ommatidium screening pigments.
 - Fungal elongation factor 3 (EF-3).
 - Multidrug   transporters  (Mdr1)  (P-glycoprotein),  a  family  of  closely
   related proteins which extrude a wide variety of drugs out of the cell.
 - 70 Kd peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70).
 - Sulfonylurea  receptor,  a  putative  subunit  of the B-cell  ATP-sensitive
   potassium channel.

As a signature pattern for this class of proteins, we use a  conserved  region
which is  located  between the 'A' and the 'B' motifs of the ATP-binding site.
The  profile  we  developed  is  directed  against the conserved ABC module by
covering  the  region  between  beta strand 1 and alpha helix 9, including not
only  the conserved motifs but also structural elements found N and C terminal
to  them.  Our profile also recognizes the UvrA family which is evolutionarily
related to the ABC transporter family.

                    [SAGCLIVP]-{FYWHP}-{KRHP}-[LIVMFYWSTA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 25 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 53.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The ATP-binding region is  duplicated in araG, mdl, msrA,  rbsA,  tlrC,
 uvrA, yejF, Mdr's, CFTR, pmd1 and in EF-3.  In  some  of  those proteins, the
 above pattern only detect one of the two copies of the domain.
