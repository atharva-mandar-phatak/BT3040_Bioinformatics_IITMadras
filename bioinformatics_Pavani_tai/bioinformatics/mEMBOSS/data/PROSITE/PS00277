* Staphylococcal enterotoxins / Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins signatures *
******************************************************************************

Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins constitute a
family of   biologically   and   structurally   related   toxins  produced  by
Staphylococcus aureus and  Streptococcus  pyogenes [1,2].  These  toxins share
the ability  to bind to the major histocompatibility complex proteins of their
hosts. The toxins that belong to this family are:

 - Staphylococcal enterotoxins are  the cause of staphylococcal food poisoning
   syndrome.  The sequence  of six  different enterotoxins is known: SEA, SEB,
   SEC1, SEC3, SED, and SEE.
 - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins  are the causative agents of the symptoms
   associated with scarlet fever.  The sequence  of two pyrogenic exotoxins is
   known: SPEA, and SPEC.
 - Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).

While the enterotoxins and the pyrogenic exotoxins are closely related, TSST-1
seems to be only distantly  related  to  the other toxins.  We  developed  two
patterns for this family of toxins. The first one is based on a well conserved
region of enterotoxins and pyrogenic exotoxins,  but  which  does  not pick up
TSST-1; the second pattern is derived from a more diffuse region of similarity
common to all these toxins.

-Consensus pattern: Y-G(2)-[LIV]-T-{I}-{N}-x(2)-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for TSST-1.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Consensus pattern: K-x(2)-[LIVF]-x(4)-[LIVF]-D-x(3)-R-x(2)-L-x(5)-[LIV]-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
