* Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I signature and profile *
********************************************************

Cytochrome  c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1)  [1]  is an oligomeric integral membrane
protein  complexes  that  catalyze the terminal step in the respiratory chain:
they transfer electrons from cytochrome c or a quinol to oxygen. Some terminal
oxidases  generate  a transmembrane proton gradient across the plasma membrane
(prokaryotes)  or  the  mitochondrial  inner membrane (eukaryotes). The enzyme
complex consists of 3-4 subunits (prokaryotes) up to 13 polypeptides (mammals)
of which only the catalytic subunit (equivalent to mammalian subunit 1 (CO I))
is found in all heme-copper respiratory oxidases. The presence of a bimetallic
center,  formed  by  a  high-spin  heme  (heme  a3) and copper B, as well as a
low-spin  heme (heme a), both ligated to six conserved histidine residues near
the outer side of four transmembrane spans within CO I is common to all family
members [2-4].

In contrary to  eukaryotes the respiratory chain of prokaryotes is branched to
multiple terminal  oxidases.  The  enzyme  complexes  vary  in heme and copper
composition, substrate  type and substrate affinity. The different respiratory
oxidases  allow  the cells to customize their  respiratory systems according a
variety of environmental growth conditions [1].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  whole  enzyme complexe have been solved [5].
Subunit I contains 12 transmembrane helical segments and binds heme a and heme
a3-copper  B binuclear centre where molecular oxygen is reduced to water. (see
<PDB:1OCZ; A>).

Recently also  a component of an anaerobic respiratory chain has been found to
contain  the copper B binding signature of this family: nitric oxide reductase
(NOR) exists in denitrifying species of Archae and Eubacteria.

Enzymes that belong to this family are:

 - Mitochondrial-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC  1.9.3.1) which uses cytochrome
   c as electron donor. The electrons are transferred via copper A (Cu(A)) and
   heme a  to  the  bimetallic  center  of  CO  I  that  is formed by a penta-
   coordinated heme   a     and  copper  B  (Cu(B)).  Subunit  1  contains  12
   transmembrane regions.  Cu(B)  is  said  to  be  ligated  to  three  of the
   conserved histidine  residues  within  the  transmembrane segments 6 and 7.
 - Quinol oxidase  from prokaryotes  that transfers electrons from a quinol to
   the binuclear  center  of  polypeptide I. This category of enzymes includes
   Escherichia coli cytochrome O terminal oxidase complex which is a component
   of the  aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are grown at
   high aeration.
 - FixN,  the  catalytic  subunit  of  a  cytochrome  c  oxidase  expressed in
   nitrogen-fixing bacteroids  living  in  root nodules. The high affinity for
   oxygen allows oxidative phosphorylation under low  oxygen concentrations. A
   similar enzyme has been found in other purple bacteria.
 - Nitric oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.7) from Pseudomonas stutzeri. NOR reduces
   nitrate to  dinitrogen.  It  is  a  heterodimer  of  norC and the catalytic
   subunit norB. The latter contains the 6 invariant histidine residues and 12
   transmembrane segments [6].

As  a signature pattern we used the copper-binding region. We also developed a
profile that cover the whole subunit I.
