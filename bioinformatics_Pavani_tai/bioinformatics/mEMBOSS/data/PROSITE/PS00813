* Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E signature *
*********************************************

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E)  [1]  is  a  protein that
binds to the cap structure of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs. eIF-4E recognizes and
binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing (m7Gppp)  cap  during  an early step in
the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding to a mRNA
by inducing the unwinding of its secondary structures.

eIF-4E is  a  conserved protein  of  about 25 Kd.  Site  directed  mutagenesis
experiments  have  shown [2]  that  a  tryptophan  in  the central part of the
sequence of human eIF-4E seems to be implicated in cap-binding.  The signature
pattern for eIF-4E includes this tryptophan.

-Consensus pattern: [DE]-[IFYL]-x(2)-F-[KRL]-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-P-x-W-E-[DVA]-x(5)-
                    G-G-[KR]-W
                    [The first W seems to be involved in cap-binding]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
