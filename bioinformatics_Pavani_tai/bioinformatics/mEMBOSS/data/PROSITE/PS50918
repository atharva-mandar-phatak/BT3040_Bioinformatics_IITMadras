* WWE domain profile *
**********************

The WWE  domain  is  a  ~80-residue globular domain occuring in two functional
classes of  proteins,  namely  those  associated with ubiquitination and those
associated with   poly-ADP   ribosylation.   The  former  class  includes  its
combinations with the HECT-type E3 ligases (see <PDOC50237>), the classic RING
or the RING-H2 domains (see <PDOC00449>), and the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain
(see <PDOC50030>).  Analogous  to  the  ubiquitin ligases, eukaryotic poly-ADP
ribose polymerases  (EC  2.4.2.30)  (PARPs) covalently modify proteins through
the addition of multiple ADP-ribose moieties and participate in functions such
as DNA  repair  and  chromatin  dynamics.  The WWE domain is present in either
single or  duplicate copies in a novel sub-family of PARPs. The WWE domain was
named after  its  most  conserved  residues, two tryptophan (W) residues and a
glutamate (E)  residue. It has been suggested that the WWE domain functions in
specific interactions  with  other  proteins  and  could help in targeting the
different kinds   of  E3-like  and  ADP-ribosylation  activities  to  proteins
participating in various signaling cascades [1].

Secondary structure  prediction suggests the presence of multiple beta strands
that correspond  to  the conserved N- and C- terminal motifs of the WWE domain
that are  enriched  in  hydrophobic  or  aromatic  residues. There is a single
prominent helix that corresponds to the central motif containing the conserved
glutamate. The secondary structure pattern with a two-strand hairpin at the N-
terminus followed  by a helix is reminiscent of the beta-grasp fold adopted by
ubiquitin and several other eukaryotic specific alpha/beta domains [1].

Some proteins known to contain a WWE domain are listed below:

 - Animal  members  of  the  Deltex (DTX) family, which act as Notch signaling
   modifiers and  may  also  regulate  transcription through interactions with
   specific transcription factors.
 - Vertebrate  thyroid  receptor  interacting  protein  12  (TRIP12), an HECT-
   domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase.
 - An eukaryotic family of poly-ADP ribose polymerases (EC 2.4.2.30) (PARPs).

The profile we developed covers the entire WWE domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
