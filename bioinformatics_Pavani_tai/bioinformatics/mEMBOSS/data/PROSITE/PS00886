* Dihydroxy-acid and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratases signatures *
*****************************************************************

Two dehydratases have been shown [1] to be evolutionary related:

 - Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.9) (gene ilvD or ILV3) which catalyzes
   the fourth   step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  isoleucine  and  valine,  the
   dehydratation of  2,3-dihydroxy-isovaleic  acid  into  alpha-ketoisovaleric
   acid.
 - 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.12) (gene edd) which catalyzes the
   first step in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the dehydratation of 6-phospho-
   D-gluconate into 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhG.

Both enzymes  are  proteins  of about 600 amino acid residues. We selected two
highly conserved  regions  as signature patterns. The first pattern is located
in the  N-terminal  part and contains a cysteine that could be involved in the
binding of  a 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster [2]. The second pattern is located in
the C-terminal half.

-Consensus pattern: C-D-K-x(2)-P-[GA]-x(3)-[GA]
                    [The C could be a 2Fe-2S ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [SGALC]-[LIMF]-[LIVMF]-T-D-[GA]-R-[LIVMFY]-S-[GA]-[GAV]-
                    [ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
