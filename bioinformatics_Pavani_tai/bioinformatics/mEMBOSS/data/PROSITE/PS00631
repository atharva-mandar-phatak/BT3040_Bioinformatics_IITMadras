* Cytosol aminopeptidase signature *
************************************

Cytosol  aminopeptidase is a eukaryotic cytosolic  zinc-dependent exopeptidase
that catalyzes  the removal  of unsubstituted  amino-acid  residues  from  the
N-terminus of proteins. This enzyme is  often  known as leucine aminopeptidase
(EC 3.4.11.1) (LAP)  but  has  been shown [1]  to  be  identical  with  prolyl
aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5). Cytosol aminopeptidase is a hexamer of identical
chains, each of which binds two zinc ions.

Cytosol aminopeptidase is highly similar to Escherichia coli pepA, a manganese
dependent aminopeptidase.  Residues  involved  in  zinc ion-binding [2] in the
mammalian enzyme are  absolutely  conserved in pepA where they presumably bind
manganese. Most bacterial species contain a pepA-type enzyme.

As a signature pattern  for these  enzymes, we  selected a perfectly conserved
octapeptide which  contains  two  residues  involved in binding metal ions: an
aspartate and a glutamate.

-Consensus pattern: [NS]-[TS]-D-A-E-G-R-[LVMI]
                    [The D and the E are zinc/manganese ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family M17 in the classification of peptidases
 [3,E1].

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
