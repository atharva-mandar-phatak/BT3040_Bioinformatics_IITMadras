**************************

Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase (EC  2.7.8.13) (mraY) [1] is
a bacterial  enzyme  responsible    for    the    formation of the first lipid
intermediate of  the  cell  wall  peptidoglycan  synthesis.  It  catalyzes the
formation of   undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide  from
UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and undecaprenyl-phosphate.

It is an integral membrane protein with probably ten transmembrane domains. It
belongs to family 4 of glycosyl transferases. Homologs of mraY have been found
in  the archaebacteria Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and in Arabidopsis
thaliana.

We developed two patterns for this family of enzyme.  The first one is located
at the  end  of  the  first  cytoplasmic  loop and the beginning of the second
transmembrane domain.  The  second pattern is located in the third cytoplasmic
loop.

-Consensus pattern: [KRA]-x(2)-[TIVK]-P-[ST]-[MGA]-[GA]-G-[LIVSA]-x-[LIVMF](2)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [NHS]-x(2)-[NK]-x-[TINAS]-[DN]-G-[ILVM]-D-G-[LM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: Haemophilus influenzae  rfe,  which
 also belongs to glycosyl transferase family 4.
