* Dynein light chain type 1 signature *
***************************************

Dynein is  a  multisubunit microtubule-dependent motor enzyme that acts as the
force generating  protein  of  eukaryotic  cilia and flagella. The cytoplasmic
isoform of dynein acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of
vesicles and organelles along microtubules.  Dynein is composed of a number of
ATP-binding large subunits, intermediate size subunits and small subunits.

Among the small subunits, there is a family [1,2] of highly conserved proteins
which consist of:

  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar outer arm dynein 8 Kd and 11 Kd  light
    chains.
  - Higher eukaryotes cytoplasmic dynein light chain 1.
  - Yeast cytoplasmic dynein light chain 1 (gene DYN2 or SLC1).
  - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical dynein light chains M18.2 and T26A5.9.

These proteins  are  have  from 89 to 120 amino acids. As a signature pattern,
we selected a highly conserved region.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-[IV]-x-G-[KR]-x-F-[GA]-S-x-V-[ST]-[HY]-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
