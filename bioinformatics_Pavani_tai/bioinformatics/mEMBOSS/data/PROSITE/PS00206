* Transferrin-like domain signatures and profile *
**************************************************

The transferrin  family  is  a  group  of  glycosylated proteins found in both
vertebrates and  invertebrates.  Included in this group are molecules known to
bind iron,  including  serotransferrin,  ovotransferrin, lactotransferrin, and
melanotransferrin (MTF).  Additional  members of this family include inhibitor
of carbonic  anhydrase  (ICA;  mammals),  major  yolk  protein  (sea urchins),
saxiphilin (frog),  pacifastin  (crayfish),  and  TTF-1  (algae).  Most family
members contain  two  transferrin-like  domains of around 340 amino acids, the
result of an ancient duplication event [1]. Each of the duplicated domains can
be further  divided  into two subdomains that form a cleft inside of which the
iron atom  is bound in iron-transporting transferrin (see <PDB:1LFH>) [2]. The
iron-coordinating residues  consist  of  an aspartic acid, two tyrosines and a
histidine, as  well  as  an  arginine  that  coordinates a requisite anion. In
addition to  iron  and  anion  liganding residues, the transferrin-like domain
contains conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation.

Some proteins known to contain a transferrin-like domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  blood  serotransferrin  (siderophilin).  It functions to deliver
   iron to  cells  via a receptor-mediated endocytic process as well to remove
   toxic free  iron  from the blood and to provide an anti-bacterial, low-iron
   environment.
 - Mammalian   milk   lactotransferrin  (lactoferrin).  It  has  antimicrobial
   activity and contributes to innate immunity by limiting the availability of
   iron to  pathogenic  organisms.  In  addition,  lactoferrin appears to be a
   serine protease  of  the peptidase S60 family [E1] with an active site that
   may consist  of  a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad. Lactoferrin cleaves the putative
   Haemophilus influenzae  colonization  factors IgA1 protease and Hap adhesin
   at homologous arginine-rich sequences [3].
 - Vertebrate  egg  white  ovotransferrin  (conalbumin). Its major function is
   thought to  be  keeping  the  iron  concentration  low  in bodily fluids to
   prevent invading bacteria from acquiring iron.
 - Mammalian membrane-associated melanotransferrin. It was first identified in
   human skin  cells  but now is known to be expressed across a broad range of
   tissue types,  and  is of unknown function. It has only a single functional
   iron binding site located in its N-terminal domain.
 - Porcine  inhibitor  of  carbonic anhydrase (ICA). It specifically binds and
   inhibits carbonic  anhydrase  2  with  nanomolar affinity but does not bind
   iron with high affinity [4].
 - Bull  frog  saxiphilin,  a  plasma  protein  that  binds saxitoxin (STX), a
   causative agent   of  paralytic  shellfish  poisoning.  STX  binds  to  the
   C-terminal transferrin-like    domain   of   saxiphilin.   The   N-terminal
   transferrin-like domain  includes  an  insert  that  represent  two  tandem
   thyroglobulin domains.  Unlike  transferrins, saxiphilin does not bind iron
   [5].
 - Sea  urchin  toposome  or  major  yolk  protein  (MYP), a modified calcium-
   binding, iron-less transferrin essential for cell adhesion and development.
   The protein lacks most of the five iron-binding amino acids D, Y, R, Y, and
   H present at specific positions in iron-transporting transferrins, which is
   consistent with  the  Ca(2+)-binding  function  of  the  toposome  in  cell
   adhesion rather  than  transport.  The  toposome  polypeptide  contains  an
   insertion of some 280 amino acids in the second transferrin-like [6].
 - Crayfish  pacifastin,  an  iron-binding  serine  proteinase inhibitor. This
   protein is a heterodimeric protein, consisting of one proteinase inhibitory
   light chain,  and  one  heavy chain related to transferrins. The pacifastin
   heavy chain  contains  three transferrin-like domains, two of which seem to
   be active for iron binding [7].
 - Green  algae  Dunaliella  salina  TTF-1.  The  membrane associated TTF-1 is
   distinctly different  in  encompassing three, rather than two, transferrin-
   like domains [8].

We have   developed   three  different  signature  patterns  for  iron-binding
transferrin-like domains.  Each of them is centered on one of the iron-binding
residue, respectively the two tyrosines and the histidine. We also developed a
profile which covers the entire transferrin-like domain.
