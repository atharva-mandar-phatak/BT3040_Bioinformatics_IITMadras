******************************************************

High  potential  iron-sulfur proteins (HiPIP) [1,2,E1] are a specific class of
high-redox  potential  4Fe-4S ferredoxins that functions in anaerobic electron
transport  and  which occurs commonly in purple photosynthetic bacteria and in
other bacteria, such as Paracoccus denitrificans and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans
[3]. HiPIPs seem to react by oxidation of [4Fe-4S]2+ to [4Fe-4S]3+.

The  HiPIPs  are  small  proteins  which  show  significant variation in their
sequences,  their  sizes  (from 63 to 85 amino acids), and in their oxidation-
reduction  potentials . As shown in the following schematic representation the
iron-sulfur cluster is bound by four conserved cysteine residues.
