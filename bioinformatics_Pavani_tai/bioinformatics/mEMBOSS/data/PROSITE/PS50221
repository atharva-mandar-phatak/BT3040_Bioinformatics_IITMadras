* GPS domain profile *
**********************

The  GPS  domain  is  a cysteine-rich domain of about 75 amino acid, which was
identified in a number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including CIRLs/
latrophilins  and  in  other  membrane-associated proteins like the sea urchin
receptor  for  egg  jelly protein (REJ). The GPS domain is located immediately
N-terminal  to transmembrane region (TMRs). For the CIRL-1, CIRL-2, CIRL-3 and
CD-97   proteins,   it  has  been  shown  that  they  are  each  made  of  two
non-covalently  bound  subunits  resulting  from  the  endogenous  proteolytic
cleavage  of  a  precursor protein. Because the cysteine-rich domain of CIRL-1
and  possibly  other  receptors  is  involved  in  the  endogenous proteolytic
processing  of  CIRL-1 and possibly other receptors, it has been named GPS for
GPCR  proteolytic  site.  As the amino acids surrounding the putative cleavage
site  are the most conserved residues in the GPS domain, it has been suggested
that all proteins containing it may be cleaved at this position [1,2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a GPS domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian CIRL/latrophilin 1, 2 and 3 (CL1, CL2 and CL3), G-protein-coupled
   receptors performing   a   general  and  ubiquitous  function  in  cellular
   signaling. These  multidomain  proteins  also  contain  a  SUEL-type lectin
   domain (see <PDOC50228>),
 - Mammalian   GPCRs   Emr1,   Emr2   and  Emr3,  which  contain  EGF  domains
   (see <PDOC00021>).
 - Mammalian  polycystin-1  (PKD-1),  a  plasma-membrane  protein.  In  human,
   defects in  PKD1  are  the  cause  of  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
   disease (ADPKD),  a common autosomal dominant genetic disease, the cardinal
   manifestations of   which  are  renal  and  liver  cysts  and  intracranial
   aneurysm.
 - Mammalian MEGF2, a type I membrane protein of the cadherin family.
 - Human  brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) 1, 2 and 3, GPCRs, which
   contain thrombospondin type I repeats (TSP1) (see <PDOC50092>).
 - Human  leucocyte  antigen CD97. It could be a receptor potentially involved
   in both adhesion and signaling processes early after leukocyte activation.
 - Purple  sea urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly (REJ). This type I membrane
   protein induces the acrosome reaction.

The profile we have developed covers the entire GPS domain.
