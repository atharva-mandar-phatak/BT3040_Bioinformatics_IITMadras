* Myelin P0 protein signature *
*******************************

The P0 protein is a major  structural  glycoprotein  of the peripheral nervous
system (PNS) myelin which  probably  plays an important role for the formation
and the maintenance of myelin structure [1,2,3].

P0 is a protein of about  28 Kd  that  consists of three domains: a N-terminal
extracellular  domain of  about  125 residues  which   seems  to form a V-type
immunoglobulin domain; a  transmembrane region,   and a cytoplasmic C-terminal
domain of about 70 residues  which  contains many  positively charged residues
and which is a substrate of some serine protein kinases.

P0 is well conserved  across species.  As  a  signature  pattern we selected a
region located in the  C-terminal part of the cytoplasmic domain that contains
many positive charges and serine residues that could be phosphorylated.

-Consensus pattern: S-[KR]-S-x-K-[AG]-x-[SA]-E-K-K-[STA]-K
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
