* Galactoside-binding lectin (galectin) domain profile *
********************************************************

Galectins (also  known  as  galaptins  or  S-lectin)  are a family of proteins
defined by  having at least one characteristic carbohydrate recognition domain
(CRD) with  an  affinity  for  beta-galactosides  and sharing certain sequence
elements. Members  of  the  galectins  family  are  found  in  mammals, birds,
amphibians, fish,  nematodes,  sponges, and some fungi. Galectins are known to
carry out  intra-  and extracellular functions through glycoconjugate-mediated
recogntion. From  the  cytosol they may be secreted by non-classical pathways,
but they  may also be targeted to the nucleus or specific sub-cytosolic sites.
Within the  same  peptide  chain  some  galectins  have  a CRD with only a few
additional amino acids, whereas others have two CRDs joined by a link peptide,
and one (galectin-3) has one CRD joined to a different type of domain [1-3].

The galectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) is a beta-sandwich of about
135 amino  acid  (see  <PDB:1HLC>).  The  two  sheets are slightly bent with 6
strands forming  the  concave  side and 5 strands forming the convex side. The
concave side  forms a groove in which carbohydrate is bound, and which is long
enough to hold about a linear tetrasaccharide [1-5].

A number of proteins are known to belong to this family:

 - Galectin-3  (also known as MAC-2 antigen; CBP-35 or IgE-binding protein), a
   35 Kd lectin which  binds  immunoglobulin  E and  which  is composed of two
   domains: a  N-terminal  domain that consist of tandem repeats of a glycine/
   proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal galectin domain.
 - Galectin-4 [6], which is composed of two galectin domains.
 - Galectin-5.
 - Galectin-7 [7], a keratinocyte protein which could be involved in cell-cell
   and/or cell-matrix interactions necessary for normal growth control.
 - Galectin-8 [8], which is composed of two galectin domains.
 - Galectin-9 [9], which is composed of two galectin domains.
 - Human eosinophil lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5) [5] (Charcot-Leyden crystal
   protein), a   protein  that  may  have  both  an  enzymatic  and  a  lectin
   activities. It   forms   hexagonal  bipyramidal  crystals  in  tissues  and
   secretions from sites of eosinophil-associated inflammation.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  32  Kd lactose-binding lectin [10]. This lectin is
   composed of two galectin domains.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans lec-7 and lec-8.

The profile we developed covers the entire galectin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
