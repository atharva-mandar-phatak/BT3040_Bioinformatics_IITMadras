* PRELI/MSF1 domain profile *
*****************************

The PRELI/MSF1  domain  is an eukaryotic protein module which occurs in stand-
alone form  in  several  proteins,  including  the human PRELI protein and the
yeast MSF1 protein, and as an amino-terminal domain in an orthologous group of
proteins typified by human SEC14L1, which is conserved in all animals. In this
group of  proteins,  the  PRELI/MSF1  domain co-occurs with the CRAL-TRIO (see
<PDOC50191>) and  the GOLD domains (see <PDOC50866>). The PRELI/MSF1 domain is
approximately 170  residues long and is predicted to assume a globular alpha +
beta fold  with six beta strands and four alpha helices. It has been suggested
that the  PRELI/MSF1  domain  may  have  a  function  associated with cellular
membrane [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire PRELI/MSF1 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2003 / First entry.
