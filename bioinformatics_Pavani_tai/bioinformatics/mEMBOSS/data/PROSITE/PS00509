* Ras GTPase-activating proteins signature and profile *
********************************************************

Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that  bind GTP and GDP
and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP [1].  This intrinsic GTPase activity of ras is
stimulated by a family of proteins  collectively  known  as  'GAP'  or GTPase-
activating proteins [2,3]. As it is the GTP bound form of ras which is active,
these proteins    are  said  to  be  down-regulators of ras. Proteins known to
possess such activity are listed below:

 - Mammalian GAP (p120GAP). GAP can down-regulate wild-type ras, but  fails to
   do so with oncogenic, mutated ras.
 - IRA1 and IRA2, the functional equivalents of  GAP in yeast.  They  regulate
   the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway, controlling cell growth.
 - sar1, the fission yeast protein that regulates ras1 in that organism.
 - BUD2/CLA2,  a yeast protein that activates BUD1/RSR1 and which participates
   in the regulation of bud-site selection [4].
 - Neurofibromin  (gene  NF1)  [5].  In  Man,  NF1  is  associated with type 1
   neurofibromatosis, one  of the  most  frequently inherited genetic diseases
   characterized, in  part,  by multiple neural tumors.  NF1  has  been  shown
   genetically and biochemically  to  interact with  and  stimulate the GTPase
   activity of h-ras.
 - Drosophila  Gap1  [6],  which acts as a negative regulator of signalling by
   the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase involved in eye development.
 - Mammalian Gap1m [7], which is related to the drosophila Gap1 protein.
 - Human  IQGAP1  [8],  a  sar1-related  protein  that  also contains putative
   calmodulin binding sites.

All the above proteins are quite large  (from  765  residues  for sar1 to 3079
residues for IRA2)  but  share  only  a limited (about 250 residues) region of
sequence similarity,  referred  to as the 'catalytic domain' or rasGAP domain.
The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which
seems to  be  characteristic  of this family of proteins [2]. A more sensitive
detection of the rasGAP domain is available through the use of a profile which
spans the whole conserved region.

-Consensus pattern: [GSNA]-x-[LIVMF]-[FYCI]-[LIVMFY]-R-[LIVMFY](2)-[GACNS]-
                    [PAV]-[AV]-[LIV]-[LIVM]-[SGANT]-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 22.

-Note: There are distinctly different GAPs for the rap and rho/rac subfamilies
 of ras-like proteins (reviewed in reference [9]) that  do  not share sequence
 similarity with ras GAPs.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
