* Zinc finger SBP-type profile *
********************************

SQUAMOSA   promoter   binding   proteins   (SBPs)   form  a  major  family  of
plant-specific transcription factors related to flower development. They share
a  highly  conserved  DNA-binding domain that contains two zinc-binding sites.
Among the 11 possible ligands for the zinc atoms that are conserved in the SBP
zinc  finger, only 8 are used. The SBP zinc finger follows the general pattern
C-x4-C-x16-C-x2-[HC]-x15-C-x2-C-x3-H-x11-C.  Three  other  histidines are well
conserved but not involved in zinc binding [1,2].

In  vitro  experiments  show that the SBP zinc finger preferentially binds the
consensus   sequence   -TNCGTACAA-  [3].  However,  little  is  known  of  the
physiological  functions  of  these putative transcriptional regulators beyond
their ability to bind DNA.

The solution structure of the SBP zinc finger has been solved (see <PDB:1UL4>)
[2].  The  first  four  Cys  or  His coordinate one zinc ion and the last four
coordinate  the  other.  It  can  be viewed as two structural subdomains, each
subdomain  containing  a  single zinc-binding pocket. The N-terminal subdomain
consists  of  two  short  alpha  helices whereas the C-terminal one contains a
three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
