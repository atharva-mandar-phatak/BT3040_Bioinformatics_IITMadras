* N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases signature *
**************************************************

N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases (EC 2.1.1.113) [1,2,3]  are  enzymes that
specifically  methylate  the  amino  group at the C-4 position of cytosines in
DNA. Such enzymes are found as components of type II  restriction-modification
systems in prokaryotes.  Such enzymes recognize a specific sequence in DNA and
methylate a cytosine in that sequence.    By this action they protect DNA from
cleavage by type II restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence.

Type II N-4 Mtases seem to be  structurally  and  enzymatically related to N-6
adenine-specific DNA methylases.  Like the N-6 Mtases they contain a conserved
Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe region,  but the N- and C-terminal contexts of this region are
sufficiently different  to derive a consensus pattern specific to this type of
enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-T-S-P-P-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.
