* Ets-domain signatures and profile *
*************************************

Avian leukemia virus E26 is a replication defective  retrovirus that induces a
mixed erythroid/myeloid leukemia in chickens.  E26 virus  carries two distinct
oncogenes, v-myb and v-ets.  The ets portion  of this oncogene is required for
the induction of erythroblastosis. V-ets and c-ets-1, its cellular progenitor,
have been shown [1] to be nuclear DNA-binding proteins. Ets-1 differs slightly
from v-ets at its carboxy-terminal region.   In most species where it has been
sequenced, c-ets-1   exists  in  various  isoforms  generated  by  alternative
splicing and differential phosphorylation.

A number  of  proteins,  that  share regions of similarity with v-ets/c-ets-1,
have been found and are listed below:

 - Ets-2,  which  has  been   sequenced  in  mammals,  chicken,  Xenopus   and
   Drosophila.
 - Human ELF-1, a transcription factor that appears to be  required for the T-
   cell-receptor-mediated trans activation of HIV-2 genes.
 - Mammalian   ELK-1, ELK-3 (also known as Net or SAP-2) and ELK-4 (also known
   as SRF  accessory protein 1 (SAP-1)), which all form a ternary complex with
   the serum response factor (SRF).
 - Human  ERF, a potent transcriptional repressor that binds to the HI element
   of the Ets-2 promoter.
 - Human ERG.
 - Human ERM.
 - Mammalian ETV1, a transcriptional activator.
 - FLI-1, a sequence specific transcriptional activator.
 - Adenovirus E1A enhancer-binding protein (E1A-F) (ETV4) (PEA3).
 - PU.1 (also known as Spi-1), a protein that binds to a purine-rich sequence,
   the PU-box, that can act as a lymphoid-specific enhancer.  PU.1 is probably
   a transcriptional  activator  that  may  be  specifically  involved  in the
   differentiation or activation of macrophages or B cells. In mouse, Spi-1 is
   an oncogene involved in murine acute friend erythroleukemia.
 - Spi-B, a transcription factor that binds the PU-box.
 - GA binding protein (GAPB) alpha subunit.  GAPB  is  a  transcription factor
   capable of interacting with purine-rich repeats (GA repeats).
 - Drosophila protein elg-1.
 - Drosophila  protein  pokkuri (pok) (also known as yan), which is a negative
   regulator of photoreceptor development.
 - Drosophila  protein pointed (pnt) which is required for glial-neuronal cell
   interactions.
 - Drosophila ecdysone induced protein 74E.

All these  proteins  contain  a  conserved domain, the 'ETS-domain', [2,3,4,5]
involved in    DNA-binding. It seems to  recognize  purine-rich sequences [5].
This domain, of about 85 to 90 amino acids, is rich in aromatic and positively
charged residues.  It is generally localized at the C-terminus of the protein,
with the  exception of ELF-1, ELK-1, ELK-3, ELK-4 and ERF where it is found at
the N-terminus.

We have derived two signature patterns for the ETS-domain.  The  first  one is
based on a highly conserved region in the N-terminal part of the domain, while
the second is based on a region in the second third of the domain. The profile
spans the complete domain.
