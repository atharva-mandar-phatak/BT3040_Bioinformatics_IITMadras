* HxlR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  hxlR-type  HTH  domain  is  a  domain  of  ~90-100 amino acids present in
putative  transcription  regulators  with  a  winged  helix-turn-helix  (wHTH)
structure.  The  domain is named after Bacillus subtilis hxlR, a transcription
activator  of  the hxlAB operon involved in the detoxification of formaldehyde
[1].  The hxlR-type domain forms the core of putative transcription regulators
and  of  hypothetical  proteins occurring in eubacteria as well as in archaea.
The  sequence  and  structure of hxlR-type proteins show similarities with the
marR-type wHTH (see <PDOC00861>) [2].

The  crystal  structure  of  ytfH  resembles the DNA-binding domains of winged
helix  proteins  (see  <PDB:1YYV>),  containing a three helix (H) bundle and a
three-stranded     antiparallel    beta-sheet    (B)    in    the    topology:
H1-H2-B1-H3-H4-B2-B3-H5-H6.   This  topology  corresponds  with  that  of  the
marR-type   DNA-binding   domain,   wherein  helices  3  and  4  comprise  the
helix-turn-helix motif and the beta-sheet is called the wing.

Some proteins known to contain a hxlR-type HTH domain:

 - Bacillus  subtilis  hxlR,  a  transcription  activator  for  enzymes of the
   ribulose monophosphate pathway, which can be induced by formaldehyde.
 - Escherichia  coli and Salmonella typhimurium ytfH, a hypothetical protein.
 - Fusobacterium  mortiferum  malR,  a potential regulator of the malBH operon
   involved in the metabolism of sucrose isomers [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire hxlR-type HTH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
