* R3H domain profile *
**********************

The R3H  domain is a conserved sequence motif found in proteins from a diverse
range of  organisms  including  eubacteria,  green  plants,  fungi and various
groups of  metazoans,  but not in archaea and Escherichia coli. The R3H domain
contains  an  invariant  arginine  and  a highly conserved histidine, that are
separated  by  three  residues.  It  also  displays  a  conserved  pattern  of
hydrophobic  residues,  prolines  and  glycines.  It  can  be  found alone, in
association  with AAA domain (see <PDOC00572>) or with various DNA/RNA binding
domains  like DSRM, KH, G-patch (see <PDOC50174>), PHD (see <PDOC50016>), DEAD
box (see  <PDOC00039>),  or  RRM  (see  <PDOC00030>).  The  functions of these
domains indicate  that  the  R3H  domain  might be involved in polynucleotide-
binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA [1].

The  3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved (see <PDB:1MSZ>). The fold
presents a  small  motif,  consisting  of  a three-stranded antiparallel beta-
sheet, against  which  two  alpha-helices  pack  from  one  side. This fold is
related to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of the
translational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster on
the  same  face  of  the  R3H  domain  and  could  play a role in nucleic acid
recognition. An extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecular
surface could act as a protein-binding site [2].

Proteins currently known to contain an R3H domain are:

 - Mammalian SMB2-related proteins, which are involved in DNA-binding, and are
   specific  to  a  5'-phosphorylated  single-stranded  guanine-rich  sequence
   related to the immunoglobulin mu chain switch region.
 - Bacterial JAG proteins.
 - Mammalian R3H domain protein 1.

The profile developed covers the entire R3H structure.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
