* UmuC domain profile *
***********************

In Escherichia  coli,  UV  and many chemicals appear to cause mutagenesis by a
process of  translesion  synthesis  that  requires  DNA polymerase III and the
SOS-regulated proteins   umuC,   umuD  and  recA.  This  machinery  allow  the
replication to  continue  through  DNA  lesion,  and  therefore  avoid  lethal
interruption of DNA replication after DNA damage [1].

Proteins known to contain an UmuC domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial umuC protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  mucB  and Salmonella typhimurium impB proteins. Plasmid-
   born analogues of the UmuC protein.
 - Salmonella typhimurium samB, a plasmid associated homologue of UmuC .
 - Bacterial DNA polymerase IV.
 - Yeast REV1 protein,  required for normal induction of mutations by physical
   and chemical agents.

The profile we developed spans the complete UmuC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: September 2002 / First entry.
