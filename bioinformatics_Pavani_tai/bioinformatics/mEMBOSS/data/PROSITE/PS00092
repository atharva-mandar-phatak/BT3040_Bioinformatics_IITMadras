* N-6 Adenine-specific DNA methylases signature *
*************************************************

N-6 adenine-specific DNA  methylases (EC 2.1.1.72) (A-Mtase) are  enzymes that
specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA.
Such enzymes are  found  in the three existing types of bacterial restriction-
modification systems  (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM
gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). All of these enzymes
recognize  a  specific  sequence  in  DNA  and  methylate  an  adenine in that
sequence.

It has been  shown [1,2,3,4] that A-Mtases contain  a conserved motif Asp/Asn-
Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal  section,  this conserved  region could be
involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity.  We have derived a
pattern from that motif.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMAC]-[LIVFYWA]-{DYP}-[DN]-P-P-[FYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for m.HhaII where the second Pro is  replaced  by  Gln and in m.HindIII where
 that same Pro is replaced by Tyr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 33 different proteins that are most
 probably not A-Mtases, and three hypothetical Escherichia coli  proteins that
 could be A-Mtases.

-Note: N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases,  which are probably enzymatically
 related to A-Mtases,  also  include  a  conserved  Pro-Pro  dipeptide but the
 residues around them are  sufficiently different to allow the derivation of a
 pattern specific to these enzymes.
