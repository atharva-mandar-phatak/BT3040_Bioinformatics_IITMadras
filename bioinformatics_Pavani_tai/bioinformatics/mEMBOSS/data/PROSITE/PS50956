* AsnC-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  asnC-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  60  amino  acids  present  in  transcription regulators of the asnC/lrp
family.  This family of prokaryotic regulators is named after Escherichia coli
asnC and Leucine-responsive Regulatory Protein (lrp), which are a regulator of
asparagine  synthesis  and a global regulator of various operons, respectively
[1].  AsnC/lrp-like  proteins  are  present  in  bacteria and archaea [2]. The
DNA-binding  asnC-type  HTH  domain occurs usually in the N-terminal part. The
C-terminal   part   can   contain   an   effector-binding   domain  and/or  an
oligomerization  domain.  Regulators  of  the  asnC/lrp  family can be dimers,
tetramers, octamers and hexadecamers [3,4]. These proteins regulate amino acid
metabolism  and  related  processes.  Lrp  is  a  global regulator of E. coli,
involved   in   amino   acid   metabolism  and  pili  synthesis  by  affecting
transcription  of  at least 10% of its genes. Most lrp homologues appear to be
specific  regulators  of amino acid metabolism [4]. Various amino acids act as
specific  effectors  and  can  either  activate  or  repress  transcription of
metabolic  enzymes.  Many  asnC/lrp-like  proteins  can also repress their own
expression [4,5,6].

The  crystal  structure  of  hyperthermophilic  archaeal  lrpA  shows that the
N-terminal,  DNA  binding  domain  contains  a  core  of  three alpha-helices,
followed  by  a  single beta-strand, which connects as a flexible hinge to the
effector  binding  domain  (see  <PDB:1I1G>).  The  second  and third helices,
connected  via  a turn, comprise the helix-turn-helix motif. Helix 3 is termed
the  recognition  helix  as it binds the DNA major groove, like in other HTHs.
Most  E.  coli lrp DNA binding mutants are positioned in the lrpA structure on
the HTH and three are on the hinge [3].

Some proteins known to contain an asnC-type HTH domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  Leucine-responsive  Regulatory  Protein  (lrp), a global
   transcriptional  regulator  of 35-75 different genes involved in amino acid
   biosynthesis,  amino acid degradation, transport or pili formation. Binding
   of  leucine  by  lrp  can  stimulate  or  reduce  the  regulatory effect of
   activation  for  some  operons  or  repression  for  others. Lrp negatively
   autoregulates the lrp gene, independently of leucine.
 - Salmonella  typhimurium lrp, a global leucine-responsive regulator involved
   in  branched-chain  amino  acid  biosynthesis,  pili  formation and plasmid
   virulence.
 - Escherichia  coli  asnC,  a  specific  asparagine-dependent transcriptional
   activator of   asparagine   biosynthesis.   AsnC  is  also  an  asparagine-
   independent repressor of its own transcription.
 - Pseudomonas   putida   bkdR,   a  specific  autoregulatory  transcriptional
   regulator, involved in catabolism of branched-chain amino acids.
 - Agrobacterium  tumefaciens putR, a specific proline-responsive regulator of
   proline catabolism.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  lrpA/lrpB and lrpC, transcriptional regulators involved
   in  serine-glycine  interconversion, sporulation and amino acid metabolism.
   LrpC binds to a specific DNA structure and wraps and overwinds the DNA [7].
 - Bacillus  subtilis  azlB, a specific transcriptional repressor of branched-
   chain amino acid transport.
 - Pyrococcus furiosus lrpA, a putative lrp with negative autoregulation.
 - Zymomonas mobilis grp, a repressor of the glutamate uptake operon.

The   pattern   we   use   to   detect   these  proteins  spans  the  complete
helix-turn-helix  motif and extends one residue downstream and one upstream of
the  HTH extremities. The profile we developed covers the entire asnC-type DNA
binding domain, from the first helix to the end of the hinge.
