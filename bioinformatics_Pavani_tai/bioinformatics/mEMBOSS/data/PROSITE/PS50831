* SoHo domain profile *
***********************

The c-Cbl-associated  protein  (CAB),  ArgBP2  and  vinexin-alpha each contain
three C-terminal  SH3  domains (see <PDOC50002>) and an N-terminal region with
similarity to the gut peptide sorbin, termed the sorbin homology (SoHo) domain
[1,2,3]. Whereas  the  SH3  domains  of  these  proteins can bind to different
signaling or  cytoskeletal  molecules, the SoHo domains of CAP and vinexin has
been shown  to  interact  specifically  with the lipid raft-associated protein
flotilin. Thus  these  proteins  serve  as  adapters  that  link  signaling or
cytoskeletal proteins  to the lipid raft, a microdomain of the plasma membrane
enriched in  cholesterol and sphingolipids that concentrates certain signaling
molecules [4].

The profile  we  developed  covers the region of the SoHo domain necessary for
the interaction with flotilin.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
