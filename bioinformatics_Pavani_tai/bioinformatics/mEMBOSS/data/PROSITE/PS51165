* THUMP domain profile *
************************

The THUMP  (after  thiouridine  synthases,  RNA  methylases  and pseudouridine
synthases) domain is a module of 100-110 amino acid residues which is involved
RNA metabolism.  It  is  shared  by enzymes that are predicted to carry out at
least three   unrelated   types   of   RNA-modification,  namely  methylation,
pseudouridylation and  thiouridylation.  The  THUMP domain can occur in stand-
alone form  or  in  association  with  a  variety  of  catalytic domains, like
methylase, pseudo  U-synthase  or  rhodanese  (see  <PDOC00322>).  THUMP is an
ancient domain  with predicted RNA-binding capacity that probably functions by
delivering a  variety  of RNA modification enzymes to their targets. The THUMP
domain apparently  evolved prior to the divergence of the primary divisions of
life [1].

The THUMP  domain  has  been  predicted to adopt an alpha/beta fold similar to
that found  in  the  C-terminal  domain of translation initiation factor 3 and
ribosomal protein S8 [1].

Some proteins known to contain a THUMP domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial and archaeal thiI-like 4-thiouridine synthases.
 - Bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic RNA methylases.
 - Archaeal pseudouridine synthases (PSUSs).
 - Several uncharacterized proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire THUMP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 2005 / First entry.
