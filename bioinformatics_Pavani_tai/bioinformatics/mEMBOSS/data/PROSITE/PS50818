Inteins  (for  INternal  proTEINs)  are  protein  insertion sequences that are
embedded in host protein sequences. They are post-translationally excised from
the  host  protein  by a self-catalytic protein splicing process, in which the
intein  sequence is precisely excised, and the flanking host protein sequences
(N-  and  C-exteins)  are religated to create a functional protein. Intein and
protein  splicing  may  be  viewed as the protein equivalent of intron and RNA
splicing,  respectively.  Inteins  were  initially  discovered  as  translated
intervening  sequences  that  were  present  in  the  host  gene but absent in
homologous  genes.  Inteins  occur in organisms spanning all three kingdoms of
life  (eubacteria,  archaea  and eukaryote). Although many inteins are in host
proteins  involved  in nucleic acid metabolism, several inteins are located in
metabolic   enzymes,   such   as   phosphoenolpyruvate   synthase,   anaerobic
ribonucleoside   triphosphate   reductase,   UDP-glucose  dehydrogenase,  ClpP
protease/chaperone,  vacuolar  ATPase proton pump (VMA) and glutamine-fructose
6-phosphate  transaminase.  It  should be noted that protein splicing can also
occur  in  trans  as  in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, where the replicative DNA
polymerase  catalytic  subunit (DnaE) is generated from two separate precursor
fragments [1,2,3,4,E1].

Most inteins are bifunctional proteins mediating both protein splicing and DNA
cleavage. The  domain  involved  in  splicing  is  formed  by the two terminal
splicing  regions,  which are separated by a small linker in mini-inteins or a
homing endonuclease of 200-250 amino acids in larger inteins (see <PDOC50819>)
[1,4].  The  N-terminal  splicing  region spans the about 100 N-terminal amino
acids  and  contains  the conserved intein blocks A and B which are similar to
the motifs  found  in  the  C-terminal  autoprocessing  domain of the hedgehog
protein.  The  C-terminal  splicing  region  is  composed of the two conserved
blocks  F  and  G located in the about 50 C-terminal amino acids. Although, no
single  residue  is invariant, the Ser and Cys in block A, the His in block B,
the His, Asn and Ser/Cys/Thr in block G are the most conserved residues in the
splicing  motifs.  Protein  splicing  requires neither cofactors nor auxiliary
enzymes  and  involves  a  series  of  four  intramolecular reactions in which
several of these most conserved residues are implicated [1,3,E1].

Resolution of   the  crystal  structure  of  the  Mxe  GyrA  mini-intein  (see
<PDB:1AM2>) revealed a flattened 'horseshoe shaped' protein composed primarily
of beta-strands forming two homologous subdomains that are related by a pseudo
twofold axis  of  symmetry.  Despite a low level of sequence conservation, the
two subdomains  are  nearly  superimposable,  suggesting  that they could have
arisen by  tandem  duplication  of  a primordial gene. However, the duplicated
sequences do  not  correspond  directly  to  the  two  subdomains  as  the two
subdomains have exchanged homologous loop regions [1,2,5,6].

The  first  profile  we  have  developed  is  directed  against the N-terminal
splicing region and covers the intein blocks A and B. It starts with the first
N-terminal amino acid of the intein.

The  second  profile  we  have  developed  is  directed against the C-terminal
splicing  region and covers the intein blocks F and G. It extends to the first
extein residue following the intein.
