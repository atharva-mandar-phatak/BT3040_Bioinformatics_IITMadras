***********************************************

Seminal vesicle  protein  I (SVP-1)  [1]  is one  of  the four major secretory
proteins secreted by guinea-pig seminal vesicle epithelium.   It is a clotting
protein that serves as the substrate in the  formation of the copulatory plug.
Covalent  clotting of this  protein  is catalyzed  by a  transglutaminase  and
involves   the formation of  gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinks.   SVP-1
sequence contains eight  repeats of a  twenty four amino acid  residue domain.
There are seven  invariant  residues  in these  repeats,  three  of  them (two
lysines  and  one glutamine)  probably  participate  in  the cross-links.  The
pattern we have  developed comprises  positions  1 to  19 of  the  domain  and
includes the three cross-linking residues.

This pattern  is  also  present  twice [2] in  the  N-terminal  region  of the
precursor of  human  skin  elafin,  an inhibitor of elastase as well as in the
precursor of pig sodium/potassium atpase inhibitor SPAI-2.

-Consensus pattern: [IVM]-x-G-Q-D-x-V-K-x(5)-[KN]-G-x(3)-[STLV]
                    [Q and K are involved in covalent cross-links]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
