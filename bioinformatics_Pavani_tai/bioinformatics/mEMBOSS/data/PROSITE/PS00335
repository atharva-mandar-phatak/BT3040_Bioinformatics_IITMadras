* Parathyroid hormone family signature *
****************************************

Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  is  a  polypeptidic  hormone  that elevates calcium
level  by  dissolving  the salts in bone and preventing their renal excretion.
PTH is a protein of about 80 amino acid  residues, but its biological activity
seems to be contained within the first 34 residues.

PTH is structurally related  to  a protein called 'parathyroid hormone-related
protein' (PTH-rP) [1]  which seems to play a  physiological role in lactation,
possibly as a hormone  for the  mobilization and/or transfer of calcium to the
milk.  PTH-rP is  a  protein  of  141  amino  acids.  As for PTH, the first 34
residues are sufficient to mediate the biological activity of PTH-rP.  PTH and
PTH-rP bind to the same G-protein coupled receptor.

The signature pattern we selected for these proteins is derived from conserved
residues in the N-terminal extremity of PTH and PTH-rP, spanning residues 2 to
12.

-Consensus pattern: V-S-E-x-Q-x(2)-H-x(2)-G
