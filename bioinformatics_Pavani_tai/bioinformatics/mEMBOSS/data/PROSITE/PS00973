* Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases family 2 signatures/profile *
**********************************************************************

Ubiquitin  carboxyl-terminal  hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.15) (UCH) (deubiquitinating
enzymes) [1,2] are thiol proteases  that recognize  and  hydrolyze the peptide
bond at the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. These enzymes are involved in the
processing of  poly-ubiquitin  precursors  as  well  as  that  of  ubiquinated
proteins.

There are  two  distinct  families  of  UCH. The second class consist of large
proteins (800 to 2000 residues) and is currently represented by:

 - Yeast UBP1, UBP2, UBP3, UBP4 (or DOA4/SSV7), UBP5, UBP7, UBP9, UBP10,
   UBP11, UBP12, UBP13, UBP14, UBP15 and UBP16.
 - Human tre-2.
 - Human isopeptidase T.
 - Human isopeptidase T-3.
 - Mammalian Ode-1.
 - Mammalian Unp.
 - Mouse Dub-1.
 - Drosophila fat facets protein (gene faf).
 - Mammalian faf homolog.
 - Drosophila D-Ubp-64E.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R10E11.3.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K02C4.3.

These proteins only share two regions of similarity. The first region contains
a conserved cysteine which is probably implicated  in the catalytic mechanism.
The second region contains two conserved histidines residues,  one of which is
also probably  implicated  in  the  catalytic  mechanism.  We  have  developed
signature pattern  for  both  conserved  regions.  We also developed a profile
including the two regions covered by the patterns.

-Consensus pattern: G-[LIVMFY]-x(1,3)-[AGCY]-[NASMQG]-x-C-[FYWC]-[LIVMFCA]-
                    [NSTAD]-[SACV]-x-[LIVMSF]-[QF]
                    [C may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for two sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [YMF]-x-[LK]-x-[SAGNC]-[LIVMFT]-x(2)-H-x-G-x(4,6)-G-H-
                    [YF]
                    [The 2 H's may be active site residues]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family C19 in the classification of peptidases
 [3,E1].
