* DSL domain profile *
**********************

The  about  50  amino  acids  DSL  (Delta  /  Serrate  /  Lag-2)  domain is an
extracellular  domain  essential  to  activate  members  of  the  Lin-12/Notch
receptors  family. The DSL domain may mediates oligomerization of DSL proteins
to  form  an  active  ligand  and  mediates interaction with the extracellular
domain  of  Lin-12/Notch proteins involved in cell-cell signaling interactions
[1,2,3].  The  DSL  domain  is found followed by a variable number of tandemly
repeated  copies  of EGF motifs (see <PDOC00021>). Like EGF motifs this domain
contains   six   conserved  cysteines  spanning  different  sequence  lengths.
Furthermore, the DSL domain contains a conserved YYG motif not present in  the
EGF motifs.

The DSL  domain  has  clear  structural  similarities to an EGF domain, with a
double-stranded antiparallel     beta-sheet    immediately    preceding    the
characteristic loop between the final disulfide-bonded cysteines residues (see
<PDB:2VJ2>). However, the DSL domain adopts a fold with a different disulfide-
bonded pattern  (C1-C2,  C3-C4,  C5-C6). On the basis of the structure, it has
been proposed  that  the  DSL domain may have evolved from a truncation of two
tandem short EGF domains [4].

Proteins currently known to contain a DSL domain are:

 - The  mammalian  Serrate  proteins,  which  are ligands  for Notch receptors
   essential for the differenciation of certain tissues.
 - The  human  JAG1  and  the Drosophila Delta  proteins. They are ligands for
   multiple  Notch  receptors and  are  involved  in  the  mediation  of Notch
   signaling [5].
 - The  Caenorhabditis elegans lag-2/Apx1 proteins which are signaling ligands
   for the glp-1 and lin-12 receptors [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire DSL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
