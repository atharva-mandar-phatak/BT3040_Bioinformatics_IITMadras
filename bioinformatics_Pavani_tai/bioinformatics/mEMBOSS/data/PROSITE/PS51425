* Stromalin conservative (SCD) domain profile *
***********************************************

The stromal  antigens  or  stromalins  are a group of highly conserved nuclear
proteins, originally  identified from a murine bone marrows stromal cell line.
Stromalins are  represented  in several organisms from yeast to humans and are
characterized by  the  stromalin  conservative  domain (SCD), an 86 amino acid
motif found in all proteins of the family described to date [1].

Some proteins known to contain a SCD domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate cohesin subunits SA-1, -2 and -3 (Stag1, 2 and 3), components of
   cohesin complex,  a  complex required for the cohesion of sister chromatids
   after DNA replication.
 - Human STAG3-like protein.
 - Yeast  cohesin  subunit  SCC3,  a  component  of cohesin complex, a complex
   required for the cohesion of sister chromatids after DNA replication.
 - Fission yeast meiotic recombination protein rec11.

The profile we developed covers the entire SCD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
