* K-box domain profile *
************************

MADS genes  in  plants  encode  key developmental regulators of vegetative and
reproductive development.  The  majority  of  the  plant MADS proteins share a
stereotypical MIKC  structure.  It  comprises  (from  N-  to C-terminal) an N-
terminal domain,  which is, however, present only in a minority of proteins; a
MADS domain  (see  <PDOC00302>), which is the major determinant of DNA-binding
but which also performs dimerization and accessory factor binding functions; a
weakly conserved  intervening  (I)  domain,  which constitutes a key molecular
determinant for  the selective formation of DNA-binding dimers; a keratin-like
(K-box) domain,  which  promotes  protein  dimerization;  and a C-terminal (C)
domain, which is involved in transcriptional activation or in the formation of
ternary or  quaternary  protein  complexes. The 80-amino acid K-box domain was
originally identified  as  a  region  with low but significant similarity to a
region of  keratin, which is part of the coiled-coil sequence constituting the
central rod-shaped domain of keratin [1-3].

The K-box protein-protein interaction domain which mediates heterodimerization
of MIKC-type  MADS proteins contains several heptad repeats in which the first
and the  fourth  positions  are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids suggesting
that the K-box domain forms three amphipathic alpha-helices referred to as K1,
K2, and K3 [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire K-box domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
