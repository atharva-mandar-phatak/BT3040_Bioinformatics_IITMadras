* Cornichon family signature *
******************************

The Drosophila  cornichon  protein (gene: cni) [1] is required in the germline
for dorsal-ventral  signaling. The dorsal-ventral pattern formation involves a
reorganization of  the microtubule network correlated with the movement of the
oocyte nucleus,  and  depending  on  the  initial correct establishment of the
anterior-posterior axis  via  a  signal  from the oocyte produced by cornichon
and gurken  and  received  by  torpedo  protein  in  the  follicle  cells. The
biochemical function of the cornichon protein is currently not known.

It is  a  protein  of  144  residues that seems to contain three transmembrane
regions. It is evolutionary related to the following eukaryotic proteins:

 - Yeast  ERV14  [2],  probably  involved  in  regulation of secretory protein
   export.
 - Human and mouse [3] cornichon proteins (gene cnih).
 - Mouse cornichon-like protein (gene cnil).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09E8.3.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR210W.
 - Schizosaccharomyces pombe hypothetical protein SpAC2C4.05.

The high   conservation of this family throughout evolution suggests a role in
basic cellular functions.

As a  signature  for  these proteins we selected a conserved region located in
the loop  between  the  first and second transmembrane regions. This conserved
region contains three acidic residues.
