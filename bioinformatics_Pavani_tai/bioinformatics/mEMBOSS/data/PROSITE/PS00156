****************************************************

Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) (OMPdecase) [1,2] catalyzes
the last step in the de novo  biosynthesis of pyrimidines, the decarboxylation
of OMP  into UMP.  In  higher  eukaryotes  OMPdecase  is  part,  with  orotate
phosphoribosyltransferase, of a bifunctional enzyme, while the prokaryotic and
fungal OMPdecases are monofunctional protein.

Some parts of the sequence of OMPdecase are well conserved across species. The
best conserved region  is  located in the N-terminal half of OMPdecases and is
centered around a lysine residue which is essential for the catalytic function
of the enzyme. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFTAR]-[LIVMF]-x-D-x-K-x(2)-D-[IV]-[ADGP]-x-T-
                    [CLIVMNTA]
                    [K is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2002 / Pattern and text revised.
