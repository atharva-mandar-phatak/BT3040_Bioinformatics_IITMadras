* TEA domain signature and profile *
************************************

The  TEA domain is a DNA-binding region of about 66 to 68 amino acids that has
been  named  after  the two proteins that originally defined the domain: TEF-1
and  abaA  [1].  The  TEA  domain  is  located  toward  the  amino terminus of
eukaryotic  transcription  factors of the TEA/ATTS family . It is predicted to
contain  three  alpha-helices,  two  of  which  have  been  demonstrated to be
important for DNA binding [2].

Some of the proteins that contain a TEA domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian enhancer factor TEF-1. TEF-1 can bind to two  distinct  sequences
   in the SV40 enhancer and is a transcriptional activator.
 - Mammalian  TEF-3,  TEF-4 and TEF-5 [3], putative transcriptional activators
   highly similar to TEF-1.
 - Drosophila scalloped protein (gene sd),  a  probable  transcription  factor
   that functions in the regulation  of cell-specific gene  expression  during
   Drosophila development, particularly  in the differentiation of the nervous
   system [4].
 - Emericella nidulans  regulatory  protein  abaA.  AbaA  is  involved  in the
   regulation  of conidiation (asexual spore);  its expression  leads  to  the
   cessation of vegetative growth.
 - Yeast trans-acting factor TEC1.  TEC1  is involved in the activation of the
   Ty1 retrotransposon.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F28B12.2.

As  a signature pattern, we have used positions 39 to 67 of the TEA domain. We
also developed a profile that covers the whole domain.
