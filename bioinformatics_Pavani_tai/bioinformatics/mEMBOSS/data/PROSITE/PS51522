* Zinc finger nanos-type profile *
**********************************

Nanos is  a  highly  conserved  RNA-binding  protein  in higher eukaryotes and
functions as  a  key  regulatory  protein  in translational control using a 3'
untranslated region  during  the  development  and  maintenance of germ cells.
Nanos comprises  a  non-conserved amino-terminus and highly conserved carboxy-
terminal regions.  The  C-terminal  region  has  two conserved Cys-Cys-His-Cys
(CCHC)-type zinc-finger  motifs  that  are  indispensable  for  nanos function
[1,2,3].

The structure  of  the  nanos-type  zinc finger is composed of two independent
zinc-finger (ZF)  lobes,  the N-terminal ZF1 and the C-terminal ZF2, which are
connected by  a  linker helix (see <PDB:3ALR>) [3]. These lobes create a large
cleft. Zinc  ions  in  ZF1  and ZF2 are bound to the CCHC motif by tetrahedral
coordination.

The profile we developed covers the entire nanos-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
