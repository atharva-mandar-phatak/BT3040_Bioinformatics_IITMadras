* cAMP phosphodiesterases class-II signature *
**********************************************

Cyclic  AMP  phosphodiesterase   (EC 3.1.4.17)  (cAMP-PDEase)   catalyzes  the
hydrolysis of  cAMP to  the  corresponding nucleoside 5' monophosphate.  While
most PDEases can be, on  the  basis of sequence similarities, grouped together
[1], there are at least two enzymes which do not  belong to the main family of
PDEases and which represent a second class of these enzymes [2]:

 - Slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum extracellular cAMP PDEase.  This enzyme
   plays an essential role in  development  by  hydrolyzing the cAMP used as a
   chemoattractant by aggregating cells.
 - Budding yeast and Candida albicans low-affinity cAMP PDEase (gene PDE1).
 - Fission yeast probable cAMP PDEase (gene cgs2).
 - Vibrio fischeri periplasmic cAMP PDEase (gene cpdP) [3].

There is, in the central part of  these enzymes,  a  highly  conserved  region
which contains three histidines.  We  have  used  this  region  as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-H-L-D-H-[LIVM]-x-[GS]-[LIVMA]-[LIVM](2)-x-S-[AP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
