* PAN/apple domain signature and profile *
******************************************

Plasma kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.34) and  coagulation factor XI (EC 3.4.21.27) are
two related plasma serine proteases activated  by  factor XIIA and which share
the same  domain  topology:  an  N-terminal  region  that contains four tandem
repeats of about 90 amino acids and a C-terminal catalytic domain.

The 90 amino-acid repeated domain contains 6 conserved cysteines.  It has been
shown [1,2] that three  disulfide bonds  link the first and sixth,  second and
fifth, and third and fourth cysteines. The domain can be drawn in the shape of
an apple (see below) and has been accordingly called the 'apple domain'.

The  apple domains of plasma prekallikrein are known to mediate its binding to
high  molecular  weight  kininogen [3], the apple domains of factor XI bind to
factor XIIa, platelets, kininogen, factor IX and heparin [4].

The  apple  domain  display  some  sequence  similarity  with  the N domain of
plasminogen/hepatocyte  growth factor (HGF) and to some nematode and protozoan
proteins  [5].  They  all belong to the same domain superfamily that have been
called  the  PAN module [6]. The N domain of hepatocyte growth factor binds to
the  c-Met  receptor  and  to  the  heparin molecule. The structure of the PAN
module  of  HGF has been solved (see <PDB:2HGF>). It contains a characteristic
hairpin-loop  structure  stabilized  by two disulfide bridges, Cys-1 and 6 are
not conserved in HGF PAN modules [7].

Apart  from  the cysteines, there are a number of other conserved positions in
the  apple  domain. We have developed a pattern, that spans the complete apple
domain,  and which includes these conserved positions. The pattern is specific
to  the plasma kalllikrein/coagulation factor XI subgroup. We also developed a
profile  that  recognized all members of the PAN module superfamily and covers
the whole domain.
