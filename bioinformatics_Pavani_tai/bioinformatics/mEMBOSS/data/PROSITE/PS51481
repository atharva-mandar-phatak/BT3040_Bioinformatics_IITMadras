* DhaK domain profile *
***********************

Dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinases are a family of sequence-conserved enzymes that
phosphorylate dihydroxyacetone,  glyceraldehyde  and other short-chain ketoses
and aldoses.  They  can  be divided into two groups according to the source of
high-energy phosphate  that  they  utilize,  either ATP or phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP). The  ATP-dependent  forms  are  the two-domain Dha kinases (DAK), which
occur in animals, plants and eubacteria. They consist of a Dha binding (K) and
an ATP  binding  (L)  (see  <PDOC51480>) domain. The PEP-dependent forms occur
only in eubacteria and a few archaebacteria and consist of three subunits. Two
subunits, DhaK  and DhaL, are homologous to the K and L domains. Intriguingly,
the ADP  moiety  is not exchanged for ATP but remains permanently bound to the
DhaL subunit  where it is rephosphorylated in situ by the third subunit, DhaM,
which is  homologous  to  the  IIA  domain  of  the mannose transporter of the
bacterial PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (see <PDOC00528>) [1,2].

The DhaK  domain  consists  of  two  alpha/beta-folds,  each containing a six-
stranded  mixed beta-sheet  surrounded  by six and three helices, respectively
(see <PDB:1UN8>). Dha is bound in hemiaminal linkage to the imidazole nitrogen
of an invariant histidine [3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire DhaK domain.
