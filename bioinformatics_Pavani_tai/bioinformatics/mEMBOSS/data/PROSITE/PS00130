* Uracil-DNA glycosylase signature *
************************************

Uracil-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-)  (UNG) [1] is  a  DNA repair  enzyme  that
excises uracil residues from DNA by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond.  Uracil in
DNA can arise as  a  result  of  misincorportation  of  dUMP residues  by  DNA
polymerase or deamination of cytosine.

The sequence of uracil-DNA  glycosylase  is  extremely  well  conserved [2] in
bacteria and  eukaryotes  as well as in herpes viruses. More distantly related
uracil-DNA glycosylases are also found in poxviruses [3].

In eukaryotic  cells,  UNG activity  is  found  in  both  the  nucleus and the
mitochondria. Human  UNG1  protein is transported to both the mitochondria and
the nucleus [4]. The N-terminal 77 amino acids of UNG1 seem to be required for
mitochondrial localization  [4],  but  the presence of a mitochondrial transit
peptide has not been directly demonstrated.

As  a  signature  for  this type  of  enzyme, we  selected the most N-terminal
conserved region. This region contains an aspartic acid residue which has been
proposed, based  on  X-ray  structures  [5,6]  to act as a general base in the
catalytic mechanism.

-Consensus pattern: [KR]-[LIVA]-[LIVC]-[LIVM]-x-G-[QI]-D-P-Y
                    [D is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In  humans, two  additional  sequences of UNG have been reported [7,8].
 These isozymes  are  not evolutionary related to other known UNG. One of them
 is a  glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  dehydrogenase [8] and the other related to
 cyclins [9]. Data available on three proteins proposed to be human uracil-DNA
 glycosylases is discussed in [10].
