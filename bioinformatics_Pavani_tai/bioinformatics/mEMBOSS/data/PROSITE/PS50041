**********************************************
* C-type lectin domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

A number of different families of  proteins share a conserved domain which was
first characterized in  some  animal lectins  and  which seem to function as a
calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain [1,2,3]. This  domain, which
is known as the C-type lectin domain (CTL)  or as the carbohydrate-recognition
domain (CRD),  consists of about 110 to 130 residues. There are four cysteines
which are perfectly conserved and involved in two disulfide bonds. A schematic
representation of the CTL domain is shown below.

The categories of proteins, in which the CTL domain has been found, are listed
below.

Type-II membrane proteins where the CTL domain  is  located  at the C-terminal
extremity of the proteins:

 - Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR)  (also  known as hepatic lectins) [4].
   The ASGPR's  mediate the endocytosis of plasma glycoproteins  to  which the
   terminal  sialic acid  residue  in  their carbohydrate  moieties  has  been
   removed.
 - Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon  Fc receptor (lymphocyte IgE receptor),
   which plays  an  essential  role in the regulation of IgE production and in
   the differentiation of B cells.
 - Kupffer cell receptor.  A  receptor  with  an  affinity  for  galactose and
   fucose, that could be involved in endocytosis.
 - A number of proteins  expressed on the  surface of  natural killer T-cells:
   NKG2, NKR-P1,  YE1/88  (Ly-49),  CD69 and on B-cells: CD72, LyB-2. The CTL-
   domain in these proteins is  distantly related  to other CTL-domains; it is
   unclear whether they are likely to bind carbohydrates.

Proteins that consist of an N-terminal collagenous domain  followed  by a CTL-
domain [5], these proteins are sometimes called 'collectins':

 - Pulmonary surfactant-associated  protein  A (SP-A).   SP-A  is  a  calcium-
   dependent protein that binds to surfactant phospholipids and contributes to
   lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli of the
   mammalian lung.
 - Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D).
 - Conglutinin, a calcium-dependent lectin-like protein which binds to a yeast
   cell wall extract and to immune complexes through  the complement component
   (iC3b).
 - Mannan-binding proteins (MBP)  (also  known as  mannose-binding  proteins).
   MBP's  bind  mannose  and  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  in  a  calcium-dependent
   manner.
 - Bovine collectin-43 (CL-43).

Selectins (or LEC-CAM) [6,7]. Selectins are cell adhesion molecules implicated
in  the  interaction of  leukocytes  with  platelets  or vascular endothelium.
Structurally, selectins consist of a long extracellular domain, followed by  a
transmembrane  region  and  a  short  cytoplasmic  domain. The   extracellular
domain is itself composed of a CTL-domain,  followed by an EGF-like domain and
a variable number of SCR/Sushi repeats. Known selectins are:

 - Lymph node homing  receptor (also  known as L-selectin, leukocyte  adhesion
   molecule-1, (LAM-1), leu-8, gp90-mel, or LECAM-1)
 - Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1  (ELAM-1, E-selectin or LECAM-2).
   The ligand recognized by ELAM-1 is sialyl-Lewis x.
 - Granule membrane  protein 140 (GMP-140, P-selectin, PADGEM, CD62, or LECAM-
   3). The ligand recognized by GMP-140 is Lewis x.

Large proteoglycans  that contain a  CTL-domain followed by one copy of a SCR/
Sushi repeat, in their C-terminal section:

 - Aggrecan (cartilage-specific proteoglycan core protein).  This proteoglycan
   is a major component of the  extracellular matrix of cartilagenous  tissues
   where it has a role in the resistance to compression.
 - Brevican.
 - Neurocan.
 - Versican  (large  fibroblast  proteoglycan), a  large  chondroitin  sulfate
   proteoglycan that may play a role in  intercellular signalling.

In addition  to  the  CTL  and  Sushi domains, these proteins also contain, in
their N-terminal  domain,  an  Ig-like V-type region, two or four link domains
(see <PDOC00955>) and up to two EGF-like repeats.

Two type-I membrane proteins:

 - Mannose receptor from macrophages. This protein mediates the endocytosis of
   glycoproteins by macrophages in several  recognition  and uptake processes.
   Its extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed
   by eight tandem repeats of the CTL domain.
 - 180    Kd    secretory  phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). A protein whose
   structure is highly similar to that of the mannose receptor.
 - DEC-205  receptor.  This  protein    is  used by dendritic cells and thymic
   epithelial cells  to  capture  and  endocytose diverse carbohydrate-binding
   antigens and direct them to antigen-processing cellular compartiments. DEC-
   205 extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed
   by ten tandem repeats of the CTL domain.
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed  of  2  FA58C  domains (see <PDOC00988>), a CTL
   domain, 2 VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a CTCK (see <PDOC00912>).

Various other proteins that uniquely consist of a CTL domain:

 - Invertebrate soluble galactose-binding lectins.  A category to which belong
   a humoral lectin from a  flesh fly; echinoidin, a lectin from  the coelomic
   fluid of a sea urchin; BRA-2 and BRA-3, two lectins from the coelomic fluid
   of a barnacle, a  lectin from the tunicate Polyandrocarpa misakiensis and a
   newt oviduct lectin. The  physiological  importance of these lectins is not
   yet known but they may play an important role in defense mechanisms.
 - Pancreatic stone protein (PSP)  (also known  as  pancreatic  thread protein
   (PTP), or reg), a protein that might act  as  an  inhibitor  of spontaneous
   calcium carbonate precipitation.
 - Pancreatitis associated protein (PAP), a  protein that might be involved in
   the control of bacterial proliferation.
 - Tetranectin, a plasma protein that binds  to  plasminogen  and  to isolated
   kringle 4.
 - Eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), a cytotoxic protein.
 - A galactose specific lectin from a rattlesnake.
 - Two subunits of a coagulation factor IX/factor X-binding protein (IX/X-bp),
   a snake venom anticoagulant protein  which  binds with  factors IX and X in
   the presence of calcium.
 - Two subunits of  a  phospholipase A2 inhibitor from  the  plasma of a snake
   (PLI-A and PLI-B).
 - A lipopolysaccharide-binding  protein  (LPS-BP)  from  the  hemolymph  of a
   cockroach [8].
 - Sea raven antifreeze protein (AFP) [9].

As a signature pattern for this domain, we selected the C-terminal region with
its three conserved cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: C-[LIVMFYATG]-x(5,12)-[WL]-{T}-[DNSR]-{C}-{LI}-C-x(5,6)-
                    [FYWLIVSTA]-[LIVMSTA]-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 the distantly related natural killer T-cell and B-cell proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 15.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note: All CTL domains have five Trp residues before the second Cys,  with the
 exception of tunicate lectin and cockroach LPS-BP which have Leu.
