*****************************************************

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases  (PARP)  (EC 2.4.2.30)  are a  family  of enzymes
present in eukaryotes which catalyzes  the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of a limited
number of  proteins  involved in chromatin architecture, DNA repair, or in DNA
metabolism including   PARP  itself.  PARP,  also  known  as  poly(ADP-ribose)
synthase and  poly(ADP-ribose)  transferase,  transfers  the ADP-ribose moiety
from its  substrate,  nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide (NAD), to carboxylate
groups of aspartic and glutamic residues. Whereas some PARPs might function in
genome protection,  others  appear  to  play  different  roles  in  the  cell,
including telomere   replication   and   cellular   transport.   PARP-1  is  a
multifunctional enzyme.   The  polypeptide  has  a  highly  conserved  modular
organization consisting   of  an  N-terminal  DNA-binding  domain,  a  central
regulating segment,  and  a C-terminal or F region accommodating the catalytic
center. The  F  region  is  composed  of  two parts: a purely alpha-helical N-
terminal domain  (alpha-hd),  and  the  mixed  alpha/beta C-terminal catalytic
domain bearing  the  putative NAD binding site.  Although proteins of the PARP
family are  related  through their PARP catalytic domain, they do not resemble
each other  outside  of  that  region, but rather, they contain unique domains
that distinguish  them  from  each other and hint at their discrete functions.
Domains to  which  the  PARP catalytic domain is found associated with include
zinc fingers   (see   <PDOC00360>),   SAP   (see  <PDOC50800>),  ankyrin  (see
<PDOC50088>), BRCT (see <PDOC50172>), Macro domain, SAM (see <PDOC50105>), WWE
(see <PDOC50918>) and UIM (see <PDOC50330>) [1,2,3].

The alpha-hd  domain  is  ~130 amino acids in length and consists of an up-up-
down-up-down-down motif  of  helices  (see  <PDB:1PAX>  and <PDB:1GS0>). It is
thought to relay the activation signal issued on binding to damaged DNA [4,5].
The PARP  catalytic  domain  is  ~230  residues  in length (see <PDB:1PAX> and
<PDB:1GS0>). Its  core consists of a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and
four-stranded mixed  beta-sheet.  The  two  sheets  are  consecutive  and  are
connected via  a single pair of hydrogen bonds between two strands that run at
an angle of 90 degree. These central beta-sheets are surrounded by five alpha-
helices, three 3(10)-helices, and by a three- and a two-stranded beta-sheet in
a 37-residue  excursion  between  two  central  beta-strands [4,5]. The active
site, known  as  the  'PARP signature' is formed by a block of 50 amino acids,
the 'PARP  signature',  that  are strictly conserved among the vertebrates and
highly conserved  among all species. The 'PARP signature' is characteristic of
all PARP  protein family members. It is formed by a segment of conserved amino
acid residues  formed  by a beta-sheet, an alpha-helix, a 3(10)-helix, a beta-
sheet, and an alpha-helix [3].

Some proteins known to belong to the PARP family are listed below [2,3]:

 - PARP-1. It is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage.
 - PARP-2.
 - PARP-3.  It  is  a  core  component of the centrosome and is preferentially
   associated with the daughter centriole at all stages of the cell cycle.
 - PARP-4  or  VPARP.  It  is  associated  with vault particles, a cytoplasmic
   ribonucleoprotein complex   that  associates  two  other  highly  conserved
   proteins, major  vault  protein  (MVP)  and  telomerase-associated  protein
   (TEP1) and an untranslated vault RNA (VRNA).
 - PARP-5a   or  Tankyrase  1  (TRF1-interacting,  ankyrin-related  ADP-ribose
   polymerase). The  alpha-hd  domain  is  replaced  in  Tankyrase  by the SAM
   domain.
 - PARP-5b  or  Tankyrase  2.  It  appears  to  interact with many partners at
   discrete subcellular  locations,  including the Glgi complex and endosomes.
 - PARP-7 or TiPARP. It has been identified as a 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
   dioxin (TCDD)-induced mRNA.
 - PARP-9 or Bal.
 - PARP-10.
 - PARP-11.
 - PARP-14.
 - PARP-15.
