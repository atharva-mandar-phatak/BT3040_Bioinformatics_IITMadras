* Stress-response A/B barrel domain profile *
*********************************************

The stress-response  A/B  barrel domain is found in a class of stress-response
proteins in  plants  and in some bacterial fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. The
stress-response A/B  barrel  domain  forms  a  very  stable  dimer. This dimer
belongs to  the  superfamily  of  dimeric  alpha+beta barrels in which the two
beta-sheets form  a beta-barrel. The two molecules in the dimer are related by
a 2-fold  axis  parallel  to  helix  H1  and beta-strands B3 and B4. The outer
surface of  the  beta-sheets  of  the  two  molecules forms a beta-barrel-like
structure defining  a  central  pore.  The function of the stress-response A/B
barrel domain is unknown [1,2,3].

The stress-response  A/B  barrel domain has an alpha/beta structure consisting
of a  four-stranded  antiparallel beta-sheet and three alpha-helices, arranged
in a  Beta-Alpha-Beta-Beta-Alpha-Alpha-Beta  topology  (see  <PDB:1Q4R>).  Two
sheets join  at  their  edges  to  form an oblong beta-barrel, flanked by four
helices on  each of the opposing faces. C-terminal residues extending from the
beta4 strand of each monomer wrap around and connect with the beta2 strand and
alpha1 helix of the opposing monomer to form the dimer interface [1,2,3].

Some proteins  known to contain a stress response A/B barrel domain are listed
below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana At3g17210
 - Arabidopsis thaliana At5g22580
 - Populus  tremula  stable  protein  1  (SP-1)  (also  known as Pop3 in other
   Populus species), a thermostable stress-responsive protein.
 - Pseudomonas hydrogenothermophila fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (cbbA).

The profile we developed covers the entire stress-response A/B barrel domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
