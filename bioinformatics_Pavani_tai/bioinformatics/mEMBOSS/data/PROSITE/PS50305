* Sirtuin catalytic domain profile *
************************************

The sirtuin  family  is  broadly conserved from bacteria to human. Yeast SIR2,
the founding  member,  was  first isolated as part of the SIR complex required
for maintaining    a modified chromatin structure at telomeres. SIR2 functions
in transcriptional silencing, cell cycle progression, and chromosome stability
[1]. Although  most  sirtuins  in eukaryotic cells are located in the nucleus,
others are cytoplasmic or mitochondrial.

Sirtuins are  responsible  for  a  newly  classified  chemical  reaction, NAD-
dependent protein  deacetylation.  The  final products of the reaction are the
deacetylated peptide  and  an  acetyl  ADP-ribose  [2].  In  nuclear  sirtuins
this  deacetylation  reaction  is  mainly directed against histones acetylated
lysines [3].

Sirtuins typically  consist  of  two  optional  and  highly variable N- and C-
terminal domain  (50-300  aa) and a conserved catalytic core domain (~250 aa).
Mutagenesis  experiments suggest  that  the  N-  and  C-terminal  regions help
direct catalytic core domain to different targets [3,4].

The 3D-structure  of an archaeal sirtuin in complex with NAD (see <PDB:1ICI >)
reveals that the protein consists of a large domain having a Rossmann fold and
a  small domain containing a three-stranded zinc ribbon motif. NAD is bound in
a pocket between the two domains [5].

Proteins currently known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Yeast SIR2.
 - Yeast HST1 to HST4.
 - Mammalian Sirtuins 1 to 5.
 - Drosophila Sir2 protein.
 - Bacterial cobB.

The profile we developed covers the complete catalytic core domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
