* FG-GAP repeat profile *
*************************

Integrins  are  cell  adhesion  receptors  that transmit bidirectional signals
across the plasma membrane and link the extracellular environment to the actin
cytoskeleton  [1].  Integrins  are  formed  from  alpha and beta subunits. The
N-terminal  region  of  alpha  subunits contains seven 60 amino acids sequence
repeats which fold into a beta-propeller domain [2]. Integrins bind ligands at
the interface between the alpha subunit beta-propeller domain and beta subunit
I  domain  [3].  These  domains  associate  over a large interface to form the
integrin  head.  The  seven  FG-GAP  repeat domain is also found in the enzyme
phosphatidylinositol phospholipase D.

The  crystal structure of the beta-propeller FG-GAP domain of integrin alpha V
shows that the domain consists of seven radially arranged "blades" each formed
from a four-stranded antiparallel sheet (ABCD) (see <PDB:1JV2>) [4]. The inner
strand  (strand  A)  of  each  blade  lines  the  channel at the center of the
propeller,  and  strand  D  of  the  next repeat forming the outer edge of the
blade.  The  beta-propeller  is circularized by juxtaposition of the C7 and D1
strands. Several Ca2+-binding sites are found in hairpin loops connecting beta
strands.

The profile we developed covers strand B,C,D and A of the FG-GAP repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
