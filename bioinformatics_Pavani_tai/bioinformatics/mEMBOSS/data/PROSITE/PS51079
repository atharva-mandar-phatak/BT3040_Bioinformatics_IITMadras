* MBT repeat profile *
**********************

The  Polycomb-group  protein Sex Comb on midleg (SCM) and the tumor suppressor
protein  lethal  (3) malignant brain tumor (l(3)mbt) , share a homology region
consisting  of  two repeats, each about 100 amino acids in length. This repeat
has been name MBT after its occurence in l(3)mbt [1].

The  structure  of  MBT  repeats  has been solved (see <PDB:1OI1>) [2,3]. Each
repeat consists of an extended "arm" and a globular core. The arm of the first
repeat  packs  against  the core of the second repeat and vice versa. The core
consists  of  an  SH3-like  five stranded beta-barrel followed by a C-terminal
alpha-helice   and   another   short  beta-strand.  The  MBT  structure  shows
significant  similarities  with  the  Tudor  (see  <PDOC50304>), the PWWP (see
<PDOC50812>)  and  the chromo (see <PDOC00517>) domains within the beta-barrel
portion  of  the structure. Given their similarity to these domains, a binding
role   is  probable,  and  post-translationally  modified  histones  are  good
candidates for binding targets [3,4].

The profile we developed covers the whole MBT repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
