* SEA domain profile *
**********************

The  SEA  domain has been named after the first three proteins in which it was
identified (Sperm  protein, Enterokinase and Agrin). The SEA domain has around
120 residues, it is an extracellular domain whose function is not known. It is
found  in  one or two copies in mosaic extracellular or transmembrane proteins
[E1].  The  SEA  domain is closely associated with regions receiving extensive
O-glycosylation.  It  has  been  proposed  that  carbohydrates are required to
stabilize  SEA  domains  and  protect them against proteolytic degradation and
that the extent of substitution may control proteolytic processing [1,2].

The  SEA  domain  contains  an  about 80-residue conserved region and an about
40-residue  segment  that  separates  the conserved region from the subsequent
C-terminal  domains.  Secondary  structure  predictions and circular dichroism
suggest  an  alternating conformation of beta sheets and alpha helices for the
SEA domain [1,3].

Some proteins known to contain a SEA domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  agrin,  an  heparan sulfate proteoglycan of the basal lamina of
   the neuromuscular  junction.  It  is  responsible  for  the  clustering  of
   acetylcholine receptors  (AChRs)  and  other  proteins at the neuromuscular
   junction.
 - Mammalian  enterokinase.  It  catalyzes  the  conversion  of trypsinogen to
   trypsin which    in    turn    activates    other    proenzymes   including
   chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, and proelastases.
 - 63  kDa  sea  urchin  sperm  protein  (SP63). It might mediate sperm-egg or
   sperm-matrix interactions.
 - Animal  perlecan,  a  heparan  sulfate containing proteoglycan found in all
   basement membranes.  It  interacts  with other basement membrane components
   such as  laminin and collagen type IV and serves as an attachment substrate
   for cells.
 - Some  vertebrate epithelial mucins. They form a family of secreted and cell
   surface glycoproteins  expressed  by  epithelial  tissues and implicated in
   epithelial cell protection, adhesion modulation and signaling.
 - Mammalian  cell  surface antigen 114/A10, an integral transmembrane protein
   that is  highly  expressed  in  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells  and IL-3-
   dependent cell lines.

The profile we have developed covers the entire SEA domain, e.g. the conserved
region and the less conserved extension following it.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
