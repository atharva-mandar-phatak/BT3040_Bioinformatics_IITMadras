* Big-1 (bacterial Ig-like domain 1) domain profile *
*****************************************************

The bacterial immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain 1 or Big-1 domain is a domain of
~95 amino acids present in bacterial adhesion molecules of the intimin/invasin
family,  involved in pathogenicity. The domain is named after the 3D structure
of  the  domain  in  enteropathogenic Escherichia coli intimin and in Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis  invasin,  which  are both adhesins with a tandem repeat of
the  Big-1  domain.  The  3D  structure  of  the  Big-1 domain is a beta-sheet
sandwich (see <PDB:1CWV>) with a topology similar to eukaryotic members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily (see <PDOC50835>). In most intimin/invasin proteins
the Big-1 domain occurs in a tandem, N-terminal to a different Ig-like domain,
followed  by  a  C-terminal C-type lectin-like domain. Big-1 can also occur in
combination  with  the  lysM  domain  or in a tandem repeat of several copies.
Big-1 proteins are surface-expressed proteins that mediate mammalian host cell
invasion or attachment. The tandem of Ig-like domains appears to form a rod to
link  the bacterial outer membrane anchor to the C-terminal lectin-like domain
to interact with their receptors in the host cell membrane [1-3].

Some proteins known to contain a Big-1 (Bacterial Ig-like domain 1) domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  O127:H6/EPEC  and  O157:H7/EHEC intimin or attaching and
   effacing  protein, present on the surface of diarrheagenic enteric bacteria
   and  involved in adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells in the gut. Intimin
   binds to the bacterial Tir protein, which is secreted and inserted into the
   host membrane.
 - Yersinia   pseudotuberculosis  and  Y.  enterocolitica  invasin,  an  outer
   membrane  protein  that  mediates entry into eukaryotic cells by binding to
   beta-1 integrins.
 - Escherichia  coli yeeJ, a hypothetical protein.

The  profile we developed covers the entire Big-1 (Bacterial Ig-like domain 1)
domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
