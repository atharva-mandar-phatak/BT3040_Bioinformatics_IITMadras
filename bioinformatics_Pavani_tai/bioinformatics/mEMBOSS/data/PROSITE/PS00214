* Cytosolic fatty-acid binding proteins signature *
***************************************************

A number of  low molecular  weight proteins which  bind fatty  acids and other
organic anions are present in the cytosol [1,2]. Most of them are structurally
related and have probably diverged from a common ancestor. This structure is a
ten stranded  antiparallel  beta-barrel,  albeit  with  a  wide  discontinuity
between the fourth and fifth strands, with a repeated + 1 topology enclosing a
internal ligand  binding  site  [2,7]. Proteins known to belong to this family
include:

 - Six,  tissue-specific,  types  of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) found
   in liver,  intestine, heart, epidermal, adipocyte, brain/retina. Heart FABP
   is also  known  as  mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI), a protein that
   reversibly inhibits  proliferation  of  mammary  carcinoma cells. Epidermal
   FABP is also known as psoriasis-associated FABP [3].
 - Insect muscle fatty acid-binding proteins.
 - Testis lipid binding protein (TLBP).
 - Cellular retinol-binding proteins I and II (CRBP).
 - Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP).
 - Gastrotropin, an ileal protein which stimulates gastric acid and pepsinogen
   secretion. It seems that gastrotropin binds to bile salts and bilirubins.
 - Fatty  acid  binding  proteins  MFB1 and MFB2 from the midgut of the insect
   Manduca sexta [4].

In addition to the above cytosolic proteins, this family also includes:

 - Myelin P2 protein, which may be a lipid transport protein in Schwann cells.
   P2 is associated with the lipid bilayer of myelin.
 - Schistosoma mansoni protein Sm14 [5] which seems  to  be  involved  in  the
   transport of fatty acids.
 - Ascaris  suum  p18  a secreted protein that may play a role in sequestering
   potentially toxic  fatty  acids and their peroxidation products or that may
   be involved  in  the  maintenance  of  the  impermeable  lipid layer of the
   eggshell.
 - Hypothetical  fatty  acid-binding  proteins  F40F4.2,  F40F4.3, F40F4.4 and
   ZK742.5 from Caenorhabditis elegans.

We use as a signature pattern for these proteins a segment from the N-terminal
extremity.

-Consensus pattern: [GSAIVK]-{FE}-[FYW]-x-[LIVMF]-x(2)-{K}-x-[NHG]-[FY]-[DE]-
                    x-[LIVMFY]-[LIVM]-{N}-{G}-[LIVMAKR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 22.

-Note: It  is  suggested, on the basis of similarities of structure, function,
 and sequence,    that  this  family  forms an overall superfamily, called the
 calycins, with  the lipocalin <PDOC00187> and avidin/streptavidin <PDOC00499>
 families [6,7].
