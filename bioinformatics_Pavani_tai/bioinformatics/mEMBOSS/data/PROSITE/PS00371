****************************************************************

The  phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) [1,2]
is  a  major  carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyzes the
phosphorylation   of   incoming   sugar   substrates  concomitant  with  their
translocation  across  the  cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS is
the   following:   a   phosphoryl  group  from  phosphoenolpyruvate  (PEP)  is
transferred to enzyme I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl
carrier  protein  (HPr)  (see  <PDOC00318>).  Phospho-HPr  then  transfers the
phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three
structurally  distinct  domains  (IIA,  IIB, and IIC), [3] which can either be
fused  together  in  a  single  polypeptide  chain  or  exist  as two or three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The  first  domain (IIA) , carries the first permease-specific phosphorylation
site,  an  histidine which is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The second domain
(IIB)  (see  <PDOC00795>)  is  phosphorylated by phospho-IIA on a cysteinyl or
histidyl  residue, depending on the sugar transported. Finally, the phosphoryl
group  is transferred from the IIB domain to the sugar substrate concomitantly
with  the  sugar uptake processed by the IIC domain (see <PDOC51103>). The IIC
domain  forms  the translocation channel and at the specific substrate-binding
site.  An additional transmembrane domain IID (see <PDOC51108>), homologous to
IIC, can be found in some PTSs, e.g. for mannose [1,3,4,5,6].

According   to   structural   and   sequence  analyses,  the  PTS EIIA  domain
(EC 2.7.1.-) can be divided in five groups [7,8,9,10].

 - The PTS EIIA type 1 domain, which is found in the Glucose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids. It forms an antiparallel
   beta-barrel   structure  that  incorporates  'Greek  key'  and  'jellyroll'
   topological  motifs  (see  <PDB:1GPR>).  The  phosphorylation site (His) is
   located  in  the  middle  of the domain, at the C-terminus of a beta-strand
   [7].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 2  domain, which is  found in the Mannitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length  of  about  142  amino  acids.  It  consists of an
   alternating  beta/alpha  arrangement  of  five-stranded beta-sheet and five
   alpha-helices,  where  the  two last alpha helices forms an helical hairpin
   (see  <PDB:1PDO>).  The  phosphorylation  site  (His)  is  located  at  the
   N-terminus of the domain, at the topological switch-point of the structure,
   close to the subunit interface [8].

 - The PTS EIIA type 3 domain, which is found in the Lactose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  100  amino  acids.  It is composed of three
   alpha-helices  (see  <PDB:1E2A>). The phosphorylation site (His) is located
   at the C-terminus of the domain in the third alpha helix [9].

 - The PTS EIIA type 4 domain, which is found in the Mannose class of PTS, has
   an  average  length  of  about  130  amino  acids.  It consists of a single
   five-stranded  mixed  beta  sheet,  flanked  by  helices on both sides (see
   <PDB:1A3A>).  The  phosphorylation  site (His) is located at the end of the
   third  beta  strand,  in  a shallow crevice lined with hydrophobic residues
   [10].

 - The  PTS EIIA type 5  domain, which is found  in the Sorbitol class of PTS,
   has  an  average  length of about 110 amino acids. The phosphorylation site
   (His) is located at the N-terminus of the domain.

EIIA-like  domains  similar  to  type  1  to  4  can be found in other kind of
proteins, which are mainly transcriptional regulators [5]. In these cases, the
EIIA-like  domain is found in association with other domains like the Sigma-54
interaction    domain    (see   <PDOC00579>),   the   DeoR-type   HTH   domain
(see   <PDOC00696>),   or   the   PTS   regulation   domain   (transcriptional
antiterminator).   It   may   possess   a  regulatory  function,  through  its
phosphorylation  activity,  or act as a simple phosphoryl donor. Some proteins
known to contains a EIIA-like domain are listed below:

 - Bacterial transcriptional regulatory proteins levR, nrtC, bglG.
 - Bacterial lactose permease lacS, a non-PTS transport system.
 - Bacterial PTS-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase, phosphotransferase subunit
   dhaM.

We  have  developed two signature patterns for the phosphorylation site of the
IIA  domains.  We  also developed five profiles that cover the entire PTS EIIA
domains. These profiles are directed respectively against the Glucose class of
PTS, the Mannitol class of PTS, the Lactose class of PTS, the Mannose class of
PTS, and the Sorbitol class of PTS.
