* Syndecans signature *
***********************

Syndecans [1,2]  (from  the  greek  syndein; to bind together) are a family of
transmembrane heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans  which  are  implicated  in  the
binding of extracellular matrix components and growth factors. Syndecans bind
a variety  of  molecules  via  their  heparan  sulfate  chains  and can act as
receptors or as co-receptors.

Structurally, these proteins consist of four separate domains:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) An extracellular domain (ectodomain) of variable length and whose sequence
    is not  evolutionary  conserved  in  the  various  forms of syndecans. The
    ectodomain contains  the  sites  of  attachment  of  the  heparan  sulfate
    glycosaminoglycan side chains;
 c) A transmembrane region;
 d) A  highly  conserved  cytoplasmic  domain of about 30 to 35 residues which
    could interact with cytoskeletal proteins.

The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Syndecan 1.
 - Syndecan 2 or fibroglycan.
 - Syndecan 3 or neuroglycan or N-syndecan.
 - Syndecan 4 or amphiglycan or ryudocan.
 - Drosophila syndecan.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans probable syndecan (F57C7.3).

The signature  pattern  that  we  developed for syndecans starts with the last
residue of  the transmembrane region and includes the first 10 residues of the
cytoplasmic domain. This region, which contains four basic residues, could act
as a stop transfer site.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-R-[IM]-[KR]-K(2)-D-E-G-S-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
