* Purine and other phosphorylases family 1 signature *
******************************************************

The following phosphorylases belongs to the same family:

 - Purine   nucleoside  phosphorylase  (EC  2.4.2.1)  (PNP) from most bacteria
   (gene deoD). This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of guanosine or  inosine to
   respective bases and sugar-1-phosphate molecules [1].
 - Uridine  phosphorylase  (EC 2.4.2.3) (UdRPase) from bacteria (gene udp) and
   mammals. Catalyzes  the  cleavage of  uridine  into  uracil  and  ribose-1-
   phosphate. The  products  of  the  reaction  are  used either as carbon and
   energy sources  or  in  the  rescue  of  pyrimidine  bases  for  nucleotide
   synthesis [2].
 - 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.28) (MTA phosphorylase) from
   Sulfolobus solfataricus [3].

As a signature  pattern, we selected a conserved region in the central part of
these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [GST]-x-G-[LIVM]-G-x-[PA]-S-x-[GSTAL]-[IL]-x(3)-E-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: It  should  be  noted  that mammalian and some bacterial PNP as well as
 eukaryotic MTA  phosphorylase  belong to a different family of phosphorylases
 (see <PDOC00954>).

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
