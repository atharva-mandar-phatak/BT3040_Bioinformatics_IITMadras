* Kinesin motor domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

Kinesin [1,2,3] is a  microtubule-associated  force-producing protein that may
play a role in organelle transport.  Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed
of two  heavy  chains  and  two  light  chains.  The kinesin motor activity is
directed toward the microtubule's plus end.

The heavy  chain is  composed of three structural domains: a large globular N-
terminal domain  which is responsible for the motor activity of kinesin (it is
known to  hydrolyze  ATP,  to bind and move on microtubules), a central alpha-
helical coiled  coil  domain that mediates the heavy chain dimerization; and a
small globular  C-terminal domain which interacts with other proteins (such as
the kinesin light chains), vesicles and membranous organelles.

A number of proteins have been  recently  found that contain a  domain similar
to that of the kinesin 'motor' domain [1,4,E1]:

 - Drosophila claret segregational protein (ncd).   Ncd is required for normal
   chromosomal  segregation  in  meiosis, in females,  and  in  early  mitotic
   divisions of the embryo.  The  ncd  motor  activity  is directed toward the
   microtubule's minus end.
 - Drosophila kinesin-like protein (nod). Nod is required for the distributive
   chromosome segregation of nonexchange chromosomes during meiosis.
 - Human CENP-E [4]. CENP-E is a protein  that  associates  with  kinetochores
   during   chromosome  congression,  relocates  to  the   spindle  midzone at
   anaphase, and is quantitatively discarded at the end of the cell division.
   CENP-E is probably an important  motor molecule in chromosome movement and/
   or spindle elongation.
 - Human  mitotic  kinesin-like  protein-1  (MKLP-1),  a  motor  protein whose
   activity is directed toward the microtubule's plus end.
 - Yeast KAR3 protein,  which  is  essential  for  yeast nuclear fusion during
   mating. KAR3 may  mediate  microtubule  sliding  during  nuclear fusion and
   possibly mitosis.
 - Yeast  CIN8  and  KIP1  proteins which are required for the assembly of the
   mitotic spindle.  Both proteins  seem to interact with spindle microtubules
   to produce an outwardly directed force acting upon the poles.
 - Fission yeast cut7 protein, which is essential for spindle body duplication
   during mitotic division.
 - Emericella  nidulans  bimC,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  nuclear
   division.
 - Emericella nidulans klpA.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans unc-104, which may  be required for the transport of
   substances needed for neuronal cell differentiation.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans osm-3.
 - Xenopus Eg5, which may be involved in mitosis.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana KatA, KatB and katC.
 - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii FLA10/KHP1 and KLP1. Both proteins seem to play a
   role in the rotation or twisting of the microtubules of the flagella.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09A5.2.

The kinesin motor  domain  is  located  in  the N-terminal part of most of the
above proteins,  with the exception of KAR3, klpA, and ncd where it is located
in the C-terminal section.

The kinesin motor domain contains about  330 amino acids. An ATP-binding motif
of type A is found  near position 80 to 90,  the C-terminal half of the domain
is involved in microtubule-binding.  The  signature pattern for that domain is
derived from a conserved decapeptide inside the microtubule-binding part.
