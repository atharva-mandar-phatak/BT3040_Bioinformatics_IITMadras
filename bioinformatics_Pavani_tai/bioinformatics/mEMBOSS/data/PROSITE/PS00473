* Gonadotropin-releasing hormones signature *
*********************************************

The gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) (gonadoliberin) [1,E1] are a family
of peptides  that  play  a  pivotal role in reproduction. The main function of
GnRH is  to  act  on the pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of
luteinizing  and  follicle-stimulating  hormones, but  GnRH  also  acts on the
brain, retina,  sympathetic  nervous  system, gonads  and  placenta in certain
species. There  seems  to  be at least three forms of GnRH. The second form is
expressed in midbrain and seems to be widespread. The third form has only been
found so far in fish.

GnRH is  a C-terminal  amidated  decapeptide processed from a larger precursor
protein. Four  of  the  ten  residues  are perfectly  conserved in all species
where GnRH has been sequenced.
