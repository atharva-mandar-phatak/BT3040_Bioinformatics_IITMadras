* Arfaptin homology (AH) domain profile *
*****************************************

The arfaptin  homology domain (AH) is an about 210-residue region of homology,
which has  been  identified between PICK1 and arfaptins [1]. The AH domain can
be found  alone  or  in  association  with  other  domains  such  as  PDZ (see
<PDOC50106>) [1].  The AH domain of arfaptin has been shown to dimerize and to
bind Arf and Rho family GTPases [2,3].

The resolution  of  arfaptin  has  shown  that the AH domain consists of three
alpha-helices arranged  as  an extended antiparallel alpha-helical bundle. Two
arfaptin AH  domains  associate  to  form  a highly elongated, crescent-shaped
dimer (see <PDB:1I49>) [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain an AH domain are listed below:

 - Animal protein kinase C-binding protein PICK1.
 - Animal arfaptin 1 and 2. Arfaptins are effectors of two G proteins, Rac and
   Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor).
 - Mammalian 69 kDa islet cell autoantigen (ICA69) [4]. It is likely to play a
   role in  membrane  trafficking  at the Golgi complex and immature secretory
   granules in neurosecretory cells.

The profile we developed covers the entire AH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
