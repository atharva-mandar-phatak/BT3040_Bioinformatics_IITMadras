* Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase family signature *
********************************************************

Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.31) (UPP synthase) [1] generates
undecaprenyl pyrophosphate  (UPP)  from  isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). This
bacterial enzyme  is  also  found in archaebacteria; it is also related to the
following uncharacterized proteins:

 - Yeast chromosome II hypothetical protein YBR002c.
 - Yeast chromosome XIII hypothetical protein YMR101c.
 - Schizosaccharomyces pombe hypothetical protein SpAC4D7.04c.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv1086.
 - A Corynebacterium glutamicum hypothetical protein in aroF 3'region.
 - A Streptomyces fradiae hypothetical protein in transposon Tn4556.

These are  proteins  of  about  26  to  40  Kd  whose  central  region is well
conserved. They can be picked up in the database by the following pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [DEH]-[LIVMF]-[LIVMFC]-[LIVMF]-R-[STPV]-[SGAC]-[GEN]-
                    x(1,2)-R-x-S-x-[FY]-[LMFV]-[LIPMVT]-[YWL]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
