* Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) signature *
*****************************************************

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP)  (EC 4.1.1.32)  (PEPCK)  [1] catalyzes
the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate by decarboxylation of  oxaloacetate while
hydrolyzing GTP, a rate limiting step in  gluconeogenesis (the biosynthesis of
glucose).  In vertebrates there  are  two  isozymes: a  cytosolic  form  whose
activity is affected by hormones  regulating  this  metabolic process (such as
glucagon, or insulin) and a mitochondrial form.

An essential  cysteine residue has been  proposed [2] to  be implicated in the
catalytic mechanism; this residue is  located in the central part of PEPCK and
is in the center of  a  perfectly  conserved region that we use as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-P-S-[AGMS]-C-G-K-T-[NS]
                    [C may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  (ATP)  (EC 4.1.1.49)  an enzyme that
 catalyzes the same reaction, but  using ATP instead of GTP, is not related to
 the above enzyme (see <PDOC00460>).

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
