* Huwentoxin-2 family signature *
*********************************

The spider  venoms  often  contain  many  active peptides such as neurotoxins,
lectins, inhibitors  to  enzyme,  etc.  These  peptides are very important for
spider's hunting  and  defending. During the long history of spider evolution,
the peptides  evolved  into  different structures and functions. The following
peptides share high similarity and belong to the huwentoxin-2 family [1-4]:

 - Ornithoctonus   huwena   (Chinese   bird   spider)   (Selenocosmia  huwena)
   huwentoxin-II (HWTX-II)  and  huwentoxin-IIa  (HWTX-IIa),  which  can cause
   reversatile paralysis in insects and are insecticidal toxins.
 - Ornithoctonus   huwena   (Chinese   bird   spider)   (Selenocosmia  huwena)
   huwentoxin-VII (HWTX-VII)  and  huwentoxin-VIII  (HWTX-VIII),  which  block
   neuromuscular transmission.
 - Ornithoctonus   huwena   (Chinese   bird   spider)   (Selenocosmia  huwena)
   huwentoxin-VI (HWTX-VI).
 - Brachypelma smithii (Mexican red knee tarantula) venom protein 1.
 - Lasiodora  parahybana (Salmon pink birdeater) lasiotoxin 1 and 2, which are
   toxic to mice, but not insects.
 - Eurypelma californica (American tarantula) ESTX1 and ESTX2 neurotoxins.

Peptides of  the  huwentoxin-2  family contain 6 cysteine residues involved in
three disulfide  bonds.  The  three  disulfid  bridges  of  HWTX-II  have been
assigned as  C1-C3, C2-C5 and C4-C6 [3]. The structure of HWTX-II contains two
beta-turns and  a  double stranded antiparallel beta-sheet cross-linked by two
disulfide bonds  (2-5 and 4-6) (see <PDB:1I25>). Due to its unique 1-3,2-5,4-6
disulfide bond-pairing, HTWX-II does not form a cystine-knot like other spider
toxins [4].

We developed  a  pattern  for huwentoxin-2 family proteins, which contains the
six conserved cysteines.

-Conserved pattern: C-x(1,4)-[FLIV]-[SEP]-C-[DE]-[EIQ]-x(4,7)-C-x(0,7)-C-
                    [KST]-x(4,18)-C-[YK]-x(1,3)-C
                    [The 6 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
