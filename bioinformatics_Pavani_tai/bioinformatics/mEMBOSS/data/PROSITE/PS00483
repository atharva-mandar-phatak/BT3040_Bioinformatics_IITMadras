*****************************

Dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3) (DHOase)  catalyzes  the third step in the de novo
biosynthesis  of  pyrimidine,  the   conversion  of  ureidosuccinic  acid  (N-
carbamoyl-L-aspartate) into dihydroorotate.  Dihydroorotase  binds  a zinc ion
which is required for its catalytic activity [1].

In bacteria, DHOase is  a dimer  of  identical  chains of about 400 amino-acid
residues (gene pyrC).  In higher  eukaryotes, DHOase is part of a large multi-
functional protein known as 'rudimentary' in Drosophila and CAD in mammals and
which catalyzes  the  first  three  steps  of pyrimidine biosynthesis [2]. The
DHOase domain  is  located in the central part of this polyprotein. In yeasts,
DHOase is    encoded  by    a   monofunctional protein (gene URA4). However, a
defective DHOase domain [3] is found in a multifunctional protein  (gene URA2)
that catalyzes the first two steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis.

The comparison  of  DHOase sequences from various sources shows [4] that there
are two  highly  conserved  regions.  The  first  located  in  the  N-terminal
extremity contains  two  histidine  residues  suggested  [3] to be involved in
binding the zinc ion. The second is found in the C-terminal part. We developed
signature patterns for both regions.

Allantoinase (EC  3.5.2.5)  is  the  enzyme  that  hydrolyzes  allantoin  into
allantoate.  In yeast (gene DAL1) [5], it is the first enzyme in the allantoin
degradation pathway;  in amphibians [6] and fishs it catalyzes the second step
in the  degradation of uric acid. The sequence of allantoinase is evolutionary
related to that of DHOases.
