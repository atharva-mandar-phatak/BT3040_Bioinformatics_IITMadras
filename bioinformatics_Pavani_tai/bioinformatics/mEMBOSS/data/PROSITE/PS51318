* Twin arginine translocation (Tat) signal profile *
****************************************************

The  twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway serves the role of transporting
folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes [1]. Homologs of the genes
that  encode the transport apparatus occur in archaea, bacteria, chloroplasts,
and  plant mitochondria [2]. In bacteria, the Tat pathway catalyzes the export
of  proteins  from  the  cytoplasm  across  the inner/cytoplasmic membrane. In
chloroplasts,  the  Tat  components  are  found  in the thylakoid membrane and
direct the import of proteins from the stroma. The Tat pathway acts separately
from  the  general  secretory  (Sec)  pathway, which transports proteins in an
unfolded state [3].

It  is  generally  accepted  that  the  primary  role  of the Tat system is to
translocate  fully  folded  proteins  across membranes. An example of proteins
that need to be exported in their 3D conformation are redox proteins that have
acquired  complex  multiatom  cofactors  in  the  bacterial  cytoplasm (or the
chloroplast  stroma  or  mitochondrial  matrix).  They  include  hydrogenases,
formate  dehydrogenases,  nitrate  reductases,  trimethylamine  N-oxide (TMAO)
reductases  and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductases [4,5]. The Tat system can
also export whole heteroligomeric complexes in which some proteins have no Tat
signal.  This  is  the  case  of  the  DMSO reductase or formate dehydrogenase
complexes.  But  there  are also other cases where the physiological rationale
for  targeting  a protein to the Tat signal is less obvious. Indeed, there are
examples  of  homologous  proteins  that are in some cases targeted to the Tat
pathway  and  in  other  cases to the Sec apparatus. Some examples are: copper
nitrite    reductases,    flavin    domains    of    flavocytochrome   c   and
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases [6].

In  halophilic  archaea  such  as  Halobacterium  almost all secreted proteins
appear  to  be  Tat  targeted.  It  has  been proposed to be a response to the
difficulties  these  organisms  would  otherwise  face in successfully folding
proteins extracellularly at high ionic strength [7].

The  Tat  signal  peptide  consists  of  three  motifs: the positively charged
N-terminal  motif,  the  hydrophobic  region  and  the  C-terminal region that
generally  ends  with  a  consensus short motif (A-x-A) specifying cleavage by
signal  peptidase.  Sequence analysis revealed that signal peptides capable of
targeting the Tat protein contain the consensus sequence [ST]-R-R-x-F-L-K. The
nearly  invariant  twin-arginine  gave rise to the pathway's name. In addition
the h-region of Tat signal peptides is typically less hydrophobic than that of
Sec-specific signal peptides [4,5].

The  profile  we  developed  recognizes  the whole prokaryotic and archeal Tat
signal from the methionine to the A-x-A short motif.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 for 5 proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 5.
