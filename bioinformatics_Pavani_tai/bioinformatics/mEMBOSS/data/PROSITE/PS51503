* HIG1 domain profile *
***********************

The hypoxia   induced   gene   1   (HIG1)  or  hypoglycemia/hypoxia  inducible
mitochondrial protein   (HIMP1)   is   up-regulated   by   stresses   of   the
microenvironment such  as  low  oxygen  or  low  glucose conditions. HIG1 is a
mitochondrial inner  membrane  protein, which is ubiquitously expressed. It is
predicted to  be  an  integral  membrane protein consisting of two hydrophobic
helices, 21-23  residues in length that might tend to form a hairpin-like loop
across the  bilayer.  HIG1  could  be  implied  in apoptotic or cytoprotective
signals. HIG1  is  a  member of a well conserved eukaryote protein family. The
predicted transmembrane  helice  (TMH)  and  loop  regions  represent the most
highly conserved regions in these proteins [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the predicted TMH and loop regions.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
