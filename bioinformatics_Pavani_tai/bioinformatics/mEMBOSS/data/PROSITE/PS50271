* Zinc finger UBP-type profile *
********************************

The  UBP-type zinc finger was first isolated in some members of a subfamily of
deubiquitinating enzyme, the ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP) (see
<PDOC00750>).  HDAC6  UBP-type  zinc  finger  has  been shown to interact with
ubiquitin   [1,2].   Like  with  other  ubiquitin  binding  domain  (UBD)  the
interaction  with ubiquitin is moderate or even weak. In addition, several UBD
families  have  members  that  do  not  interact  with ubiquitin at all, which
emphasis that  binding  domains  that  are  identified  by similarity searches
should be experimentally verified [3].

Some proteins containing an UBP-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - BRCA1-associated  protein  2  (BRAP2).  It  binds  the nuclear localization
   signal of BRCA1.
 - Animal histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). An atypical deacetylase that contains
   two  functional  catalytic  domains.  HDAC6 shuttles in and out of the cell
   nucleus.  In the cytoplasm it is part of a multiprotein complex involved in
   the control of protein ubiquitination.
 - Various eukaryotic deubiquitinating enzymes of the UBP subfamily.
 - A   small   family   of   uncharacterized   bacterial   proteins  found  in
   Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria.

The profile we developed covers the whole UBP-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The UBP-type zinc finger is also known as the PAZ domain, but this name
 describes another domain in the literature (see <PDOC50821>).
