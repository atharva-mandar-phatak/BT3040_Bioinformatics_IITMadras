* Glycosyl hydrolases family 1 signatures *
*******************************************

It has been shown [1 to 4] that the  following  glycosyl hydrolases can be, on
the basis of sequence similarities, classified into a single family:

 - Beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) from various bacteria such as Agrobacterium
   strain ATCC 21400, Bacillus polymyxa, and Caldocellum saccharolyticum.
 - Two plants (clover) beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21).
 - Two  different  beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23)  from  the archaebacteria
   Sulfolobus solfataricus (genes bgaS and lacS).
 - 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.85) from  various  bacteria such as
   Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
 - 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.86) from Escherichia coli (genes bglB
   and ascB) and from Erwinia chrysanthemi (gene arbB).
 - Plants myrosinases (EC 3.2.1.147) (sinigrinase) (thioglucosidase).
 - Mammalian lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  (LPH)  (EC 3.2.1.108 / EC 3.2.1.62).
   LPH, an integral membrane glycoprotein, is  the  enzyme that splits lactose
   in the small intestine. LPH is a large protein of about 1900 residues which
   contains four tandem repeats  of  a  domain  of about 450 residues which is
   evolutionary related to the above glycosyl hydrolases.

One of the conserved regions in  these enzymes  is  centered  on  a  conserved
glutamic acid residue which has been  shown [5], in the beta-glucosidase  from
Agrobacterium, to  be directly involved  in glycosidic bond cleavage by acting
as a nucleophile. We have used this region as a signature pattern. As a second
signature pattern  we  selected  a  conserved region,  found in the N-terminal
extremity of these enzymes, this region also contains a glutamic acid residue.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFSTC]-[LIVFYS]-[LIV]-[LIVMST]-E-N-G-[LIVMFAR]-[CSAGN]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 14.

-Note: This pattern will pick up the last two domains of LPH;  the  first  two
 domains, which are removed from  the LPH precursor by proteolytic processing,
 have lost the active site glutamate and may therefore be inactive [4].

-Consensus pattern: F-x-[FYWM]-[GSTA]-x-[GSTA]-x-[GSTA](2)-[FYNH]-[NQ]-x-E-x-
                    [GSTA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This pattern will pick up the last three domains of LPH.
