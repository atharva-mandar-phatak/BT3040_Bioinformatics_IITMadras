* REKLES domain profile *
*************************

Members of  the  ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) (see <PDOC51011>) family of
DNA-binding proteins  are  found  in  fungi  and  invertebrate  and vertebrate
metazoans. Bright/ARID3a  and  the  other  two members (Bdp/ARID3b and Bright-
like/ARID3c) have  been described as the "extended" or eARID subfamily, having
additional conserved  sequences  at  both the N and C termini of the core ARID
domain. In  addition to the conserved regions immediately adjacent to the core
ARID, the  eARID proteins also share a conserved motif C-terminal to the ARID,
named the  REKLES domain after a conserved amino acid motif. The REKLES domain
has not   been  found  in  any  non-ARID  proteins.  REKLES  consists  of  two
subdomains: a modestly conserved N-terminal REKLESalpha and a highly conserved
C-terminal REKLESbeta.  REKLES  is a multifunctional domain that as co-evolved
with and  regulates  functional  properties  of  the eARID DNA-binding domain.
REKLESalpha and -beta are required, respectively, for nuclear entry and export
of Bright  during  its nucleoplasmic shuttling. In addition to its function in
nuclear export,  the  REKLESbeta  subdomain regulates the binding of Bright to
nuclear matrix  association  (or  attachment)  regions  (MARs),  its self- and
paralogous (Bdp)  association  and stoichiometry, and its retention within the
nuclear matrix [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire REKLES domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2010 / First entry.
