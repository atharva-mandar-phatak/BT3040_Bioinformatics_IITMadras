* TSC-22 / dip / bun family signature *
***************************************

The following eukaryotic proteins are evolutionary  related and are thought to
be involved in transcriptional regulation.

 - Vertebrate  protein  TSC-22  [1]. This protein of 144 residues seems to act
   a transcriptional regulator on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) promoter.
 - Mammalian  protein  DIP  (DSIP-immunoreactive peptide) [2], a protein of 77
   amino acids, whose function is not yet known.
 - Drosophila  protein  bunched [3] (gene bun) (also known as shortsighted), a
   probable transcription   factor  required  for  peripheral  nervous  system
   morphogenesis, eye development and oogenesis.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T18D3.7.

These proteins  are  highly  similar  in  a  region  of about 50 residues that
include a  conserved  leucine-zipper domain most probably involved in homo- or
hetero-dimerization. As  a  signature  pattern  we selected a highly conserved
stretch of residues that is located just in front of the leucine zipper.

-Consensus pattern: M-D-L-V-K-x-H-L-x(2)-A-V-R-E-E-V-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / First entry.
