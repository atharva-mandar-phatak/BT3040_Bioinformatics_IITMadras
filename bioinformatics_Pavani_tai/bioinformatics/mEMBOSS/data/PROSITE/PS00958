* Transaldolase signatures *
****************************

Transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a three-carbon
ketol unit  from  sedoheptulose  7-phosphate  to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to
form erythrose  4-phosphate  and  fructose  6-phosphate. This enzyme, together
with transketolase,  provides  a  link  between  the  glycolytic  and pentose-
phosphate pathways.  Transaldolase  is an enzyme of about 34 Kd whose sequence
has been well conserved throughout evolution. A lysine has been implicated [1]
in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme; it acts as a nucleophilic group that
attacks the carbonyl group of fructose-6-phosphate.

Transaldolase is  evolutionary  related [2] to a bacterial protein of about 20
Kd (known as talC in Escherichia coli), whose exact function is not yet known.

We developed two signature patterns for these proteins.  The first, located in
the N-terminal  section,  contains  a  perfectly  conserved  pentapeptide; the
second, includes the active site lysine.
