* Kazal serine protease inhibitors family signature and profile *
*****************************************************************

Canonical  serine  proteinase  inhibitors  are  distributed in a wide range of
organisms  from  all  kingdoms  of  life  and  play  crucial  role  in various
physiological    mechanisms    [1].   They   interact   from   the   canonical
proteinase-inhibitor  binding  loop,  where  P1 residue has a predominant role
(the  residue  at  the  P1  position  contributing the carbonyl portion to the
reactive-site  peptide  bond).  These  so-called  canonical inhibitors bind to
their  cognate enzymes in the same manner as a good substrate, but are cleaved
extremely  slowly.  Kazal-type inhibitors represent the most studied canonical
proteinase  inhibitors.  Kazal  inhibitors  are  extremely  variable  at their
reactive  sites.  However,  some  regularity  prevails such as the presence of
lysine at position P1 indicating strong inhibition of trypsin [2].

The  Kazal  inhibitor  has  six  cysteine residues engaged in disulfide bonds
arranged as shown in the following schematic representation:

The  structure  of  classical Kazal domains consists of a central alpha helix,
which  is  inserted  between  two  beta-strands and a third that is toward the
C-terminus  (see  for  example  <PDB:1OVO>)[3].  The  reactive site P1 and the
conformation  of  the  reactive  site  loop  is structurally highly conserved,
similar to the canonical conformation of small serine proteinase inhibitors.

The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), whose physiological function
   is to prevent the trypsin-catalyzed premature activation of zymogens within
   the pancreas.
 - Mammalian seminal acrosin inhibitors.
 - Canidae and felidae submandibular gland double-headed protease  inhibitors,
   which contain  two  Kazal-type  domains, the first one inhibits trypsin and
   the second one elastase.
 - A mouse prostatic  secretory glycoprotein, induced by androgens, and  which
   exhibits anti-trypsin activity.
 - Avian ovomucoids, which consist of three Kazal-type domains.
 - Chicken ovoinhibitor, which consists of seven Kazal-type domains.
 - Bdellin B-3, a leech trypsin inhibitor.
 - LDTI [4], a leech tryptase inhibitor.
 - An eel peptide, which is probably a pancreatic serine proteinase inhibitor.
 - An elastase inhibitor from a sea anemone.
 - Rhodniin,  a thrombin inhibitor from the insect Rhodnius prolixus [5]. This
   protein consists of two Kazal-type domains.
 - Pig  intestinal  peptide  PEC-60 [6]. This protein, while highly similar to
   other members  of  the  Kazal  family,  does  not seem to act as a protease
   inhibitor. Its  exact biological function is not yet established, but it is
   known to  inhibit  the  glucose-induced  insulin  secretion  from  perfused
   pancreas and to play a role in the immune system.

The  pattern  we  developed  to  pick  up Kazal-type inhibitors spans a region
beginning  with  the  second  cysteine  and ending with the fifth one. We also
developed a profile that covers the entire Kazal domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(4)-{C}-x(2)-C-x-{A}-x(4)-Y-x(3)-C-x(2,3)-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for the sea anemone inhibitor which has six residues between the last two Cys
 of the pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This pattern  will fail  to detect the first of the three Kazal domains
 in some of the ovomucoids and the second domain of rhodniin.
