* Phycobilisome (PBS) linker domain profile *
*********************************************

Phycobilisomes (PBSs)  are the major light-harvesting systems in cyanobacteria
and red  algae.  PBS  is a supercomplex that is composed of a core complex and
multiple peripheral rod complexes. Typically, the core consists of two or five
cylinders lying  on  the membrane with, in most cases, multiple rods radiating
from the  core  to  form  a hemidiscoidal structure. The building units of the
core cylinders  and  the  peripheral rods are trimeric and hexameric discs, in
which a  monomer  consists of a pair of related phycobiliproteins (PBPs), such
as phycorerythrins,  phycoerythrocyanins,  phycocyanins, and allophycocyanins.
The discs are connected to each other via specific linker polypeptides to form
peripheral rods  or  core  cylinders.  Linker  polypeptides  share a conserved
domain of ~180 residues, which can be present in one or multiple copies [1,5].

The profile we developed covers the entire PBS linker domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
