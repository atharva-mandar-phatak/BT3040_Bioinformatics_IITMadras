* RPW8 domain profile *
***********************

Plant diseases  resistance  (R)  proteins  control the recognition of specific
pathogens and  activate  subsequent  defense responses. The R protein-mediated
defenses typically  involve  a  rapid,  localized  necrosis, or hypersensitive
response (HR),  at  the  site  of  infection,  and  the localized formation of
antimicrobial chemicals and proteins that restrict growth of the pathogen. The
Arabidopsis proteins  RPW8.1  and  RPW8.2  confer broad-spectrum resistance to
powdery mildew pathogens. They share similarity with an ~150 amino acid module
forming the N-terminus of a group of disease resistance proteins, which have a
nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) [1,2].

The RPW8  domain  sequences predicted an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) region,
or possibly a signal peptide, and a coiled-coil (CC) motif [1].

Some proteins known to contain a RPW8 domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis thaliana RPW8.1 and RPW8.2.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana Homologous to RPW8 1 (HR1), 2 (HR2) and 3 (HR3).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana activated disease resistance protein 1 (ADR1).
 - Brassica HRa, HRb and Hrc.

The profile we developed covers the entire RPW8 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
