* Omega-agatoxin type II and III signature *
********************************************

The spider  venoms  often  contain  many  active peptides such as neurotoxins,
lectins, inhibitors  to  enzyme,  etc.  These  peptides are very important for
spider's hunting  and  defending. During the long history of spider evolution,
the peptides  evolved  into  different structures and functions. Spider venoms
possess a  diverse array of peptide toxins composed of high number of cysteine
residues varying  from  6  to  14  [1].  Several  peptide toxins, collectively
referred to as omega-toxins, block with differential selectivity the different
types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Omega-agatoxins from  Agelenopsis aperta are small disulfide rich polypeptides
which are  grouped  in  different  classes  according to their pharmacological
properties against  N,  L  and  P/Q calcium currents. Some omega-agatoxins are
very specific  such  as  type I, II and IV omega-agatoxins, which respectively
block L,  N  and  P  currents. Type III omega-agatoxins are less selective and
block both N and L currents with the same potency. Type II and type III omega-
agatoxins have  clear  similarity  regarding the location of cysteine residues
which have a C-x(6)-C-x(6,8)-C-x-C-C-x(5)-C arrangement [2,3].

The following spider toxins contain the same cysteine arrangement:

 - Agelenopsis  aperta  (funnel-web  spider)  omega-agatoxin  (omega-Aga)-IIA,
   -IIIA, -IIIB, -IIIC and -IIID.
 - Phoneutria  nigriventer  (brazilian  armed spider) omega-phonetoxin (omega-
   Ptx)-IIA and  PNTx22C5 [4].
 - Phoneutria reidyi (Brazilian Amazonian armed spider) neurotoxin PRTx18C2.
 - Ancylometes sp. (South American fishing spider) neurotoxin ANC32C7.

The pattern  we  have  developed for this cysteine arrangement covers the last
four cysteines.

-Conserved pattern: C-Q-C-C-x(2)-N-[GA]-[FY]-C-S
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Type  I  and IV omega-agatoxins are unrelated to type II and III omega-
 agatoxins. They  have different cysteine arrangements (respectively C-x(6)-C-
 x-C-x(6)-C-x-C-x(11)-C-x-C-x(7)-C-x(5)-C and C-x(7)-C-x(6)-C-C-x(4)-C-x(6)-C-
 x-C) [2,3].
