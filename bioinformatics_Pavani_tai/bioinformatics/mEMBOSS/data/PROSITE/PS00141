* Eukaryotic and viral aspartyl proteases signature and profile *
*****************************************************************

Aspartyl  proteases, also  known as acid proteases, (EC 3.4.23.-) are a widely
distributed family   of   proteolytic   enzymes  [1,2,3]  known  to  exist  in
vertebrates, fungi, plants, retroviruses and some plant viruses.     Aspartate
proteases of  eukaryotes are  monomeric  enzymes which consist of two domains.
Each domain contains an  active site centered on a catalytic aspartyl residue.
The two  domains  most  probably  evolved from the duplication of an ancestral
gene encoding   a  primordial  domain.  Currently  known  eukaryotic  aspartyl
proteases are:

 - Vertebrate gastric pepsins A and C (also known as gastricsin).
 - Vertebrate  chymosin  (rennin),  involved  in digestion and used for making
   cheese.
 - Vertebrate lysosomal cathepsins D (EC 3.4.23.5) and E (EC 3.4.23.34).
 - Mammalian renin (EC 3.4.23.15) whose function  is to generate angiotensin I
   from angiotensinogen in the plasma.
 - Fungal proteases such as aspergillopepsin A (EC 3.4.23.18),   candidapepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.24), mucoropepsin (EC 3.4.23.23) (mucor rennin),  endothiapepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.22),   polyporopepsin    (EC 3.4.23.29),    and   rhizopuspepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.21).
 - Yeast saccharopepsin (EC 3.4.23.25)  (proteinase A)  (gene PEP4).   PEP4 is
   implicated in posttranslational regulation of vacuolar hydrolases.
 - Yeast  barrierpepsin  (EC 3.4.23.35)  (gene BAR1);  a protease that cleaves
   alpha-factor and thus acts as an antagonist of the mating pheromone.
 - Fission  yeast sxa1 which is involved in degrading or processing the mating
   pheromones.

Most retroviruses and some plant  viruses, such as badnaviruses, encode for an
aspartyl protease  which  is an homodimer of  a chain of about 95 to 125 amino
acids. In  most  retroviruses, the  protease  is  encoded  as  a  segment of a
polyprotein which  is  cleaved  during the maturation process of the virus. It
is generally  part  of  the  pol  polyprotein  and,  more  rarely,  of the gag
polyprotein.

Conservation of  the sequence around the two aspartates of eukaryotic aspartyl
proteases and  around  the single active site of the viral proteases allows us
to  develop a single signature pattern for both groups of protease.  A profile
was developed  to  specifically  detect  viral  aspartyl  proteases, which are
missed by the pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFGAC]-[LIVMTADN]-[LIVFSA]-D-[ST]-G-[STAV]-[STAPDENQ]-
                    {GQ}-[LIVMFSTNC]-{EGK}-[LIVMFGTA]
                    [D is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 37.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL viral-
 type proteases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.

-Note: These  proteins  belong  to families A1 and A2 in the classification of
 peptidases [4,E1].

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
