* PTS HPr domain profile and phosphorylation sites signatures *
***************************************************************

The histidine-containing  phosphocarrier  protein (HPr) is a central component
of the  phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent  sugar  phosphotransferase  system (PTS)
[1,2], which  transfers  metabolic  carbohydrates  across the cell membrane in
many bacterial  species.  The  PTS  catalyzes  the phosphorylation of incoming
sugar substrates   concomitant   with  their  translocation  across  the  cell
membrane. The  general  mechanism of the PTS is as follows: a phosphoryl group
from phosphoenolpyruvate  (PEP)  is  transferred  to  Enzyme I (EI) of the PTS
which in  turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr
then transfers  the  phosphoryl  group  to  a  sugar-specific permease complex
(enzymes EII/EIII).

HPr [3-5]  is  a small cytoplasmic protein of 70 to 90 amino acid residues. In
some bacteria  HPr  is  a domain in a larger protein that includes a EIII(Fru)
(IIA) domain  (see  <PDOC00528>)  and  in  some  cases  also  the EI domain. A
conserved histidine in the N-terminal section of HPr serves as an acceptor for
the phosphoryl  group  of  EI. In the central part of HPr there is a conserved
serine which,  in  Gram-positive  bacteria  only, is phosphorylated by an ATP-
dependent protein  kinase;  a process which probably play a regulatory role in
sugar transport.

The overall architecture of the HPr domain has been described as an open faced
beta-sandwich in which a beta-sheet is packed against three alpha-helices (see
<PDB:1FU0>). Regulatory  phosphorylation at the conserved Ser residue does not
appear to  induce large structural changes to the HPr domain, in particular in
the region of the active site [6,7].

We developed a profile which covers the entire HPr domain. The sequence around
both phosphorylation  sites  are  well  conserved and can be used as signature
patterns for HPr domains.
