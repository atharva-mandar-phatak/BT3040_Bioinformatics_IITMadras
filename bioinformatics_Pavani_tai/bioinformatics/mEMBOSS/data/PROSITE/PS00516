* Alkylbase DNA glycosidases alkA family signature *
****************************************************

Alkylbase DNA glycosidases [1] are  DNA repair  enzymes  that   hydrolyzes the
deoxyribose N-glycosidic bond to excise various alkylated bases from a damaged
DNA polymer.

In Escherichia coli there  are  two alkylbase DNA glycosidases: one (gene tag)
which is constitutively expressed and  which is specific for the removal of 3-
methyladenine (EC 3.2.2.20),  and  one (gene alkA)  which  is  induced  during
adaptation to alkylation and which can remove a variety of alkylation products
(EC 3.2.2.21). Tag and alkA do not share any region of sequence similarity.

In yeast there is  an alkylbase DNA glycosidase (gene MAG1) [2,3],  which  can
remove 3-methyladenine or 7-methyladenine and which is structurally related to
alkA.

MAG and alkA are both proteins of about 300 amino acid residues.  While the C-
and N-terminal ends appear to be unrelated, there is a central region of about
130 residues which is well conserved.  As a signature pattern we have selected
part of this region.

-Consensus pattern: G-[IV]-[GK]-x-W-[ST]-[AVI]-x-[LIVMFY](2)-x-[LIVM]-x(8)-
                    [MF]-x(2)-[ED]-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
