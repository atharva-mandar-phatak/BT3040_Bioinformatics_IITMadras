* Heat shock hsp70 proteins family signatures *
***********************************************

Prokaryotic   and  eukaryotic  organisms   respond  to  heat  shock  or  other
environmental  stress  by  the  induction   of   the  synthesis   of  proteins
collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1].  Amongst them is a family
of proteins  with  an  average   molecular weight of 70 Kd, known as the hsp70
proteins [2,3,4].  In most species, there are many proteins that belong to the
hsp70 family.  Some  of them are  expressed under unstressed conditions. Hsp70
proteins can  be found in different cellular compartments (nuclear, cytosolic,
mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.). Some of the hsp70 family proteins
are listed below:

 - In Escherichia coli and other bacteria, the main hsp70  protein is known as
   the dnaK  protein.  A  second  protein, hscA, has been recently discovered.
   dnaK is also found in the chloroplast genome of red algae.
 - In yeast, at least ten hsp70 proteins  are  known  to exist:  SSA1 to SSA4,
   SSB1, SSB2, SSC1, SSD1 (KAR2), SSE1 (MSI3) and SSE2.
 - In Drosophila, there are  at least eight  different  hsp70 proteins: HSP70,
   HSP68, and HSC-1 to HSC-6.
 - In  mammals,  there  are at least eight different proteins: HSPA1 to HSPA6,
   HSC70, and  GRP78  (also  known  as  the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding
   protein (BiP)).
 - In the sugar beet yellow virus (SBYV),  a hsp70  homolog has been shown [5]
   to exist.
 - In archaebacteria, hsp70 proteins are also present [6].

All proteins belonging to the hsp70 family bind ATP.   A variety  of functions
has  been postulated for  hsp70 proteins.  It now appears  [7] that some hsp70
proteins play an important role in the transport of proteins across membranes.
They also  seem    to  be    involved in protein  folding and in the assembly/
disassembly of protein complexes [8].

We have derived three signature patterns for the hsp70 family of proteins; the
first centered on a conserved  pentapeptide found in the N-terminal section of
these proteins;  the  two  others  on conserved regions located in the central
part of the sequence.

-Consensus pattern: [IV]-D-L-G-T-[ST]-x-[SC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 16 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMF]-[LIVMFY]-[DN]-[LIVMFS]-G-[GSH]-[GS]-[AST]-x(3)-
                    [ST]-[LIVM]-[LIVMFC]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 7 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMY]-x-[LIVMF]-x-G-G-x-[ST]-{LS}-[LIVM]-P-x-[LIVM]-x-
                    [DEQKRSTA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 4 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 6.
