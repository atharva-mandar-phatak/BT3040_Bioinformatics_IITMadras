* Aromatic amino acids permeases signature *
********************************************

It has been shown [1] that some proteins involved in the transport of aromatic
amino acids in Escherichia coli and related bacteria are evolutionary related;
these permeases are:

 - Tryptophan-specific transport protein (tryptophan permease) (gene mtr).
 - Low affinity tryptophan permease (gene tnaB or trpP).
 - Tyrosine-specific transport protein (tyrosine permease) (gene tyrP).
 - Tyrosine permease from Erwinia herbicola (gene: tutB).

These permeases are proteins of  about 400 to 420 amino  acids  which probably
contain 11 or 12 transmembrane regions. The best conserved domain is a stretch
of 20 residues which seems to be  located  in a cytoplasmic  loop  between the
first and second transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: I-G-[GA]-G-M-[LF]-[SA]-x-P-x(3)-[SA]-G-x(2)-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
