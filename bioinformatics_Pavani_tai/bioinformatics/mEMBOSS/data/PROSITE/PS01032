* Protein phosphatase 2C signature *
************************************

Protein phosphatase  2C  (PP2C)  is one of the four major classes of mammalian
serine/threonine  specific protein  phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.16).  PP2C [1] is a
monomeric enzyme  of about 42 Kd which shows   broad substrate specificity and
is dependent  on  divalent  cations  (mainly  manganese and magnesium) for its
activity. Its  exact  physiological  role is still unclear. Three isozymes are
currently known  in mammals: PP2C-alpha, -beta and -gamma. In yeast, there are
at least  four  PP2C  homologs:  phosphatase  PTC1 [2] which has weak tyrosine
phosphatase activity in addition to its activity on serines, phosphatases PTC2
and PTC3,  and  hypothetical  protein YBR125c. Isozymes of PP2C are also known
from Arabidopsis   thaliana   (ABI1,  PPH1),  Caenorhabditis  elegans  (FEM-2,
F42G9.1, T23F11.1), Leishmania chagasi and Paramecium tetraurelia.

In Arabidopsis  thaliana, the kinase associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) [3]
is an  enzyme  that dephosphorylates the Ser/Thr receptor-like kinase RLK5 and
which contains a C-terminal PP2C domain.

PP2C does  not  seem  to be evolutionary related to the main family of serine/
threonine phosphatases:  PP1,  PP2A  and  PP2B . However,  it is significantly
similar  to  the  catalytic   subunit  of  pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide)-
phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.43)  (PDPC)  [4],  which catalyzes dephosphorylation and
concomitant reactivation of  the alpha  subunit of  the E1  component  of  the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. PDPC is a mitochondrial enzyme and, like PP2C,
is magnesium-dependent.

As a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region which is located
in the  N-terminal  part  and  contains a perfectly conserved tripeptide. This
region includes  a  conserved  aspartate  residue  involved in divalent cation
binding [5].

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY]-[LIVMFYA]-[GSAC]-[LIVM]-[FYC]-D-G-H-[GAV]
                    [The D is a manganese ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: PP2C  belongs  [6]  to  a  superfamily  which  also  includes bacterial
 proteins such  as Bacillus spoIIE, rsbU and rsbW, Synechocystis PCC 6803 icfG
 as well as a domain in fungal adenylate cyclases.
