* Galactokinase signature *
***************************

Galactokinase  (EC 2.7.1.6) [1]  catalyzes  the  first reaction  of  galactose
metabolism,  the  conversion  of  galactose  to  galactose 1-phosphate.  There
are three well conserved regions in the sequence of eukaryotic and prokaryotic
galactokinase.  As a signature pattern we have selected the  best conserved of
these regions, which is located in the N-terminal section of galactokinase.

In yeast the GAL3 protein [2] is required for rapid induction of the galactose
system. The exact function of GAL3 is not known, but it may be involved in the
production of a true inducer or coinducer  molecule.   The sequence of GAL3 is
closely related to that of galactokinases.

-Consensus pattern: G-R-x-N-[LIV]-I-G-[DE]-H-x-D-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: See also the section describing the pattern  for  the GHMP kinases ATP-
 binding domain <PDOC00545>.

-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
