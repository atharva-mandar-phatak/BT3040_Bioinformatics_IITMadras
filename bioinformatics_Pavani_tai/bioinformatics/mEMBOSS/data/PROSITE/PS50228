* SUEL-type lectin domain profile *
***********************************

Lectins bind   to   specific   carbohydrate   residues  of  glycoproteins  and
glycolipids present  at  the  cell  surface.  This allow them to agglutinate a
variety of  cellular  types.  On  the  basis of sequence similarity and common
characteristics such  as  sugar  binding  specificity,  conserved carbohydrate
recognition domains,  and ion requirement the different lectins can be grouped
in different categories, like C-type, I-type, galectins, pentraxins and P-type
lectin.

The sea  urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) egg lectin (SUEL) forms a new class
of lectins.  Altough SUEL was first isolated as a D-galactoside binding lectin
it was  latter  shown  that  it  bind  to  L-rhamnose preferentially [1,2]. L-
rhamnose and  D-galactose  share the same hydroxyl group orientation at C2 and
C4 of  the pyranose ring structure. SUEL is a lectin that exist as a disulfide
linked homodimer.  The dimeric form is essential for hemagglutination activity
but the  monomeric  form  retains  carbohydrate binding capacity [1]. Based on
primary structure  analysis,  a  cysteine-rich  domain  homologous to the SUEL
protein has been identified in the following proteins [3,4,5]:

 - Plant  beta-galactosidases  (EC 3.2.1.23)  (lactases).  They  constitute  a
   widespread family  of  enzymes  characterized by their ability to hydrolyse
   terminal, non-reducing beta D-galactosyl residues from beta-D-galactosides.
 - Mammalian     latrophilin,  the  calcium  independent  receptor  of  alpha-
   latrotoxin (CIRL).  It  belongs to the secretin family of G-protein coupled
   receptors. The  lectin  domain is not required for alpha-latratoxin binding
   [5].
 - Human lectomedin-1.
 - Rhamnose-binding  lectin (SAL) from catfish (Parasilurus asotus) eggs. This
   protein is  composed  of three tandem repeat domains homologous to the SUEL
   lectin domain.  All  cysteine  positions  of  each  domain  are  completely
   conserved [2].
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   hypothetical   proteins  B0457.1,  F32A7.3A  and
   F32A7.3B.
 - Human hypothetical protein KIAA0821.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
