* Transmembrane 4 family signature *
************************************

Recently a number of eukaryotic  cell  surface  antigens have been found to be
evolutionary related [1,2,3]. The proteins known  to belong to this family are
listed below:

 - Mammalian antigen CD9 (MIC3); a protein involved in platelet activation and
   aggregation.
 - Mammalian leukocyte antigen CD37, expressed on B lymphocytes.
 - Mammalian leukocyte antigen CD53 (OX-44),  which may be involved in  growth
   regulation in hematopoietic cells.
 - Mammalian lysosomal  membrane  protein  CD63  (Melanoma-associated  antigen
   ME491; antigen AD1).
 - Mammalian antigen CD81  (Cell surface protein TAPA-1),  which  may  play an
   important role in the regulation of lymphoma cell growth.
 - Mammalian  antigen  CD82  (Protein R2; Antigen C33; Kangai 1 (KAI1)), which
   associates with  CD4  or  CD8  and  delivers  costimulatory signals for the
   TCR/CD3 pathway.
 - Mammalian  antigen  CD151 (SFA-1;  Platelet-endothelial tetraspan antigen 3
   (PETA-3)).
 - Mammalian TM4SF2 (Cell surface glycoprotein A15; TALLA-1; MXS1).
 - Mammalian TM4SF3 (Tumor-associated antigen CO-029).
 - Mammalian TM4SF6 (Tspan-6; TM4-D).
 - Mammalian TM4SF7 (Novel antigen 2 (NAG-2); Tspan-4).
 - Mammalian Tspan-2.
 - Mammalian Tspan-3 (TM4-A).
 - Mammalian Tetraspan NET-5.
 - Schistosoma mansoni and japonicum 23 Kd surface antigen (SM23 / SJ23).

These proteins  share  the following characteristics: they all seem to be type
III membrane  proteins  (type III proteins are integral membrane proteins that
contain a  N-terminal  membrane-anchoring  domain  which is not cleaved during
biosynthesis and  which  functions  both  as  a  translocation signal and as a
membrane anchor); they  also  contain  three additional transmembrane regions,
at least  seven  conserved  cysteines residues, and are  of  approximately the
same size  (218 to 284 residues). These proteins are collectively  know as the
'transmembrane 4  superfamily'  (TM4)  because they span the  plasma  membrane
four times.  A  schematic diagram of the domain structure of these proteins is
shown below.

 +-+-----+-------+----+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+----+
 | | TMa | Extra | TM2| Cyt | TM3 | Extracellular               | TM4 | Cyt|
 +-+-----+-------+----C-----C-----+--------CC---------C-----C---+-----C----+
                     *********

Cyt       : cytoplasmic domain.
TMa       : transmembrane anchor.
TM2 to TM4: transmembrane regions 2 to 4.
'C'       : conserved cysteine.
'*'       : position of the pattern.

As a  signature  for  these  proteins,  we  selected  a  conserved region that
includes two  cysteines  and  seems  to be located in a short cytoplasmic loop
between two transmembrane domains.

-Consensus pattern: [GC]-x(3)-[LIVMFS]-x(2)-[GSA]-[LIVMFTC]-[LIVMFA]-G-[CLYI]-
                    x-[GA]-[STAPL]-x(2)-[EGAR]-x(2)-[CWNLF]-[LIVMGA]-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Mammalian uroplakin IA/IB, TM4SF1 (L6), TM4SF4 (il-TMP), TM4SF5, Tspan-
 1, Tspan-5  are  proteins  that are distantly related to this family and that
 are not found by the above pattern.
