* Rubredoxin signature *
************************

Rubredoxins [1] are small electron-transfer prokaryotic proteins. They contain
an iron atom which is ligated  by  four cysteine residues. Rubredoxins are, in
some cases, functionally  interchangeable with  ferredoxins.  As a pattern for
these proteins we have selected a conserved  region  that  includes two of the
cysteine residues that bind the iron atom.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-{G}-{R}-W-x-C-P-x-C-[AGD]
                    [The 2 C's bind the iron atom]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note: In Pseudomonas oleovorans rubredoxin 2 (gene alkG) [2], this pattern is
 found twice because alkG has two rubredoxin domains.
-Note: Rubrerythrin [3], a  protein  with  inorganic pyrophosphatase  activity
 from Desulfovibrio  vulgaris  possesses  a C-terminal rubredoxin-like domain.
 But this domain is too divergent to be detected by the above pattern.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
