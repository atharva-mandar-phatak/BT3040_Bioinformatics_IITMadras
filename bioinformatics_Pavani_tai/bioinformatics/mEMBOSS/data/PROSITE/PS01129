* Rlu family of pseudouridine synthase signature *
**************************************************

The following  proteins,  which  seems  to belong to a family of pseudouridine
synthases (EC 5.4.99.-) [1] have been shown to share regions of similarities:

 - Escherichia   coli  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  ribosomal  large  subunit
   pseudouridine synthase  A  (gene  rluA). It is responsible for synthesis of
   pseudouridine from uracil-746 IN 23S rRNA.
 - Escherichia    coli  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  ribosomal  large subunit
   pseudouridine synthase  C  (gene  rluC). It is responsible for synthesis of
   pseudouridine from uracil at positions 955, 2504 and 2580 in 23S rRNA.
 - Escherichia coli protein and homologs in other bacteria large subunit
   pseudouridine synthase D (gene rluD).
 - Yeast DRAP deaminase (gene RIB2).
 - Escherichia  coli  and Haemophilus influenzae tRNA pseudouridine synthase C
   (truC).
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0042.
 - Aquifex aeolicus hypothetical protein AQ_1758.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yhcT.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yjbO.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ylyB.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0347.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0745.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0956.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG209.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG370.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1592.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1629.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDL036c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR169c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC18B11.02c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K07E8.7.

These are    proteins  of from 21 to 50 Kd which contain a number of conserved
regions in their central section. They can be picked up in the database by the
following highly conserved pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVCA]-[NHYTQ]-R-[LI]-[DG]-x(2)-[TV]-[STAC]-G-[LIVAGC]-
                    [LIVMF](2)-[LIVMFGCA]-[SGTACV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for HP0347 and slr1592.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
