* PX domain profile *
*********************

The phox  homology  (PX)  domain is a 100-140 amino acid module that was first
identified in  p40-phox,  p47-phox,  the  Cpk class of phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase, homologues  of  a  sorting  nexin (SNX1), phospholipase D, and several
yeast proteins,  including  BEM1  and  SCD2  [1].  The PX domain is found in a
single copy   in   several  eukaryotic  proteins  generally  involved  in  the
regulation of   vesicular   trafficking   machinery,  growth  factor  receptor
degradation in  lysosomes,  signal  transduction mechanisms, and NADPH oxidase
activity. In  addition  to  proteins containing only PX domains, the PX domain
can coexist  with  other  functional  domains  such  as  the lipase, the lipid
kinase, the   protein  kinase  (see  <PDOC00100>),  the  t-SNARE  domain  (see
<PDOC50192>), the  SH3  domain  (see  <PDOC50002>),  and  the  RGS domain (see
<PDOC50132>). Several PX domains have been shown to bind phosphatidylinositol-
3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P),       phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate       or
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [2,3,4,5,6].  Thus, it seems likely that
PX domains fulfill a general function as phosphoinositide-binding domains in a
variety of cellular processes in unicellular and multicellular organisms. Many
PX domains  contain a  conserved  proline-rich  motif representing a consensus
SH3-binding site  and  an  interaction between the p47-phox PX and SH3 domains
has been shown to exist [1,7]. This  suggests  that SH3 docking might regulate
the interaction  between  PX  domains  and phosphoinositide-enriched membranes
[2].

The PX  domain  contains  several conserved positively charged and hydrophobic
residues characteristic  of  domains known to bind to specific phosphopeptides
or phospholipids.  The NMR structures of the p47-phox and VAM7 PX domains have
been solved  and  revealed  that  the  PX domain has a flat compact shape (see
<PDB:1GD5>). The  p47-phox  and  VAM7 PX domains consist of three/four strands
forming an  antiparallel  beta-sheet structure in the N-terminal  one-third of
the amino-acid structure, and four/three helices in the C-terminal two-thirds,
respectively [2,7].  The conserved proline-rich motif found in many PX domains
and which could bind SH3 domains is located between alpha-helices 1 and 2 or 2
and 3, respectively [1,2,7].

Some proteins known to contain a PX domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic  sorting nexin (SNX) proteins. They are implicated in regulating
   membrane traffic.
 - Animal Cpk class of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
 - Mouse  serine/threonine  protein  kinase  CISK.  It  is implicated in IL-3-
   dependent cell survival.
 - Mammalian  p47-phox  (NCF-1)  and  p40-phox  (NCF-4),  which  are cytosolic
   components of  the  phagocyte  NADPH  oxidase.  In human, defects in the PX
   domain of   p47-phox   cause   chronic  granulomatous  disease  (CGD)  with
   predisposition to infection by fungi and bacteria.
 - Mammalian  Fish  protein.  It is involved in the tyrosine kinase signalling
   pathway.
 - Some eukaryotic phospholipases D (EC 3.1.4.4).
 - Yeast vacuolar morphogenesis protein VAM7. It helps to transport cargo such
   as hydrolytic enzymes to the vacuole, the yeast lysosomal counterpart.
 - Yeast BEM1 and BEM3 bud-mergence proteins.
 - Fission yeast scd2, the orthologue of BEM1.

The profile we developed covers the entire PX domain.
