* PLA2c domain profile *
************************

The  PLA2c domain is the catalytic lipase domain in cytosolic phospholipase A2
(cPLA2)  (EC  3.1.1.4)  and  lysophospholipase  or  phospholipase  B (PLB) (EC
3.1.1.5)   of  vertebrates  and  fungi.  It  catalyzes  the  carboxylic  ester
hydrolysis  of  glycerophospholipids or lysophospholipids. The mammalian cPLA2
group IVA enzymes cleave intracellular phospholipid membranes to produce lipid
mediators,  which also play a role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma and
arthritis.  This  enzyme  contains a N-terminal calcium-binding C2 domain (see
<PDOC00380>)  that  presents  the catalytic domain to the membrane [1]. Fungal
secreted   lysophospholipase/PLB   can   possess   three  different  enzymatic
activities,  the  hydrolase activity of phospholipase, lysophospholipase and a
lysophospholipase transacylase activity.

The  3D  structure  of  the PLA2c domain forms a central core of a 10-stranded
mixed  beta sheet surrounded by 9 alpha helices (see <PDB:1CJY>). This central
alpha/beta  core  resembles  the  alpha/beta hydrolase fold, but an additional
180-residue patch between strands 9 and 10 forms a catalytic domain 'cap' [2].
Ser  228  and  Asp 549 of human cPLA2 alpha form the potential catalytic dyad.
Parts  of  the cap-region are poorly conserved and are distinct among isoforms
[3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a PLA2c domain:

 - Mammalian   cytosolic  phospholipase  A2  (cPLA2)  alpha/group  IVA,  which
   releases   arachidonic   acid   from   the   sn-2   position   of  membrane
   glycerophospholipids  and  initiates  the  biosynthesis  of prostaglandins,
   leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor.
 - Mammalian  cytosolic  phospholipase  A2  (cPLA2)  gamma/group IVC, which is
   implicated in the remodeling of membrane phospholipids.
 - Fungal  lysophospholipases/PLB,  which  are  considered to be important for
   virulence of pathogenic fungi.
 - Yeast sporulation-specific protein 1 (SPO1), which is required for meiosis.

The profile we developed covers the entire PLA2c domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
