* Glycosyl hydrolases family 17 signature *
*******************************************

It has  been  shown  [1,2]  that  the  following  glycosyl  hydrolases  can be
classified into a single family on the basis of sequence similarities:

 - Glucan  endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidases    (EC 3.2.1.39)    (endo-(1->3)-beta-
   glucanase) from various plants.  This enzyme may be involved in the defense
   of plants against pathogens through its ability to degrade fungal cell wall
   polysaccharides.
 - Glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.58)  (exo-(1->3)-beta-glucanase) from
   yeast (gene BGL2). This enzyme  may play  a  role  in cell expansion during
   growth, in cell-cell  fusion  during  mating,  and  in spore release during
   sporulation.
 - Lichenases (EC 3.2.1.73)   (endo-(1->3,1->4)-beta-glucanase)  from  various
   plants.

The best conserved region in the sequence of these enzymes is located in their
central section. This  region  contains  a  conserved tryptophan residue which
could be involved in  the  interaction with  the  glucan substrates [2] and it
also contains  a  conserved  glutamate  which has been shown [3] to act as the
nucleophile in  the  catalytic  mechanism.  We  have  used  this  region  as a
signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMKS]-x-[LIVMFYWA](3)-[STAG]-E-[STACVI]-G-[WY]-P-[STN]-
                    x-[SAGQ]
                    [E is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
