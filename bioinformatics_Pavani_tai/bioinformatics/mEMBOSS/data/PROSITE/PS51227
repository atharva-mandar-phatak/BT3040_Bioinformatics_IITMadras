* Sprouty (SPR) domain profile *
********************************

Sprouty  (Spry)  and  Spred  (Sprouty  related EVH1 domain) proteins have been
identified  as  inhibitors  of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade, a pathway crucial for developmental processes initiated by activation
of  various receptor tyrosine kinases [1,2]. These proteins share a conserved,
C-terminal  cysteine-rich region, the SPR domain. This domain has been defined
as  a  novel  cytosol  to membrane translocation domain [1,2,3,4]. It has been
found  to  be  a  PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding  domain that targets the proteins to a
cellular localization that maximizes their inhibitory potential [5,6]. It also
mediates homodimer formation of these proteins [1,5].

The  SPR domain can occur in association with the WH1 domain (see <PDOC50229>)
(located in the N-terminal part of the proteins) in the Spred proteins.

We developed a profile that spans the entire SPR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The SPR domain is also named Spry translocation domain (SpryTD).
