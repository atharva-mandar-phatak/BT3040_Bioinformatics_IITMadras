* Scorpion short toxin chloride channel inhibitor subfamily profile *
*********************************************************************

Short scorpion  toxin  chloride channel inhibitors are short-chain neurotoxins
(SCNs) (see  <PDOC00875>),  which  block  small-conductance chloride channels.
They are 30-40-residue long and contain four intramolecular disulfide bridges,
which have been assigned as C1-C4, C2-C6, C3-C7 and C5-C8 [1-3].

The global  fold  of  the  scorpion  short  toxin  chloride  channel inhibitor
subfamily is   an   alpha-helix  packed  on  a  two-stranded  beta-sheet  (see
<PDB:1CHL>). The structure also contains a short fragment in an extended form.
The two  antiparalllel  beta-strands  are connected by a type I beta-turn. The
four disulfide  bridges  help  to maintain a very compact structure by heavily
attaching the N-terminal and C-terminal ends to the alpha-helix [1-3].

The scorpion short toxin chloride channel inhibitor subfamily includes:

 - Buthus sindicus chlorotoxin-like peptide Bs8 and Bs 14.
 - Mesobuthus  martensii  (Manchurian  scorpion)  short-chain Cl-channel toxin
   (BmKCT) and Neurotoxin Bm12-b from (Buthus martensii)
 - Buthus eupeus (Lesser Asian scorpion) insectotoxin BeI3, BeI4 and BeI5.
 - Parabuthus schlechteri (Scorpion) toxin PBITx1 (sITx10).
 - Leiurus  quinquestriatus  quinquestriatus  (Egyptian  scorpion) chlorotoxin
   (CTX).
 - Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus (Yellow scorpion) probable toxin Lqh-8/6.
 - Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus (Scorpion) neurotoxin P2.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / First entry.
