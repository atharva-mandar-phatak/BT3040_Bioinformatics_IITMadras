* Ferredoxin reductase-type FAD-binding domain profile *
********************************************************

Flavoenzymes  have  the  ability  to  catalyse  a  wide  range  of biochemical
reactions.   They  are  involved  in  the  dehydrogenation  of  a  variety  of
metabolites,  in  electron  transfer  from  and  to  redox  centres,  in light
emission,  in  the  activation  of  oxygen  for  oxidation  and  hydroxylation
reactions  [1,2].  About  1%  of  all  eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are
predicted  to  encode  a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain [3].
According   to   structural   similarities   and  conserved  sequence  motifs,
FAD-binding  domains  have  been  grouped  in  three  main  families:  (i) the
ferredoxin  reductase  (FR)-type  FAD-binding  domain,  (ii)  the FAD-binding
domains  that adopt a Rossmann fold and (iii) the PCMH-type FAD-binding domain
[4].

The  FAD  cofactor  consists of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) linked to flavin
mononucleotide  (FMN)  by  a pyrophosphate bond. The AMP moiety is composed of
the  adenine  ring bonded to a ribose that is linked to a phosphate group. The
FMN  moiety  is composed of the isoalloxazine-flavin ring linked to a ribitol,
which  is  connected  to  a  phosphate group. The flavin functions mainly in a
redox  capacity,  being  able  to take up two electrons from one substrate and
release  them two at a time to a substrate or coenzyme, or one at a time to an
electron  acceptor.  The  catalytic function of the FAD is concentrated in the
isoalloxazine  ring,  whereas  the ribityl phosphate and the AMP moiety mainly
stabilize cofactor binding to protein residues [1,2].

The  structural  core  of  all  FR  family  members  is  well  conserved.  The
FAD-binding  fold characteristic of the FR family is a cylindrical beta-domain
with  a  flattened  six-stranded  antiparallel  beta-barrel organized into two
orthogonal  sheets  (B1-B2-B5  and B4-B3-B6) separated by one alpha-helix (see
for  example  <PDB:IA8P>)  [5]. The cylinder is open between strands B4 and B5
which  makes  space for the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FAD. One
end  of  the  cylinder  is  covered  by the only helix of the domain, which is
essential  for  the  binding  of  the  pyrophosphate groups of the FAD. The FR
family contains two conserved motifs, one (R-x-Y-[ST]) located in B4 where the
invariant  positively  charge Arg residue forms hydrogen bonds to the negative
pyrophosphate   oxygen   atom.   The   other   conserved   sequence  motif  is
G-x(2)-[ST]-x(2)-L-x(5)-G-x(7)-P-x-G,  which  is part of H1-B6 and is known as
the phosphate-binding motif [4,5].

Some  proteins known to contain a FR-type FAD-binding domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. It is a membrane-bound hemoprotein
   which acts as an electron carrier for several membrane-bound oxygenases.
 - Eukaryotic  NADPH-cytochrome  P450  reductase.  This enzyme is required for
   electron  transfer  from NADP to cytochrome P450 in microsomes. It can also
   provide electron transfer to heme oxygenase and cytochrome b5.
 - Nitrate reductase. It is a key enzyme involved in the first step of nitrate
   assimilation in plants, fungi and bacteria.
 - Bacterial  ferredoxin reductase. It transports electrons between flavodoxin
   or  ferredoxin  and  NADPH.  It  is involved in the reductive activation of
   cobalamin-independent  methionine  synthase,  pyruvate  formate  lyase  and
   anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase.
 - Bacterial  flavohemoprotein.  It is involved in nitric oxide detoxification
   in an aerobic process, termed nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) reaction.
 - Bacterial  Na(+)-translocating  NADH-quinone reductase (NQR) subunit F. NQR
   complex  catalyzes  the  reduction  of  ubiquinone-1  to  ubiquinol  by two
   successive  reactions,  coupled  with  the transport of Na(+) ions from the
   cytoplasm to the periplasm.

The   profile   we  developed  covers  the  whole  ferredoxin  reductase  type
FAD-binding domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note:  In  addition  to  the FAD-binding domain, all of the FR family members
 have an NAD(P)H-binding domain.
