* Osteopontin signature *
*************************

Osteopontin is  an  acidic phosphorylated glycoprotein of about 40 Kd which is
abundant in   the   mineral  matrix  of  bones  and  which  binds  tightly  to
hydroxyapatite [1,2,3].  It  is suggested that osteopontin might function as a
cell attachment  factor    and  could  play  a  key  role  in  the adhesion of
osteoclasts to the mineral matrix of bone.

Osteopontin-K is a  kidney protein  which is highly similar to osteopontin and
probably also involved in cell-adhesion.

As a  signature  pattern  we selected a highly conserved region located at the
N-terminal extremity of the mature protein.

-Consensus pattern: [KQ]-x-[TA]-x(2)-[GA]-S-S-E-E-K
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: June 1994 / Text revised.
