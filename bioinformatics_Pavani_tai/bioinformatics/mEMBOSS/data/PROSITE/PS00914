******************************************
* Syntaxin / epimorphin family signature *
******************************************

The following proteins have been shown to be evolutionary related [1,2,3]:

 - Epimorphin (or syntaxin 2),  a mammalian mesenchymal protein which plays an
   essential role in epithelial morphogenesis.
 - Syntaxin  1A  (also  known  as  antigen  HPC-1)  and  syntaxin 1B which are
   synaptic proteins  which may be involved in docking of synaptic vesicles at
   presynaptic active zones.
 - Syntaxin 3.
 - Syntaxin  4,  which is potentially involved in docking of synaptic vesicles
   at presynaptic active zones.
 - Syntaxin 5, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport.
 - Syntaxin 6, which is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
 - Syntaxin 7.
 - Yeast  PEP12  (or VPS6) which is required for the transport of proteases to
   the vacuole.
 - Yeast  SED5 which is required for the fusion of transport vesicles with the
   Golgi complex.
 - Yeast SSO1 and SSO2  which are  required for vesicle fusion with the plasma
   membrane.
 - Yeast VAM3, which is required for vacuolar assembly.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana protein KNOLLE which may be involved in cytokinesis.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F35C8.4, F48F7.2, F55A11.2 and
   T01B11.3.

The above  proteins  share  the following characteristics: a size ranging from
30 Kd  to  40  Kd;  a  C-terminal extremity which is highly hydrophobic and is
probably involved  in  anchoring  the protein to the membrane; a central, well
conserved region, which seems to be in a coiled-coil conformation.

The pattern specific for  this family is based on the most conserved region of
the coiled coil domain.
