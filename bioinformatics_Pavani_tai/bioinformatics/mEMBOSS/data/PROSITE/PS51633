**********************
* CXC domain profile *
**********************

Polycomb group  (Pc-G)  proteins  ensure  the stable inheritance of expression
patterns through cell division and regulate the control of cell proliferation.
The Enhancer of zeste (E(z))-type of Pc-G proteins includes:

 - Drosophila melanogaster Enhancer of zeste E(z).
 - Mammalian ENX-1 and ENX-2.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  CURLY  LEAF  (CLF),  a  transcriptional repressor of
   floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana CLF-like.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana MEDEA (MEA), a suppressor of endosperm development.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana EZA1.

These proteins  contain  a  SET  domain  (see  <PDOC50280>) at the C-terminus.
Unique to them is the presence of a CXC domain, an ~65-residue cys-rich region
preceding the  SET  domain.  The  spacing of 17 cyteines is conserved. The CXC
domain contains three units of C-X(6)-C-X(3)-C-X-C motif, although the most C-
terminal unit  is  reverse-oriented. Because of its evolutionary conservation,
the CXC  domain  is  likely  to  be involved in an important function of E(z)-
related proteins [1,2,3].

The CXC  domain  shows  some similarity to the CRC domain found in the tesmin/
TSO1 protein family (see <PDOC51634>) [4].

The profile we developed covers the entire CXC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
