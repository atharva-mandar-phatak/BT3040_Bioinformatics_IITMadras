* Ig-like domain profile *
**************************

The  Ig-like  domain  is  probably  the  most  widespread  domain, at least in
animals.  This  domain  can be considered as an heterogeneous group built on a
common  fold.  Proteins  containing  an  Ig-like domain differ in their tissue
distribution, amino acid composition, and biological role [1,2,3].

All  Ig-like  domains  appear to be involved in binding functions. The ligands
range  from  small  molecules  (antigens,  chromophores),  to hormones (growth
hormone, interferons, prolactin), up to giant molecules (muscle proteins) [3].
Binding  sites  are  localized  either  in the loop regions (the most variable
parts  of  the immunoglobulins) or in strands. For instance, distinct areas of
the  sheets  are  used  to  bind  the  ligands  of the MHC, CD8, CD4, and PapD
molecules  or of the growth hormone receptor (GHR). These binding sites may be
formed  by  a  single  chain  (CD2,  CD4),  by  homodimers  (GHR,  CD8), or by
heterodimers [3].

Classical  Ig-like  domains  are composed of 7 to 10 beta strands, distributed
between two sheets with typical topology and connectivity described as a Greek
key beta-barrel (see <PDB:3HLA>). The general shape of Ig-like domains is well
conserved,  but  they  can  differ significantly in their size, owing to high
variability  of  the  loops.  While  a  classical  domain  contains  about 100
residues,  smaller  ones  (74-90  residues)  have  been  observed  in  several
Ig-related  molecules  (CD2,  CD4).  Large decorations within loops, sometimes
including  extra  domains,  are  found in hemocyanin (238 amino acids) [4] and
transcription   factor   NFkappaB   (201   amino  acids)  [5].  The  schematic
representation of the structure of a typical Ig-like domain is shown below:

               ----------======D======>--
              |                          |
              |    ------<=====E=======--
              |   |

              |   |    --<=====A=======      |
              |   |                          |
              |   |                          |
              |   |      <=====G=======--    |
              |   |                      |   |
              |    ------======F======>--    |
              |                              |
               ----------<=====C=======------

     '=>': indicates the direction of the beta-strands 'A' to 'G'.

Ig-like  domains  can  be  classified according to the numbers of beta strands
[1,3]:

C1-type:  classical Ig-like domain, described in the schematic representation.
Sheet  I: ABED, sheet II: CFG. Domain C1 is found exclusively in the molecules
involved in the immune system:

 - Immunoglobulins (Ig).
 - Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.
 - T-cell receptors (TcR).

C2-type:  strand  D is deleted and replaced by strand C' directly connected to
strand E. Sheet I: ABE, sheet II: C'CFG:

 - Second domain of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.
 - Neural cell adhesion molecule 2.
 - Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3.
 - Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4.
 - Interleukin-6 receptor alpha chain.

V-type:extra  strands  C'  and C" between strand C and D. Sheet I: ABED, sheet
II: C"C'CFG:

 - Variable domain of the immunoglobulin  heavy chain.
 - T-cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha chain.
 - Viral Hemagglutinin.
 - Programed cell death protein 1.
 - Neurocan core protein.
 - Myelin protein zero.

H-type:extra strand  C'  between  strand C and D. Sheet I: ABE, sheet II: CFG.
Strand C'/D links sheet I and II:

 - N-terminal domain of cellulase c.
 - C-terminal domain of galactose oxidase.

We  developed  a profile  based on structural alignments that covers the whole
domain  and  recognizes Ig-like domains closely related to immunoglobulin. Our
profiles  does not recognise H-type or DNA binding Ig-like domains, because of
their high divergence.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: May 2003 / First entry.
