* Stress-induced proteins SRP1/TIP1 family signature *
******************************************************

It has  been  recently shown [1]  that three yeast proteins,  two of which are
known to be induced by various stress conditions, are structurally related and
are probably part of a larger family. These proteins are listed below.

 - Cold-shock  inducible  protein  TIR1  (also  known as serine-rich protein 1
   (SRP1)). TIR1 is induced by glucose [2] and cold shock [3].
 - Temperature-shock inducible protein 1 (TIP1).  TIP1 can be induced  by both
   cold and heat shocks [4].
 - Cold-shock inducible protein TIR2 (SRP2) [3].
 - Seripauperins, which are closely related protein of about 13 Kd (120 to 124
   residues) which are generally encoded at the extremity of yeast chromosomes
   [5]. The    known   members  of  this  family  are: PAU1, PAU2, PAU3, PAU4,
   PAU5, PAU6,  YBR301w,  YGL261c,  YGR294w,  YHL046c,  YIL176c,  YIR041w  and
   YKL224c.
 - Hypothetical protein YIL011w.
 - Hypothetical protein YJR150c.
 - Hypothetical protein YJR151c.

These proteins all seem to start with a putative signal sequence followed by a
conserved domain  of  about 90 residues. In TIR1, TIR2, TIP1, YIL011w, YJR150c
and YJR151c,  this  domain is followed by a repetitive serine and alanine rich
region absent in the other members of this family.

As a signature pattern for this protein family, we selected a region at the C-
terminus of the conserved domain.

-Consensus pattern: P-W-Y-[ST](2)-R-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
