* Ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases signature *
************************************************

A number  of  enzymes  responsible  for  the  dimethylation  of  adenosines in
ribosomal RNAs (EC 2.1.1.48) have been found [1,2] to be evolutionary related.
These enzymes are:

 - Bacterial  16S  rRNA  dimethylase (gene ksgA), which acts in the biogenesis
   of ribosomes  by catalyzing the dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in
   the loop  of  a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of 16S rRNA. Inactivation
   of ksgA leads to resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin.
 - Yeast  18S  rRNA  dimethylase (gene DIM1), which is functionally similar to
   ksgA and that dimethylates twin adenosines in the 3'-end of 18S rRNA.
 - Bacterial 'erm' methylases. These enzymes confer  resistance  to macrolide-
   lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics - such  as erythromycin -  by
   dimethylating the  adenine  residue  at  position  2058  of  23S  rRNA thus
   resulting in a reduced affinity between ribosomes and the MLS antibiotics.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein EO2H1.1.

The best  conserved  region  in  these  enzymes  is  located in the N-terminal
section and  corresponds  to  a region that is probably involved in S-adenosyl
methionine (SAM) binding.
