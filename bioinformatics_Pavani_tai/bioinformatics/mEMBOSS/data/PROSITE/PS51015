* YDG domain profile *
**********************

The YDG  domain  is a 150-170 amino acid long module, which has been named for
its characteristic  YDG  motif.  Further characteristics of the domain are the
conservation of up to 13 evenly spaced glycine residues and a VRV(I/V)RG motif
[1]. The  YDG  domain  is  found  in  proteins  in  combination with different
domains, some  of which connected with an irreversible enzymatic activity: SET
domain (histone  methylation)  (see  <PDOC50280>), RING finger (ubquitination)
(see <PDOC00449>), HNH domain (non-specific endonuclease reaction), PHD finger
(see <PDOC50016>),  AT  hook motif, and ubiquitin domain (see <PDOC00271>). As
the YDG domain of Np95 has been shown to be indispensable both for interaction
with histones  and  for  chromatin  binding, it has been proposed that the YDG
domain is  necessary  to  direct  to  the  chromatin a number of heterogeneous
proteins with associated enzymatic activities [2].

The YDG  domain  has  also been called SIN domain for similarity to ICBP90 and
NP95 [3].

Some proteins known to contain a YDG domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian nuclear zinc finger protein Np95 and Np95/ICBP90-like ring finger
   protein (NIRF),  ubiquitin  ligases  involved  in cell cycle regulation and
   genome stability.
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana  histone-lysine  N-methyltransferases,  H3  lysine-9
   specific (EC 2.1.1.43), homologs of suppressor of variegation 3-9.
 - Nicotiana  tabacum  SET-domain-containing  protein (nSET1), involved in the
   control of plant growth.
 - Deinococcus radiodurans hypothetical protein DR1533.
 - Streptomyces coelicolor hypothetical protein SCO5333.

The profile we developed covers the entire YDG domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
