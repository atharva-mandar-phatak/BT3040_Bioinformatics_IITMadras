* 14-3-3 proteins signatures *
******************************

The 14-3-3 proteins [1,2,3] are a family of closely related acidic homodimeric
proteins of  about 30 Kd which were first identified as being very abundant in
mammalian brain tissues  and located  preferentially  in neurons.   The 14-3-3
proteins seem  to  have  multiple biological activities and play a key role in
signal transduction  pathways  and the cell cycle. They interacts with kinases
such as  PKC or Raf-1; they seem to also  function as protein-kinase dependent
activators of  tyrosine  and  tryptophan  hydroxylases  and in plants they are
associated with a complex that binds to the G-box promoter elements.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins are ubiquitously found in all eukaryotic species
studied and have been sequenced in fungi  (yeast BMH1 and BMH2,  fission yeast
rad24 and rad25), plants, Drosophila, and vertebrates. The  sequences  of  the
14-3-3 proteins  are  extremely  well conserved. As signature patterns we have
selected two  highly  conserved regions: the first is a peptide of 11 residues
located in  the N-terminal section; the second, a 20 amino acid region located
in the C-terminal section.
