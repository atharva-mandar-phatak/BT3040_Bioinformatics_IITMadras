* UvrD-like DNA helicase domain profiles *
******************************************

Helicases  have  been  classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5) [1]. All of the
proteins  bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A
(phosphate-binding   loop   or   P-loop)   (see   <PDOC00017>)  and  Walker  B
(Mg2+-binding  aspartic acid) motifs [1]. For the two largest groups, commonly
referred  to  as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs have been
identified   [2]  which  are  distributed  over  two  structural  domains,  an
N-terminal ATP-binding domain and a C-terminal domain. UvrD-like DNA helicases
belong  to  SF1, but they differ from classical SF1/SF2 (see <PDOC51192>) by a
large  insertion  in  each  domain.  UvrD-like DNA helicases unwind DNA with a
3'-5' polarity [3].

Crystal  structures  of  several uvrD-like DNA helicases have been solved (see
for  example <PDB:1UAA>) [4,5,6]. They are monomeric enzymes consisting of two
domains  with  a  common  alpha-beta  RecA-like  core. The ATP-binding site is
situated  in  a cleft between the N-terminus of the ATP-binding domain and the
beginning  of  the C-terminal domain. The enzyme crystallizes in two different
conformations (open and closed). The conformational difference between the two
forms  comprises  a  large  rotation  of  the  end of the C-terminal domain by
approximately  130°.  This  "domain swiveling" was proposed to be an important
aspect of the mechanism of the enzyme [5].

Some  proteins  that  belong  to  the uvrD-like DNA helicase family are listed
below:

 - Bacterial  UvrD  helicase.  It  is  involved in the post-incision events of
   nucleotide  excision repair and methyl-directed mismatch repair. It unwinds
   DNA  duplexes  with  3'-5'  polarity  with  respect to the bound strand and
   initiates  unwinding  most  effectively  when  a  single-stranded region is
   present.
 - Gram-positive  bacterial pcrA helicase, an essential enzyme involved in DNA
   repair  and  rolling  circle  replication.  The  Staphylococcus aureus pcrA
   helicase has both 5'-3' and 3'-5' helicase activities.
 - Bacterial  rep proteins, a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase involved in
   DNA replication which can initiate unwinding at a nick in the DNA. It binds
   to  the single-stranded DNA and acts in a progressive fashion along the DNA
   in the 3' to 5' direction.
 - Bacterial  helicase  IV  (helD gene product). It catalyzes the unwinding of
   duplex DNA in the 3'-5' direction.
 - Bacterial  recB  protein.  RecBCD is a multi-functional enzyme complex that
   processes DNA ends resulting from a double-strand break. RecB is a helicase
   with a 3'-5' directionality.
 - Fungal  srs2 proteins, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase involved in DNA repair.
   The polarity of the helicase activity was determined to be 3'-5'.

To recognize uvrD-like DNA helicases we have developed two profiles. The first
one  recognizes  the  ATP-binding  domain,  whereas the second one is directed
against the C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
