************************************
* Ribonuclease II family signature *
************************************

On the basis of sequence similarities, the following bacterial  and eukaryotic
proteins seem to form a family:

 - Escherichia coli and  related bacteria ribonuclease II (EC 3.1.13.1) (RNase
   II) (gene  rnb)  [1]. RNase II is an exonuclease involved in mRNA decay. It
   degrades mRNA    by    hydrolyzing    single-stranded   polyribonucleotides
   processively in the 3' to 5' direction.
 - Bacterial ribnuclease R [2], a 3'-5'exoribonuclease that participates in an
   essential cell function.
 - Yeast protein SSD1 (or SRK1) which is implicated in the control of the cell
   cycle G1 phase.
 - Yeast  protein  DIS3  [3],  which  binds  to ran (GSP1) and ehances the the
   nucleotide-releasing activity of RCC1 on ran.
 - Fission yeast protein dis3, which is implicated in mitotic control.
 - Neurospora crassa cyt-4, a mitochondrial protein required for RNA 5' and 3'
   end processing and splicing.
 - Yeast protein MSU1, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.
 - Synechocystis  strain PCC 6803 protein zam [4], which control resistance to
   the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F48E8.6.

The size of these proteins range from 644 residues (rnb) to 1250 (SSD1). While
their sequence is highly divergent they share a  conserved  domain in their C-
terminal section  [5].  It  is  possible  that  this  domain plays a role in a
putative exonuclease  function  that would be common to all these proteins. We
have developed a signature pattern based on the core of this conserved domain.

-Consensus pattern: [HI]-[FYE]-[GSTAM]-[LIVM]-x(4,5)-Y-[STALV]-x-[FWVAC]-[TV]-
                    [SA]-P-[LIVMA]-[RQ]-[KR]-[FY]-x-D-x(3)-[HQ]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
