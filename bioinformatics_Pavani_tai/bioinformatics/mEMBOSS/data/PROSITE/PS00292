* Cyclins signature *
*********************

Cyclins [1,2,3]  are  eukaryotic   proteins  which  play  an  active  role  in
controlling  nuclear  cell  division cycles.  Cyclins, together  with  the p34
(cdc2)  or cdk2 kinases, form the Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). There are
two main groups of cyclins:

 - G2/M  cyclins,  essential  for  the  control of the  cell cycle at the G2/M
   (mitosis) transition.   G2/M cyclins  accumulate steadily during G2 and are
   abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase).
 - G1/S  cyclins,  essential  for  the   control of the cell cycle at the G1/S
   (start) transition.

In most species, there are multiple  forms of  G1 and G2 cyclins. For example,
in vertebrates,  there  are  two G2 cyclins, A and B,  and  at least  three G1
cyclins, C, D, and E.

A cyclin homolog has also been found in herpesvirus saimiri [4].

The best conserved region is in the central  part  of  the cyclins' sequences,
known as the 'cyclin-box', from which we have derived a 32 residue pattern.

-Consensus pattern: R-x(2)-[LIVMSA]-x(2)-[FYWS]-[LIVM]-x(8)-[LIVMFC]-x(4)-
                    [LIVMFYA]-x(2)-[STAGC]-[LIVMFYQ]-x-[LIVMFYC]-[LIVMFY]-D-
                    [RKH]-[LIVMFYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for G1/S  cyclins  C  from  human and Drosophila, puc1 and mcs2 from  fission
 yeast and CLG1, PCL1 (HCS26) and PCL2 (CLN4) from budding yeast.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1995 / Pattern and text revised.
