* Histidinol dehydrogenase signature *
**************************************

Histidinol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.23) (HDH) catalyzes  the  terminal  step in
the  biosynthesis of  histidine  in  bacteria,  fungi,  and  plants, the four-
electron oxidation of L-histidinol to histidine.

In bacteria HDH is a single chain  polypeptide;  in fungi it is the C-terminal
domain of a multifunctional  enzyme which  catalyzes three  different steps of
histidine biosynthesis;  and  in  plants it is  expressed as  nuclear  encoded
protein precursor which is exported to the chloroplast [1].

As a  signature  pattern  we selected a highly conserved region located in the
central part of HDH. This region does not correspond to the part of the enzyme
that, in most, but not all HDH sequences contains a cysteine residue which, in
Salmonella typhimurium, has  been  said  [2] to be important for the catalytic
activity of the enzyme.
