* KaiC domain profile *
***********************

The  kaiC  domain  is  a  ~240  residue domain of the cyanobacterial circadian
(daily)  clock  protein  kaiC  and related prokaryotic proteins. The domain is
named after Synechococcus sp. kaiC, a regulator of the kai genes and circadian
oscillations  in  cyanobacteria  ('kai'  means  cycle  in  Japanese). The kaiC
protein  is  composed  of  two kaiC domains. Besides the typical double-domain
kaiC,   several   single-kaiC-domain  proteins  occur,  also  in  archaea  and
proteobacteria,   and  whereof  only  certain  subfamilies  perform  circadian
functions  [1,2].  The domain has a recA/dnaB-like sequence and structure (see
<PDOC00131>). The kaiC domain includes an ATP/GTP-binding Walker A and B motif
(see  <PDOC00017>)  and a conserved Glu with potential catalytic function. The
phosphorylation  of  kaiC  is  essential  for  the  rhythmic  pattern  of gene
expression [3-5].

The  crystal  structure  of the cyanobacterial kaiC homohexamer shows that the
two  kaiC  domains  fold  similarly (see <PDB:1U9I>), but differences occur in
their ATP binding pockets [4].

Some proteins known to contain a kaiC domain:

 - Cyanobacterial  kaiC,  a  principal circadian clock protein, present in the
   kaiABC  complex.  It represses the expression of the kaiBC operon and other
   global genes.
 - Archaeal UPF0273 protein, a hypothetical protein with a single kaiC domain.

The  profile we developed covers the entire kaiC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
