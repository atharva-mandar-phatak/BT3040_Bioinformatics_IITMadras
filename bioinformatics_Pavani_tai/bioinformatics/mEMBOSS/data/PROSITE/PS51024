********************************
* Zinc finger FCS-type profile *
********************************

The FCS-type zinc finger, after the signature FCS residues associated with the
third  cysteine,  is  present in several polycomb group proteins. The FCS zinc
finger is expected to adopt a Zn-ribbon like fold. Molecular data suggest that
this domain can bind RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner [1].

Proteins known to contain an FCS-type zinc finger are listed below:

 - Drosphila  polyhomeotic  (ph)  protein  and vertebrate homologues. They are
   members  of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), an inhibitory complex
   that acts by preventing chromatin remodeling and transcription.
 - Drosophila  Sex  comb  on  midleg (Scm) and vertebrate homologues. They are
   also members of the PRC1.
 - Drosphila  Lethal(3) malignant brain tumor (l(3)mbt) protein and vertebrate
   homologues.

The profile we developed covers the entire FCS-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
