* DNA polymerase family A signature *
*************************************

Replicative  DNA polymerases (EC 2.7.7.7)  are the key enzymes  catalyzing the
accurate  replication of DNA.   They require either a small RNA molecule or  a
protein as a primer for the de novo synthesis of a DNA chain.  On the basis of
sequence similarities  a number of DNA polymerases have  been grouped together
[1,2,3] under the designation of DNA polymerase family A. The polymerases that
belong to this family are listed below.

 - Escherichia coli and various other bacterial polymerase I (gene polA).
 - Thermus aquaticus Taq polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage sp01 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage sp02 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage T5 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage T7 polymerase.
 - Mycobacteriophage L5 polymerase.
 - Yeast mitochondrial polymerase gamma (gene MIP1).

Five regions of similarity  are  found  in  all the above polymerases.  One of
these conserved regions, known as 'motif B' [1], is located in a domain which,
in Escherichia coli polA,  has been shown to bind deoxynucleotide triphosphate
substrates; it contains a conserved tyrosine  which  has been shown, by photo-
affinity labelling, to be in the active site; a conserved lysine, also part of
this motif, can be chemically labelled, using pyridoxal phosphate. We use this
conserved region as a signature for this family of DNA polymerases.
