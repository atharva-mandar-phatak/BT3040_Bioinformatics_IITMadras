* Kinase associated domain 1 (KA1) profile *
********************************************

Members  of  the  KIN2/PAR-1/MARK kinase subfamily are conserved from yeast to
human  and share the same domain organisation: an N-terminal kinase domain and
a   C-terminal   kinase  associated  domain  1  (KA1).  Some  members  of  the
KIN1/PAR-1/MARK  family  also contain an UBA domain (see <PDOC50030>). Members
of  this kinase subfamily are involved in various biological processes such as
cell  polarity,  cell  cycle  control,  intracellular  signaling,  microtubule
stability and protein stability [1]. The function of the KA1 domain is not yet
known.

Some proteins known to contain a KA1 domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  MAP/microtubule  affinity-regulating  kinases (MARK 1,2,3). They
   regulate   polarity   in  neuronal  cell  models  and  appear  to  function
   redundantly  in phosphorylating MT-associated proteins and in regulating MT
   stability [2].
 - Mammalian   maternal   embryonic   leucine   zipper   kinase   (MELK).   It
   phosphorylates ZNF622 and may contribute to its redirection to the nucleus.
   It  may  be  involved  in  the  inhibition  of  spliceosome assembly during
   mitosis.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  and  drosophila  PAR-1 protein. It is required for
   establishing  polarity  in  embryos  where it is assimetrically distributed
   [3].
 - Fungal  Kin1 and Kin2 protein kinases involved in regulation of exocytosis.
   They localize to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane [4].
 - Plant KIN10 and KIN11 proteins, catalytic subunits of the putative trimeric
   SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) complex.

The profile we developed covers the entire KA1 domain

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
