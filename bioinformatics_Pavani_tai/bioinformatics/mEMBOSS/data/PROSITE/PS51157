* Zinc finger UBR-type profile *
********************************

It  has been observed that the identity of N-terminal residues of a protein is
related  to  the  half  life  of  the protein. This observation yields a rule,
called  the  N-end  rule  [1]. Similar but distinct versions of the N-end rule
operate  in  all  organisms  examined,  from mammals to fungi and bacteria. In
eukaryotes,  the  N-end  rule  pathway  is a part of the ubiquitin degradation
system.  Some  proteins  that  have  a very short half life contain a specific
motif  at  their  N-terminus,  the  N-degron.  It  consists of a destabilizing
N-terminal  residue  and  an  internal Lys, which is the site of poly-Ub chain
[1,2].

The UBR1 protein was shown to bind specifically to proteins bearing N-terminal
residues  that  are  destabilizing  according  to  the  N-end rule, but not to
otherwise identical proteins bearing stabilizing N-terminal residues [3]. UBR1
contain  an  N-terminal  conserved  region (the UBR-type zinc finger) which is
also  found  in  various  proteins  implicated  in  N-degron  recognition. The
UBR-type  zinc finger defines a unique E3 class, most likely N-degron specific
[4].

The profile we developed covers the whole UBR-type zinc finger.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The UBR-type zinc finger is also known as the UBR box motif [4].
