***********************
* SANT domain profile *
***********************

The  myb  family can be classified into three groups: the myb-type HTH domain,
which binds DNA (see <PDOC00037>), the SANT domain, which is a protein-protein
interaction  module  and the myb-like domain that can be involved in either of
these functions.

The  SANT domain is a motif of ~50 amino acids present in proteins involved in
chromatin-remodelling and transcription regulation. This eukaryotic domain was
identified    in    nuclear    receptor    co-repressors   and   named   after
switching-defective  protein  3  (Swi3),  adaptor  2  (Ada2), nuclear receptor
co-repressor  (N-CoR)  and  transcription  factor  (TF)IIIB [1]. Although SANT
domains  show remarkable sequence and structural similarity to the DNA-binding
helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of the myb-like tandem repeat (see <PDOC00037>),
their  function  is not DNA binding. Instead, SANT domains are protein-protein
interaction  modules  and  some  can  bind  to histone tails (e.g. in Ada2 and
SMRT).  SANT  domains are found in combination with other domains, such as the
SWIRM domain (see <PDOC50934>), the ZZ-type zinc finger (see <PDOC50135>), the
C2H2-type  zinc  finger  (see  <PDOC00028>),  the  GATA-type  zinc finger (see
<PDOC00300>),  the  MPN-domain  (see <QDOC50249>) and DEAH ATP-helicase domain
(see   <PDOC00039>).   The   SANT   domain  was  proposed  to  function  as  a
histone-interaction   module  that  couples  histone-tail  binding  to  enzyme
catalysis for the remodelling of nucleosomes [2,3].

The  3-dimensional structure of the SANT domain forms three alpha helices (see
<PDB:1OFC>) [2] similar to the DNA-binding myb-type HTH domain. Because of the
strong  resemblance,  the  SANT  domain  can  also  be  detected as a myb-like
"DNA-binding"  domain  (see  <PDOC00037>). Most SANT domains have acidic amino
acids  at  the  start  of  helix  2 and in helix 3, while myb-like DNA-binding
domains  have  more  positively charged residues, in particular in their third
'recognition' helix. The bulky aromatic and hydrophobic residues in the center
of  helix  3  that  are incompatible with DNA contacts of myb-like DNA-binding
domains form another distinguishing property of SANT domains.

Some proteins known to contain a SANT domain:

 - Baker's  yeast  ada2,  the  transcriptional adaptor 2 protein, a subunit of
   many  Gcn5  (general  control of amino-acid synthesis protein 5)-containing
   histone-acetyltransferase   complexes   of   histone   modifying   enzymes.
   Eukaryotic  ada2-like  proteins  are  associated with chromatin and mediate
   protein-protein interactions.
 - Baker's  yeast rsc8 protein of the RSC (remodel the structure of chromatin)
   complex of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzymes.
 - Human   N-CoR   and  SMRT  (silencing  mediator  of  retinoid  and  thyroid
   receptors),   both   are  subunits  of  histone  deacetylase  complexes  of
   histone-modifying  enzymes.  Both  proteins  contain a pair of SANT domains
   spaced by ~130 aa.
 - Baker's  yeast  Swi3,  a  transcription  regulatory  protein of the SWI/SNF
   (switching-defective/sucrose   non-fermenting)   complex  of  ATP-dependent
   chromatin-remodelling enzymes.
 - Fruit  fly  ISWI,  imitation  switch  protein,  an  ATP-dependent chromatin
   remodelling  enzyme  conserved from yeast to human. In addition to the SANT
   domain, it contains a SLIDE (SANT-like ISWI) domain that can bind DNA [2].
 - Human   SMARCC1,   SWI/SNF  related,  matrix  associated,  actin  dependent
   regulator of chromatin, subfamily c protein.
 - Mammalian MTA1 and MTA2, metastasis-associated proteins 1 and 2, components
   of  distinct  complexes  with histone deacetylase activity and both repress
   transcription specifically [4].

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the  entire  SANT  domain.  SANT-specific
positions within the profile have been manually adapted.

-Sequences  known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL, except
 2.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note:  The  SANT  domain  profile  is in competition with profiles of related
 domains,  which  include  the  myb-type  HTH  DNA-binding domain and myb-like
 domain (see <PDOC00037>).
