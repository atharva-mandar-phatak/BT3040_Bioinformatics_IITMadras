* TTL domain profile *
**********************

Tubulin  tyrosine  ligase  (TTL)  (EC  6.3.2.25)  is an enzyme involved in the
posttranslational   modification   of   tubulin.  Assembled  microtubules  are
detyrosinated over time at the C-terminus of alpha-tubulin. After microtubular
disassembly  TTL  restores tyrosine residues back to the detyrosinated tubulin
leading  to  a  cycle  of  detyrosination/tyrosination. TTL may play a role in
tumor cell regulation.

The  TTL  domain is a ~350 amino acid module present in a family of eukaryotic
proteins  that  could catalyze ligations of diverse amino acids to tubulins or
other  substrates.  The  domain is named after mammalian TTL. Tubulin tyrosine
ligase-like  (TTLL)  proteins include tubulin polyglutamylases, which catalyze
the  posttranslational  addition  of  multiple  glutamic  acids to a glutamate
residue  of  target  proteins, such as tubulin or nucleosome assembly proteins
NAP1  and  NAP2. Tubulin polyglutamylation may be involved in the organization
of  the neuronal microtubule network, in centriole stability, axoneme motility
and   mitosis   [1].  The  TTL  domain  contains  ATP-grasp-like  motifs  (see
<PDOC50975>) that correspond to the ATP/Mg(2+) binding site typical of enzymes
with ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine/thiol ligase activity [2].

Some proteins known to contain a TTL domain:

 - Mammalian tubulin--tyrosine ligase (TTL) (EC 6.3.2.25), which catalyzes the
   posttranslational   addition  of  a  tyrosine  residue  to  the  C-terminal
   glutamate of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin subunits in microtubules.
 - Mammalian  tubulin--tyrosine  ligase-like  protein  1  (TTLL1),  a  tubulin
   polyglutamylase with preference for the alpha-tubulin subunit.
 - Tetrahymena  TTLL6A,  a  tubulin  polyglutamylase  with  preference for the
   beta-tubulin subunit [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire TTL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
