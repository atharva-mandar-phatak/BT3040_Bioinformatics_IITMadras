* FXYD family signature *
*************************

A family  of  vertebrate small membrane proteins is collectively known as FXYD
in recognition of invariant amino acids in its signature motif. These proteins
are involved  in  the  control  of  ion transport and consist of the following
members [1,2]:

 - Phospholemman (gene FXYD1).
 - Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase gamma chain (gene FXYD2).
 - Chloride conductance inducer protein mat-8 (gene FXYD3).
 - Channel inducing factor (CHIF) (gene FXYD4).
 - FXYD5 (RIC; OIT2).
 - FXYD6
 - FXYD7
 - FXYD8

Except for  FXYD5, all these proteins are very small and their size range from
58 residues for FXYD2 to 95 for FXYD6. FXYD5 is longer (178 residues) due to a
N-terminal extension. They all contain a single transmembrane domain. With the
exception of  FXYD2,  they  all seem to have a N-terminal signal peptide. As a
signature pattern,  we  selected  a conserved region that start a few residues
before the  beginning  of the transmembrane domain and that stop four residues
inside that region.

-Consensus pattern: [DNSE]-x-F-x-Y-[DN]-x(2)-[STNR]-[LIVM]-[RQ]-x(2)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
