* Shiga/ricin ribosomal inactivating toxins active site signature *
*******************************************************************

A number of bacterial and plant toxins act by  inhibiting protein synthesis in
eukaryotic cells.  The toxins  of  the Shiga  and ricin  family inactivate 60S
ribosomal  subunits  by an N-glycosidic  cleavage  which  releases a  specific
adenine base from the sugar-phosphate backbone of 28S rRNA [1,2,3]. The toxins
which are known to function in this manner are:

 - Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae [4].  This toxin is  composed  of one
   copy of  an  enzymatically  active A subunit and five copies of a B subunit
   responsible  for  binding the    toxin complex to specific receptors on the
   target cell surface.
 - Shiga-like  toxins  (SLT)  are    a group  of Escherichia  coli toxins very
   similar in  their  structure and properties to Shiga toxin. The sequence of
   two types of these toxins, SLT-1 [5] and SLT-2 [6], is known.
 - Ricin, a  potent toxin  from castor bean  seeds.   Ricin  consists  of  two
   glycosylated  chains  linked   by   a  disulfide  bond.   The  A  chain  is
   enzymatically active. The B chain is a lectin with a binding preference for
   galactosides. Both chains  are  encoded by a single polypeptidic precursor.
   Ricin is classified as a type-II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP); other
   members of this family  are agglutinin, also  from  castor  bean, and abrin
   from the seeds of the bean Abrus precatorius [7].
 - Single  chain  ribosome-inactivating   proteins (type-I RIP)  from  plants.
   Examples of such proteins are:  barley  protein  synthesis inhibitors I and
   II, mongolian  snake-gourd  trichosanthin,  sponge  gourd  luffin-A and -B,
   garden four-o'clock MAP, common pokeberry PAP-S and soapwort saporin-6 [7].

All these toxins are  structurally related.  A conserved  glutamic residue has
been implicated [8] in the catalytic mechanism; it is located near a conserved
arginine which also plays a role in catalysis [9].  The signature we developed
for these proteins includes these catalytic residues.
