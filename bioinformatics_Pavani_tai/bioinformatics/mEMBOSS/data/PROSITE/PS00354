*************************************************

High mobility group (HMG) proteins  are a  family of  relatively low molecular
weight non-histone components in chromatin.  HMG-I  and HMG-Y  are proteins of
about 100 amino acid  residues which  are produced by the alternative splicing
of a  single gene  (HMG-Y  differs  from  HMG-I by the internal deletion of 11
amino acids).  HMG-I/Y bind  preferentially  to  the  minor groove of A+T-rich
regions in double-stranded DNA.   It  is suggested  that these  proteins could
function  in  nucleosome   phasing  and  in   the 3' end  processing  of  mRNA
transcripts.  They are also involved in  the transcription regulation of genes
containing, or in close proximity to, A+T-rich regions.

DNA-binding of these  proteins is effected by a 11 residues domain, called the
A+T-hook [1], this domain is repeated three times in the sequence of HMG-I/Y.
