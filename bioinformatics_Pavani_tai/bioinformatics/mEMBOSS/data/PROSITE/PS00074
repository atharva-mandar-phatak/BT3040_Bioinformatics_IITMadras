 - Glutamate  dehydrogenases  (EC 1.4.1.2, EC 1.4.1.3, and EC 1.4.1.4) (GluDH)
   are enzymes that catalyze the NAD- or NADP-dependent reversible deamination
   of glutamate into  alpha-ketoglutarate [1,2]. GluDH isozymes are  generally
   involved with either ammonia assimilation or glutamate catabolism.
 - Leucine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.9) (LeuDH) is a  NAD-dependent enzyme  that
   catalyzes the reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic
   amino acids to their keto analogues [3].
 - Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.20) (PheDH) is a NAD-dependent enzyme
   that catalyzes the  reversible deamidation of  L-phenylalanine into phenyl-
   pyruvate [4].
 - Valine  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.4.1.8) (ValDH) is a NADP-dependent enzyme that
   catalyzes the  reversible   deamidation   of   L-valine   into  3-methyl-2-
   oxobutanoate [5].

These  dehydrogenases  are structurally and functionally related.  A conserved
lysine  residue located in a  glycine-rich  region has been  implicated in the
catalytic mechanism. The conservation of the region around this residue allows
the derivation of a signature pattern for such type of enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-x(2)-G-G-[SAG]-K-x-[GV]-x(3)-[DNST]-[PL]
                    [K is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: All known sequences from this family have Pro in the  last  position of
 the pattern with the exception of yeast GluDH which as Leu.

-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
