* DWNN domain profile *
***********************

The ~75-residue  DWNN (Domain With No Name) domain is highly conserved through
eukaryotic species but is absent in prokaryotes. The DWNN domain is found only
at the N-terminus of the RBBP6 family of proteins which includes:

 - Mammalian  RBBP6,  a  splicing-associated  protein that plays a role in the
   induction of apoptosis and regulation of the cell cycle.
 - Drosophila  SNAMA (something that sticks like glue), a protein that appears
   to play a role in apoptosis.

All of  the  identified  RBBP6 homologues include the DWNN domain, a CCHC-type
zinc finger  (see  <PDOC50158>) and a RING-type zinc finger (see <PDOC00449>).
The three  domain  form is found in plants, protozoa, fungi and microsporidia.
The RBBP6  homologues in vertebrates, insects and worms are longer and include
additional domains.  In  addition  to  forming  part  of the full-length RBBP6
protein, the  DWNN  domain is also expressed in vertebrates as a small protein
containing a  DWNN  domain  and a short C-terminal tail (RBBP6 variant 3). The
DWNN domain  adopts  a fold similar to the ubiquitin one, characterized by two
alpha-helices and  four beta-sheets ordered as beta-beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta
along the  sequence  (see  <PDB:2C7H>).  The  similarity  of  DWNN  domain  to
ubiquitin and the presence of the RING finger suggest that the DWNN domain may
act as  an  ubiquitin-like modifier, possibly playing a role in the regulation
of the splicing machinery [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire DWNN domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
