* LuxR-type HTH domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  luxR-type  HTH  domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of
about  65  amino  acids,  present in transcription regulators of the LuxR/FixJ
family of response regulators. The domain is named after Vibrio fischeri luxR,
a  transcriptional  activator  for  quorum-sensing  control  of  luminescence.
LuxR-type  HTH domain proteins occur in bacteria and in chloroplasts of algae.
The  DNA-binding  HTH  domain  is  usually located in the C-terminal part; the
N-terminal  part  can  contain  an  autoinducer  binding  domain or a response
regulatory   domain  (see  <PDOC50110>).  Most  luxR-type  regulators  act  as
transcription  activators,  but some can be repressors or have a dual role for
different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities
in various biological processes.

Several  structures of luxR-type HTH proteins have been resolved and show that
the  DNA-binding domain is formed by a four-helix bundle (see <PDB:1P4W>). The
helix-turn-helix motif comprises the second and third helices, which are being
called  the  scaffold  and  the  recognition  helix,  respectively. The HTH is
involved  in  DNA-binding  into the major groove, where the N-terminal part of
the recognition helix makes most DNA-contacts. The fourth helix is involved in
dimerization of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation
mechanisms  described  below  lead  to  multimerization  of the regulator. The
regulators bind DNA as multimers [1-4].

LuxR-type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms:

I.  Regulators  which  belong  to  a two-component sensory transduction system
where  the  protein  is  activated  by  its  phosphorylation,  generally on an
aspartate  residue,  by  a  transmembrane kinase. Some proteins that belong to
this category are:

 - Rhizobiaceae   fixJ,   a   global  regulator  inducing  the  expression  of
   nitrogen-fixation genes in microaerobiosis.
 - Escherichia  coli  and Salmonella typhimurium uhpA, activates the uhpT gene
   for hexose phosphate transport.
 - Escherichia coli narL and narP, activate the nitrate reductase operon.
 - Escherichia  coli  evgA,  modulates the expression of several drug exporter
   genes.
 - Enterobacteria  rcsB,  involved  in  the  regulation  of  exopolysaccharide
   biosynthesis in enteric and plant pathogenesis.
 - Bordetella pertussis bvgA, plays a role in virulence.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  comA, plays a role in the expression of late-expressing
   competence genes.
 - Rhodobacter  capsulatus  dctR,  controls the expression of C4-dicarboxylate
   transport genes.
 - Bacillus subtilis degU, activates extracellular proteases genes.
 - Escherichia  coli  and  Salmonella typhimurium fimZ, indirectly involved in
   antibiotic resistance and expression of type 1 fimbriae.
 - Pseudomonas  fluorescens  gacA,  involved  in  the  regulation of secondary
   metabolism.
 - Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  glpR,  activates  genes  of the glycerol metabolic
   pathway.
 - Rhizobiaceae  nodW,  probably regulates the transcription of genes involved
   in the nodulation process.

II. Regulators which are activated when bound to autoinducer molecules such as
N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine  lactone  (OHHL) (see <PDOC00731>), a mechanism
which  can be involved in quorum sensing systems. Some proteins that belong to
this category are:

 - Vibrio fischeri luxR, activates the bioluminescence operon.
 - Agrobacterium  tumefaciens  traR,  involved in the regulation of Ti plasmid
   transfer.
 - Erwinia carotovora carR, plays a role in the control of the biosynthesis of
   carbapenem antibiotics.
 - Erwinia  carotovora  expR, acts in virulence (soft rot disease) through the
   activation of genes for plant tissue macerating enzymes.
 - Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasR, activates the elastase gene (lasB).
 - Erwinia chrysanthemi echR and Erwinia stewartii esaR.
 - Pseudomonas aureofaciens phzR, a positive regulator of phenazine antibiotic
   production.
 - Pseudomonas aeruginosa rhlR, activates the rhlAB operon as well as the lasB
   gene.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica yenR.

III.  Autonomous  effector  domain  regulators,  without  a regulatory domain,
represented by gerE [2].

 - Bacillus  subtilis  gerE,  a  transcription activator and repressor for the
   regulation of spore formation.

IV. Multiple ligands binding regulators, exemplified by malT.

 - Escherichia  coli  malT,  activates  the maltose operon. MalT binds ATP and
   maltotriose.

The  'helix-turn-helix'  DNA-binding motif of these proteins is located in the
C-terminal  section  of  the  sequence.  The  pattern  we  use to detect these
proteins  starts  three residues downstream of the N-terminal extremity of the
helix-turn-helix  motif  and  extends one residue downstream of its C-terminal
extremity.  We  also  developed a profile that covers the entire luxR-type HTH
DNA-binding  domain,  including  helices  1  and  4,  and  which allows a more
sensitive detection.
