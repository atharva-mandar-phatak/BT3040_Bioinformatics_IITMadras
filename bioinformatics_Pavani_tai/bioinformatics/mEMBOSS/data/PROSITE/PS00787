* Chorismate synthase signatures *
**********************************

Chorismate synthase (EC 4.2.3.5) catalyzes  the last of the seven steps in the
shikimate pathway  which  is  used  in  prokaryotes, fungi and  plants for the
biosynthesis of  aromatic  amino acids. It catalyzes the 1,4-trans elimination
of the  phosphate group from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to form
chorismate which  can  then  be  used in phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan
biosynthesis. Chorismate  synthase  requires  the presence of a reduced flavin
mononucleotide (FMNH2 or FADH2) for its activity.

Chorismate synthase from various sources shows [1,2] a high degree of sequence
conservation. It  is  a  protein  of  about 360 to 400 amino-acid residues. We
developed three  signature  patterns  from  conserved  regions  rich  in basic
residues (mostly  arginines).  The  first  is  in  the N-terminal section, the
second is central and the third is C-terminal.
