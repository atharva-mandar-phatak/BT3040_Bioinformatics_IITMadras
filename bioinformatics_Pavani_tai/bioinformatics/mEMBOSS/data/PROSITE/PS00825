* Elongation factor 1 beta/beta'/delta chain signatures *
*********************************************************

Eukaryotic elongation  factor 1 (EF-1) is  responsible  for  the GTP-dependent
binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs  to  the ribosomes [1].  EF-1  is  composed of four
subunits:  the alpha chain which  binds GTP  and  aminoacyl-tRNAs,   the gamma
chain that probably plays  a  role in anchoring the complex to other  cellular
components and the beta and delta (or beta') chains. The beta and delta chains
are highly similar proteins that  both  stimulate the exchange of GDP bound to
the alpha chain for GTP [2].   The  beta  and  delta  chains  are  hydrophilic
proteins of around 23 to 31 Kd. Their C-terminal part seems  important for the
nucleotide  exchange  activity,   while  the  N-terminal section  is  probably
involved in the interaction with the gamma chain.

We have developed two signature patterns  for  this  family  of  proteins. The
first corresponds  to  an acidic region in the central section; the second, to
the C-terminal extremity of these proteins.
