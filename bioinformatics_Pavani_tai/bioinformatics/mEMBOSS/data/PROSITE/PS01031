* Heat shock hsp20 proteins family profile *
********************************************

Prokaryotic   and  eukaryotic  organisms   respond  to  heat  shock  or  other
environmental stress  by inducing the synthesis of proteins collectively known
as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1]. Amongst them is a family of proteins with an
average molecular weight of 20 Kd, known as the hsp20 proteins [2 to 5]. These
seem to act as chaperones that can protect other proteins against heat-induced
denaturation and    aggregation.   Hsp20   proteins   seem   to   form   large
heterooligomeric aggregates;   their  family  is  currently  composed  of  the
following members:

 - Vertebrate  heat  shock  protein  hsp27  (hsp25),  induced  by a variety of
   environmental stresses.
 - Drosophila heat shock proteins hsp22, hsp23, hsp26, hsp27, hsp67BA and BC.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hsp16 multigene family.
 - Fungal  HSP26  (budding yeast) and hsp30 (Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus
   Nidulans).
 - Plant  small  hsp's.  Plants  have  four classes of hsp20: classes I and II
   which are  cytoplasmic, class III which is chloroplastic and class IV which
   is found in the endomembrane.
 - Alpha-crystallin   A   and   B  chains.  Alpha-crystallin  is  an  abundant
   constituent of the eye lens of most vertebrate species.  Its  main function
   appears to be to  maintain the correct refractive index of the lens.  It is
   also found in other tissues where it seems to act as a chaperone [6].
 - Schistosoma  mansoni  major  egg antigen p40. Structurally, p40 is built of
   two tandem hsp20 domains.
 - A  variety  of  prokaryotic proteins: ibpA and ibpB from  Escherichia coli,
   hsp18 from  Clostridium  acetobutylicum,  spore  protein  SP21  (hspA) from
   Stigmatella aurantiaca,    Mycobacterium   leprae   18   Kd   antigen   and
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis 14 Kd antigen.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0285.

Structurally, this family is characterized  by  the presence of a conserved C-
terminal domain of about 100 residues. The profile developed to detect members
of the hsp20 family is based on an alignment of this domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
