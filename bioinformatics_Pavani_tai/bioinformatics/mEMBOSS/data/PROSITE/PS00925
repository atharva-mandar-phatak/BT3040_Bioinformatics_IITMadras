* Pollen proteins Ole e I family signature *
********************************************

The following  plant  pollen  proteins,  whose  biological function is not yet
known, are structurally related [1]:

 - Olive tree pollen major allergen (Ole e I).
 - Tomato anther-specific protein LAT52.
 - Maize pollen-specific protein ZmC13.

These proteins are most probably secreted and  consist  of about 145 residues.
As shown  in the  following  schematic representation, there are six cysteines
which are  conserved  in  the  sequence  of  these  proteins.  They seem to be
involved in disulfide bonds.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [EQT]-G-x-V-Y-C-D-[TNP]-C-R
                    [The 2 C's may be involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
