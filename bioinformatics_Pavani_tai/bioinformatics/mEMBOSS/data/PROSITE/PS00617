* recF protein signatures *
***************************

The prokaryotic protein recF [1,2]  is a  single-stranded DNA-binding  protein
which also probably binds  ATP.  RecF  is  involved in DNA  metabolism;  it is
required for recombinational DNA repair and for induction of the SOS response.

RecF is a protein of  about  350  to  370  amino  acid  residues;  there  is a
conserved ATP-binding site motif 'A' (P-loop) in the N-terminal section of the
protein as well as two  other  conserved regions,  one  located in the central
section, and the other in the C-terminal section.  We  have  derived signature
patterns from these two regions.

-Consensus pattern: [LIFV]-x(6)-[LIF]-[LIVF]-x-[GSDE]-[GSTADNPE]-[PASG]-x(2)-
                    R-R-x-[FYW]-[LIVMF]-[DN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-[LIFYMV]-x-[LIVM]-D-[DEA]-[LIVF]-x(2)-[EHCGK]-L-D-
                    x(2)-[KRH]-x(3)-[LIVF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
