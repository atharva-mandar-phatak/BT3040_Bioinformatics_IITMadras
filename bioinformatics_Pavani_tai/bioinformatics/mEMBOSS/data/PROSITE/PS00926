* Lysyl oxidase putative copper-binding region signature *
**********************************************************

Lysyl oxidase   (EC 1.4.3.13) (LOX) [1] is  an  extracellular copper-dependent
enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in
precursors of various collagens and elastins.  The deaminated lysines are then
able to form aldehyde cross-links.

In vertebrates  LOX  belongs to a family [2] that also includes three LOX-like
proteins (genes  LOXL1,  LOXL2  and  LOXL3) whose function is not yet known. A
LOX-type catalytic  domain  is found in all three LOX-like proteins. LOXL2 and
LOXL3 also contains 4 SRCR domains (see <PDOC00348>).

LOX binds  a  single  copper  atom  which seems to reside within an octahedral
coordination complex  which  includes  at  least three histidine ligands. Four
histidine residues  are  clustered  in  a  central  region of the enzyme. This
region is  thought to be involved in cooper-binding and is called the 'copper-
talon' [1]. We have used this region as a signature pattern.
