* Plant C6 type antimicrobial peptide (AMP) signature *
*******************************************************

Plants normally  grow on substrates that are extremely rich in microorganisms,
but infection  remains a rare event. During evolution, plants have developed a
variety of  defense  systems  to  protect themselves from potential pathogens.
Proteins including thionins, plant defensins and chitinases have been shown to
play active  roles against pathogen infections. Plants produce a wide array of
antimicrobial compounds  for  escaping  from  microorganisms by producing some
proteins, which   are   having   antibacterial,   antifungal   activity,  etc.
Antimicrobial peptides  extracted  from plants inhibit the growth of a variety
of fungi, oomycetes, Gram-positive bacterial phytopathogenes and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which contain cysteine residues
abundantly have  been  isolated from plants, and these are classified into the
plant defensin  family.  Plant  defensins can be classified broadly into three
types (hevein  type,  C6  type,  and  C8 type) according to the number and the
position of cysteine residues in the molecules. The C6 type of plant defensins
are highly  basic  proteins that contains 6 cysteine residues and a continuous
sequence of  cysteine  (-CC-).  All  the 6 cysteines are involved in disulfide
bond formation for stabilizing protein tertiary structure [1,2,3,4].

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

The overall  tertiary  structure  of  Ac-AMP2 consists of a centrally located,
twisted anti-parallel beta-sheet, which acts as the core of the protein and is
more or less covered by the rest of the protein (see <PDB:1MMC>) [4].

Some C6 type AMPs are listed below:

 - Mirabilis jalapa AMPs Mj-AMP1 and Mj-AMP2. They exhibit a broad spectrum of
   antifungal activity [1].
 - Phytolacca  americana  (pokeweed)  seeds  AMP  (Pa-AMP-1).  It inhibits the
   growth of several filamentous fungi and gram-positive bacteria [2].
 - Amaranthus  caudatus  AMPs Ac-AMP1 and Ac-AMP2, which are probably involved
   in the  protection  of seeds or seedlings against fungi and microorganisms.
   Although presently  uncertain,  the mode of action is most probably related
   to the fact that they can bind to chitin, a polymer of beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-
   glucosamine [4].
 - Impatiens  balsamina  (balsam) AMPs Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, Ib-AMP3, and Ib-AMP4,
   which play  a  role  in  the defense of the germinating seed against micro-
   organisms, by  inhibiting  the  growth  of a range of filamentous fungi and
   bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria [5].
 - Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (common ice plant) AMP Mc-AMP-1. It possesses
   antifungal and antibacterial activity.

Our signature  pattern  for  plant C6 type antimicrobial peptides contains the
six conserved  cysteines  involved  in  disulfide  bonds with knottin scaffold
[E1].

-Consensus pattern: C-[IV]-x(2,4)-[RG]-C-x(2,6)-[GP]-x-C-C-S-x(2,4)-C-
                    x-{C}-x(4,8)-C
                    [The 6 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
