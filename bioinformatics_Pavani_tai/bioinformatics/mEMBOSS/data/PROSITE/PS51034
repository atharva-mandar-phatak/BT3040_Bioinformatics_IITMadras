* ZP domain signature and profile *
***********************************

The zona  pellucida  (ZP)  domain  is  a protein polymerization module of ~260
amino acid  module,  which  is  found  at  the  C-terminus  of  many  secreted
eukaryotic glycoproteins  that play fundamental roles in development, hearing,
immunity, and cancer [1,2,3,4]:

 - Sperm receptor proteins ZP2 and ZP3.  Along  with protein ZP1, proteins ZP2
   and ZP3 are responsible for sperm-adhesion to the zona pellucida. ZP3 first
   binds to specific sperm proteins, thus  mediating  sperm  contacts with the
   oocyte. ZP2  acts  as a second sperm receptor reinforcing the interactions.
   ZP1 cross-links the polymers formed by ZP2 and ZP3.
 - Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B) (also known as ZP-X in rabbit
   and ZP-3 alpha in pig).
 - Glycoprotein GP2,  the  major  component  of  pancreatic  secretory granule
   membranes.
 - TGF-beta receptor type III (also  known  as betaglycan).  This protein is a
   proteoglycan that binds  to TGF-beta and could be involved in capturing and
   retaining TGF-beta for presentation to the signalling receptors.
 - Uromodulin (also known as Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein). The function
   of this  protein,  which  is  the  most abundant in human urine, is not yet
   clear.
 - Chicken beta-tectorin, a major glycoprotein of avian tectorial membrane.

Most ZP  domain  proteins  are synthesized as precursors with carboxy-terminal
transmembrane domains or glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors [2].

The ZP   domain  contains  eight  strictly  conserved  cysteines,  which  form
disulfide bridges.  The disulfide bonds within the ZP domains are divided into
two groups,  suggesting  that  the  ZP  domain  consists of two subdomains. In
addition to  the conserved cysteines, only a few aromatic or hydrophobic amino
acids are absolutely invariant, probably as a result of structural rather than
functional constraints [1,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire ZP domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYW]-x(7)-[STAPDNLR]-x(3)-[LIVMFYW]-x-[LIVMFYW]-x-
                    [LIVMFYW]-x(2)-C-[LIVMFYW]-x-[STA]-[PSLT]-x(2,4)-[DENSG]-
                    x-[STADNQLFM]-x(6)-[LIVM](2)-x(3,4)-C
                    [The 2 C's may be involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Endoglins  are  reported  to  contain  a region of homology with the N-
 terminal third  of the ZP domain [5]. This truncated version of the ZP domain
 is not recognized by the profile.
