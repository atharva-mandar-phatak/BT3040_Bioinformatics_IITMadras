* W2 domain profile *
*********************

Translation initiation   is   a   sophisticated,  well  regulated  and  highly
coordinated cellular  process  in  eukaryotes, in which at least 11 eukayrotic
initiation factors   (eIFs)   are  included.  The  W2  domain  (two  invariant
tryptophans) is  a region of ~165 amino acids which is found in the C-terminus
of the following eIFs [1-5]:

 - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B epsilon (eIF-2B-epsilon).
 - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF-4-gamma).
 - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5), a GTPase-activating
   protein (GAP) specific for eIF2.

The W2  domain  has  a globular fold and is exclusively composed out of alpha-
helices (see <PDB:2FUL>) [3-5]. The structure can be divided into a structural
C-terminal core  onto  which the two N-terminal helices are attached. The core
contains two  aromatic/acidic  residue-rich  regions  (AA  boxes),  which  are
important for mediating protein-protein interactions.

The profile we developed covers the entire W2 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
