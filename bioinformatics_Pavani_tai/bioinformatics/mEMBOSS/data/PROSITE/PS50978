* NEAT domain profile *
***********************

The NEAT  (for  'near  transporter') domain is a conserved region of about 125
amino acids,  which  appears  in variable copy number (from one up to five) in
bacterial genes  that  are  usually  in  the  vicinity  of  a  putative Fe(3+)
siderophore transporter.  Most of the bacterial species containing this domain
are pathogenic.  The  NEAT  domain is found in combination with other domains,
such as  the  LRR  or  the  LPxTG motif (see <PDOC00373>). Given its predicted
extracellular location  and  its  close  association with the components of an
iron transport  system,  one  possible  function of the NEAT domain is to be a
receptor of the siderophore-iron complex [1].

The predicted secondary structure of the NEAT domain suggests that this domain
is mostly composed of beta strands [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire NEAT domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
