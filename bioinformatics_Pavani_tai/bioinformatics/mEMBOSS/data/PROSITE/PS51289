* Cysteine-rich GLG1 repeat *
*****************************

The  Golgi  apparatus  protein 1 (GLG1), which is located in Golgi cisterns of
various  cell types, can bind fibroblast growth factor and E-selectin. Sixteen
cysteine-rich GLG1 repeats form the core of the protein and are located in the
lumen. The C-terminal part of GLG1 is composed of a transmembrane region and a
short  cytoplasmic  tail.  The Cys-rich GLG1 repeat is a ~60 amino acid module
that  contains  4  Cys  residues,  which can form intrachain disulfide bridges
[1,2].  Homologues  of  the  vertebrate  GLG1/Golgi  sialoglycoprotein  MG-160
(Mg160)/E-selectin  ligand  1  (ESL1)/cysteine-rich  fibroblast  growth factor
receptor  1  (CFR1)/latent  transforming  growth factor-beta complex protein 1
(LTCP-1) have been found in insects and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

The profile we developed covers the entire cysteine-rich GLG1 repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: January 2007 / First entry.
