* Bacterial microcompartiments proteins signature *
***************************************************

A family  of  small bacterial proteins has been recently discovered [1,2] that
seem to  be  involved  in  the formation of specific microcompartiments in the
cell in  which  the  metabolism  of potentially toxic by-products takes place.
The proteins that belong to this family are:

 - Escherichia   coli   and  Salmonella  typhimurium  cchA,  involved  in  the
   degradation of ethanolamine.
 - Salmonella typhimurium pduA, involved in 1,2-propanediol metabolism.
 - Synechococcus ccmK, involved  in  the formation of the carboxysome which is
   a polyhedral inclusion where RuBisCO is sequestred.
 - Thiobacillus  neapolitanus  carboxysome  shell  proteins csoS1A, csoS1B and
   csoS1C.
 - A  number  of  hypothetical  Synechococcus proteins which are also probably
   involved in the carboxysome shell formation.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yffI.

These proteins  have  from 90 to 120 amino acid residues with the exception of
two Synechococcus  hypothetical  proteins  which contains respectively 275 and
297 amino  acids  and which are made up of two tandem homologous domains. As a
signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in their N-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: D-x(0,1)-M-x-K-[SAG](2)-x-[IV]-x-[LIVM]-[LIVMA]-[GCSY]-
                    x(4)-[GDE]-[SGPDR]-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
