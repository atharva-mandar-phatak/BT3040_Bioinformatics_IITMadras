* Ribosomal protein S4 signature *
**********************************

Ribosomal protein S4 is  one of the proteins from the small ribosomal subunit.
In Escherichia  coli,    S4  is  known to bind  directly to 16S ribosomal RNA.
Mutations in  S4  have been shown to increase translational error frequencies.
It belongs  to a family of ribosomal  proteins which, on the basis of sequence
similarities [1,2], groups:

 - Eubacterial S4.
 - Algal and plant chloroplast S4.
 - Cyanelle S4.
 - Archaebacterial S4.
 - Mammalian S9.
 - Yeast YS11 (SUP46).
 - Marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial S4.
 - Dictyostelium discoideum rp1024.
 - Yeast protein NAM9 [3]. NAM9 has been characterized  as  a  suppressor  for
   ochre mutations in mitochondrial DNA.  It could be a ribosomal protein that
   acts as a suppressor by decreasing translation accuracy.

S4 is  a  protein  of 171 to 205 amino-acid residues (except for NAM9 which is
much larger).  The  signature pattern for this protein is based on a conserved
region located in the central section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[DERA]-x-R-[LI]-x(3)-[LIVMC]-[VMFYHQL]-[KRTS]-x(3)-
                    [STAGCVF]-x-[ST]-x(3)-[SAI]-[KRQ]-x-[LIVMF](2)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
