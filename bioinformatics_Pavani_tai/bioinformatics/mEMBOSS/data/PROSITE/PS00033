* 'Homeobox' engrailed-type protein signature *
***********************************************

Most proteins  which contain a 'homeobox' domain  can  be classified [1,2], on
the basis of their sequence characteristics, in three  subfamilies: engrailed,
antennapedia and paired.   Proteins currently known to belong to the engrailed
subfamily are:

 - Drosophila segmentation polarity protein engrailed (en) which specifies the
   body segmentation  pattern  and  is  required  for  the  development of the
   central nervous system.
 - Drosophila invected protein (inv).
 - Silk moth proteins engrailed and invected,  which  may  be  involved in the
   compartmentalization of the silk gland.
 - Honeybee E30 and E60.
 - Grasshopper (Schistocerca americana) G-En.
 - Mammalian and birds En-1 and En-2.
 - Zebrafish  Eng-1, -2 and -3.
 - Sea urchin (Tripneusteas gratilla) SU-HB-en.
 - Leech (Helobdella triserialis) Ht-En.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ceh-16.

Engrailed homeobox proteins are characterized  by  the presence of a conserved
region of  some  20  amino-acid  residues  located  at  the  C-terminal of the
'homeobox' domain.  As  a signature pattern for this subfamily of proteins, we
have used a stretch of eight perfectly conserved residues in this region.

-Consensus pattern: L-M-A-[EQ]-G-L-Y-N
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ceh-16.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
