***************************************************

C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylases (EC 2.1.1.37) (C5 Mtase) are enzymes that
specifically methylate  the  C-5  carbon  of  cytosines  in  DNA [1,2,3]. Such
enzymes are found in the proteins described below.

 - As a component of type II  restriction-modification  systems in prokaryotes
   and some  bacteriophages.    Such enzymes recognize a specific DNA sequence
   where they  methylate  a  cytosine.  In  doing  so,  they  protect DNA from
   cleavage by  type  II restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence.
   The sequences of a large number of type II C-5 Mtases are known.
 - In vertebrates, there  are  a  number  of  C-5 Mtases  that  methylate  CpG
   dinucleotides. The sequence of the mammalian enzyme is known.

C-5 Mtases share a number of short conserved regions. We selected two of them.
The first  is  centered  around  a  conserved  Pro-Cys  dipeptide in which the
cysteine has  been  shown  [4]  to be involved in the catalytic mechanism;  it
appears to  form a covalent intermediate with the C6 position of cytosine. The
second region is located at the C-terminal extremity in type-II enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [DENKS]-x-[FLIV]-x(2)-[GSTC]-x-P-C-x-{V}-[FYWLIM]-S
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for M.MthtI.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.

-Consensus pattern: [RKQGTF]-x(2)-G-N-[SA]-[LIVF]-x-[VIP]-x-[LVMT]-x(3)-
                    [LIVM]-x(3)-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for M.AluI, M.HgaI 1 and 2, and M.HpaII.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note: In the first position of the second pattern, most known Mtases have Arg
 or Lys.
