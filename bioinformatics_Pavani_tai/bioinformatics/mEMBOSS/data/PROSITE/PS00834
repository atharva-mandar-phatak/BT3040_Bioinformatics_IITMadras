* Aspartyl proteases, omptin family signatures *
************************************************

Escherichia coli  protease  VII  (EC 3.4.21.87) (omptin) (gene ompT) [1] is an
outer-membrane associated   protease  with  a  specificity  for  paired  basic
residues. It  seems  to  be  an  aspartyl protease [2] inhibited by zinc ions.
Omptin is highly similar to the following proteins:

 - Salmonella  typhimurium  outer  membrane   protease E (gene pgtE) [3], also
   specific for paired basic residues.
 - Yersinia pestis coagulase/fibrinolysin  (plasminogen activator) (gene  pla)
   [4]. This  enzyme  is  encoded  on  a  plasmid required  for the pathogenic
   potential of the bacteria. It cleaves and activates plasminogen at the foci
   of infection; this allows plasmin to degrade fibrin barriers thus promoting
   the invasiveness of the plague bacteria.
 - Escherichia coli outer membrane protease ompP [5].

The mature  forms of these enzymes are proteins of about 280 to 300 amino-acid
residues. As signature patterns, we selected two well conserved regions in the
central part of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: W-T-D-x-S-x-H-P-x-T
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: A-G-Y-Q-E-[ST]-R-[FYW]-S-[FYW]-[TN]-A-x-G-G-[ST]-Y
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family A26 in the classification of peptidases
 [6,E1].
