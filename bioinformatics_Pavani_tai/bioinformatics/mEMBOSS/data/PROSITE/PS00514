* Fibrinogen C-terminal domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

Fibrinogen,  the  principal  protein of vertebrate blood clotting is a hexamer
containing two sets of three different chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), linked
to each other by disulfide bonds [1,2]. The N-terminal sections of these three
chains  contain  the  cysteines  that  participate in the cross-linking of the
chains.  The  C-terminal  parts  of the alpha, beta and gamma chains contain a
domain  of  about  225  amino-acid residues, which can function as a molecular
recognition  unit  [2-6]. In fibrinogen as well as in angiopoietin this domain
is  implicated  in protein-protein interactions. In lectins, such as mammalian
ficolins  and  invertebrate  tachylectin  5A, the fibrinogen C-terminal domain
binds  carbohydrates.  As  shown  in  the schematic representation this domain
contains four conserved cysteines involved in two disulfide bonds.

'*': position of the pattern.
'A,B,P': regions within the domain

The 3D structure of the fibrinogen C-terminal domain (see <PDB:1FZA; F>) shows
a fold composed of three separate regions [2,5-7]. The N-terminal region, also
termed  A  domain,  forms  a helix and a beta-sheet held together by the first
disulfide  bond.  The  second  region,  or B domain, is the largest. The third
region,  also  termed  P domain, forms long extended coil regions and contains
the  C-terminal  disulfide  bond.  This  P  region  is  the most divergent and
contains  most  ligand  binding sites and in some cases residues implicated in
calcium binding.

Some proteins known to contain a fibrinogen C-terminal domain:

 - Vertebrate fibrinogen alpha, beta and gamma chains.
 - Mammalian   tenascin-X,  an  extracellular  matrix  protein  that  mediates
   interactions  between  cells  and  the extracellular matrix and accelerates
   collagen  fibril  formation.  The  C-terminal  fibrinogen domain binds with
   fibrillar proteins in the extracellular matrix.
 - Vertebrate  angiopoietin  proteins,  which  contain a C-terminal fibrinogen
   domain that interacts with tyrosine-protein kinase receptor TIE2.
 - Mammalian prothrombinase or fibroleukin.
 - Sea cucumber fibrinogen-like protein A.
 - Fruit  fly  protein  scabrous  (gene  sca).  Scabrous  is  involved  in the
   regulation of neurogenesis in Drosophila and may encode a lateral inhibitor
   of R8 cells differentiation.
 - Horseshoe   crab   techylectin-5A,  a  nonself-recognizing  lectin  with  a
   fibrinogen C-terminal domain that recognizes carbohydrates.
 - Mammalian ficolins, with a collagen-like domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen
   domain  that contains potential calcium-binding sites and can interact with
   GlcNAc.

As  a  signature  pattern  for  this domain, we selected the region around the
fourth cysteine. We also developed a profile that covers the entire fibrinogen
C-terminal domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: In  contactin-associated proteins (Cntnap/Caspr) and intelectins (Itln)
 only the  N-terminal  'A'  region of the fibrinogen C-terminal domain is well
 conserved and detected.
