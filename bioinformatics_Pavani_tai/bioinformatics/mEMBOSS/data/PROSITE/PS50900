* PLAC domain profile *
***********************

The PLAC  (protease  and  lacunin) domain is a six cysteine region of about 40
residues which is present at or near the C-termini of:

 - Mammalian  paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4).
 - Mammalian proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5).
 - Mammalian metalloproteases ADAMTS-2, -3, -10, -12, -14, -16, -17 and -19.
 - Manduca  sexta lacunin, a matrix protein that is also dynamically expressed
   on basal  surfaces  of  epithelial cells during embryonic and postembryonic
   and morphogenesis.

The PLAC   domain   is  found  associated  with  other  domains  such  as  the
thrombospondin type  I  repeat (TSP1) (see <PDOC50092>), the Kunitz proteinase
inhibitor domain  (see <PDOC00252>), the Ig-like domain (see <PDOC50835>), the
WAP domain,   the  subtilase  domain  (see  <PDOC00125>),  or  the  ADAM  type
metalloprotease domain  (see  <PDOC50215>). The function of the PLAC domain is
not yet known [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire PLAC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: October 2003 / First entry.
