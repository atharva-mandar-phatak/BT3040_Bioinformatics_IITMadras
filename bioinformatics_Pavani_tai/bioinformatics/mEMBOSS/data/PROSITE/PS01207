* Glypicans signature *
***********************

Glypicans [1,2]  are  a  family  of  heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans which are
anchored to  cell  membranes  by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage.
Structurally, these proteins consist of three separate domains:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) An  extracellular  domain of about 500 residues that contains 12 conserved
    cysteines probably involved in disulfide bonds and which also contains the
    sites of attachment of the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains;
 c) A  C-terminal  hydrophobic  region  which  is post-translationally removed
    after formation of the GPI-anchor.

The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Glypican 1 (GPC1).
 - Glypican 2 (GPC2) or cerebroglycan.
 - Glypican 3 (GPC3) or OCI-5.  In man,  defects in GPC3 are the cause of a X-
   linked genetic disease, Simpson-Galabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS).
 - Glypican 4 (GPC4) or K-glypican.
 - Glypican 5 (GPC5).
 - Glypican 6 (GPC6).
 - Drosophila protein dally.

The signature  pattern  that  we  developed  for  glypicans  is located in the
central section of the extracellular domain and contains five of the conserved
cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x-[GS]-[LIVM]-x(4)-P-C-x(2)-[FY]-C-x(2)-[LIVM]-
                    x(2)-G-C
                    [The C's are probably involved in a disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for dally.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
