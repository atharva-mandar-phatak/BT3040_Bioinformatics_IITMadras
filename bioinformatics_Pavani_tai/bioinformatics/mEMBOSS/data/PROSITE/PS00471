* Small cytokines (intercrine/chemokine) signatures *
*****************************************************

Many low-molecular  weight  factors  secreted  by cells including fibroblasts,
macrophages and  endothelial cells,  in  response  to  a  variety  of  stimuli
such as  growth factors,  interferons,  viral  transformation   and  bacterial
products, are structurally related [1,2,3,E1]. Most members of this  family of
proteins seem to have mitogenic, chemotactic or inflammatory activities. These
small cytokines are also  called intercrines or chemokines.  They are cationic
proteins of 70 to 100  amino  acid residues that share four conserved cysteine
residues involved in  two disulfide bonds, as shown in the following schematic
representation:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

These proteins can be  sorted into two  groups based on the spacing of the two
amino-terminal cysteines.  In the first group, the two cysteines are separated
by a  single  residue  (C-x-C),  while  in the second group, they are adjacent
(C-C).

The 'C-x-C' group is currently known to consist of the following proteins:

 - Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein released from platelet alpha-granules as
   a complex with a proteoglycan molecule.   PF4 neutralizes the anticoagulant
   effect of heparin because  it  binds  more strongly  to heparin than to the
   chondroitin-4-sulfate chains  of  the  carrier molecule. PF4 is chemotactic
   for neutrophils and monocytes.
 - Platelet basic protein (PBP), which is the precursor of two active peptides:
   connective-tissue  activating  peptide III (CTAP III)   (also known as low-
   affinity platelet factor IV (LA-PF4)) and beta-thromboglobulin. CTAP-III is
   a growth  factor  that  stimulates a  variety  of  specific  metabolic  and
   cellular activities.
 - Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a monokine  which is  released  from monocytes  by an
   inflammatory response and which is selectively chemotactic for neutrophils.
   IL-8 is  also  known  as  Monocyte-Derived  Neutrophil  Chemotactic  Factor
   (MDNCF), or as Neutrophil Activating Protein 1 (NAP-1).
 - Melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA), a  growth  factor with
   potent mitogenic activity.  MGSA  is also  known  as  Neutrophil Activating
   Protein 3  (NAP-3)  or  as 'gro', as KC or N51 in mouse and as CICN in rat.
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), an extremely potent  chemotactic
   agent for polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
 - Mouse Mig (m119), a gamma-interferon induced protein that may be a cytokine
   affecting the   growth,   movement   or  activation  state  of  cells  that
   participate in immune and inflammatory response.
 - Chicken 9E3 (or pCEF-4), a protein expressed constitutively in Rous Sarcoma
   virus (RSV)  infected  cells  and  which  may  be  an autocrine factor that
   promotes the growth of fibroblasts.
 - Pig alveolar macrophage chemotactic factors I and I (AMCF-I and -II).
 - Pre-B cell growth stimulating factor (PBSF) (stromal cell-derived factor 1)
   (SDF-1).
 - IP10, a gamma-interferon induced protein which is chemotactic for monocytes
   and T lymphocytes.

The 'C-C' group is currently known to consist of the following proteins:

 - Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)  [Also known as monocyte chemotactic
   and activating factor (MCAF); JE].
 - Monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP-2).
 - Monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP-3) [Also known as MARC; FIC].
 - Monocyte chemotactic protein 4 (MCP-4) [Also known as NCC-1].
 - Macrophage  inflammatory  protein 1 alpha (MIP-1-alpha) [Also known as SIS-
   alpha; TY-5; L2G25B; PAT 464.1; GOS19-1].
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta  (MIP-1-beta) [Also  known  as  SIS-
   gamma; H400; ACT-2; PAT 744].
 - Macrophage  inflammatory  protein  1  gamma  (MIP-1-gamma)  [Also  known as
   macrophage inflammatory protein-related protein-2 (MRP2)].
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP-3-alpha)  [Also known as Liver
   and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (LARC)].
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 3 beta  (MIP-3-beta)  [Also  known as EBI1-
   Ligand Chemokine (ELC)].
 - Macrophage  inflammatory  protein  4  (MIP-4)  [Also known as Pulmonary and
   Activation-Regulated Chemokine (PARC)].
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 5 (MIP-5) [Also known as HCC-2; NCC-3].
 - LD78 beta (also known as PAT 464.2 or GOS19-2).
 - RANTES [Also known as SIS-delta].
 - SIS-epsilon (p500).
 - Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC).
 - Eotaxin [Also known as eosinophil chemotactic protein].
 - I-309 [Also known as TCA3].
 - Human protein HCC-1/NCC-2.
 - Human protein HCC-3.
 - Mouse protein C10.

For each of the two groups of proteins, we  have developed a signature pattern
spanning the region that includes the four conserved cysteines.
