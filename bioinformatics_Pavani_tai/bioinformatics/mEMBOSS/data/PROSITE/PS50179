* VHS domain profile *
**********************

The VHS  domain  is  an  about 150 residues long domain, whose name is derived
from its occurrence in VPS-27, Hrs and STAM. The VHS domain is found at the N-
termini of  proteins associated with endocytocis and/or vesicular trafficking,
often in  association with other domains like FYVE (see <PDOC50178>), SH3 (see
<PDOC50002>) or  TAM  [1,2].  The  VHS  domain  of  Hrs  makes both intra- and
intermolecular interactions with FYVE domains and it has been proposed that it
might as  well interact with other domains. The VHS domain might function as a
multipurpose docking  adapter  that localizes proteins to the membrane through
interactions with the membrane and/or the endocytic machinery [3,4].

Resolution of  the  crystal  structure of the VHS domain of Drosophila Hrs and
human Tom1 revealed that it consists of eight helices arranged in a superhelix
[3,4].

Some proteins known to contain a VHS domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  VPS27,  which controls membrane trafficking through the prevacuolar/
   endosomal compartment.
 - Animal  Hrs  (hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate)
   is found  on the surface of early endosome and may play a role in vesicular
   transport.
 - Mammalian Hrs-2, which modulates vesicle trafficking in neurotransmission.
 - Animal STAM (signal-transducing adaptor molecule), which interacts with Hrs
   and may therefore be involved in endocytosis/vesicular transport.
 - Avian  EAST  (epidermal  growth factor receptor-associated protein with SH3
   and TAM domains), which colocalizes with clathrin in vesicular structure.
 - Vertebrate   Tom1  and  Tom1-like.  Tom1  may  help  to  regulate  membrane
   trafficking in  response  to c-Myb activity during cellular differentiation
   or transformation.
 - Avian Tom-1b.
 - Human Golgi localized gamma-ear containing ARF binding (GGA) proteins. GGAs
   are localized to the trans-Golgi network and late Golgi membranes.

The profile we developed covers the entire VHS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
