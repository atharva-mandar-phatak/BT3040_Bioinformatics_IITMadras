* TIR domain profile *
**********************

Toll  proteins  or  Toll-like  receptors (TLRs) and the interleukin-1 receptor
(IL-1R)  superfamily  are both involved in innate antibacterial and antifungal
immunity  in  insects as well as in mammals. These receptors share a conserved
cytoplasmic  domain  of approximately 200 amino acids, known as the Toll/IL-1R
homologous  region  (TIR).  The  similarity  between  TLRs  and  IL-1Rs is not
restricted  to  sequence  homology  since  these proteins also share a similar
signaling pathway. They both induce the activation of a Rel type transcription
factor  via an adaptor protein and a protein kinase [1]. Interestingly, MyD88,
a  cytoplasmic  adaptor  protein  found  in  mammals,  contains  a  TIR domain
associated to  a DEATH domain (see <PDOC50017>) [2,3,4]. Besides the mammalian
and  Drosophila  proteins,  a  TIR  domain  is also found in a number of plant
cytoplasmic proteins implicated in host defense [5].

Site directed mutagenesis and deletion analysis have shown that the TIR domain
is  essential  for  Toll  and  IL-1R  activities.  A principal function of TIR
domains  is thought to be to mediate homotypic protein-protein interactions in
the  signal  transduction  process  [6].  Sequence  analyses have revealed the
presence  of three highly conserved regions among the different members of the
TIR  family:  box  1  (FDAFISY), box 2 (GYKLC-RD-PG), and box 3 (a conserved W
surrounded  by  basic  residues).  It has been proposed that boxes 1 and 2 are
involved  in  the  binding of proteins involved in signaling, whereas box 3 is
primarily  involved  in  directing  localization  of receptor, perhaps through
interactions with cytoskeletal elements [7].

Resolution  of  the  crystal  structures of the TIR domains of human Toll-like
receptors 1 and 2 has shown that they contain a central five-stranded parallel
beta-sheet that is surrounded by a total of five helices on both sides [8].

Some proteins known to contain a TIR domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  interleukin-1  receptor.  It  is composed of two type I integral
   membrane proteins,   IL-1R  and  IL-1RacP,  that  share  three  Ig  domains
   (extracellular) and one TIR domain (cytoplasmic) [7].
 - Myeloid  differentiation  factor  (MyD88),  a  cytoplasmic protein found in
   mammals. It  also contains a DEATH domain and acts as an adaptor protein in
   IL-1R and TLR mediated signaling [2,3,4].
 - Toll,  from  Drosophila.  The  Toll  signaling  pathway is required for the
   establishment of  the  dorso-ventral axis during embryogenesis and plays an
   important role  in  the  immune  response  against bacteria and fungi. Toll
   contains two  extracellular  LRRs, adjacent cysteine containing motifs, one
   transmembrane domain,  an  intracellular  TIR  domain  and an intracellular
   inhibitory domain [4].
 - LRR  and  TIR  domains  containing  proteins from plants. These cytoplasmic
   proteins are important in the host response to infection [5].

We developed a profile that covers the entire TIR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
