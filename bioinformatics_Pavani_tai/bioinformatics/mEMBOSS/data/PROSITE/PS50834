* HIN-200 A and B domains profile *
***********************************

Interferons (IFNs)   are  cytokines  that  regulate  host  resistance  against
infections by   exerting   antimicrobial,  immunomodulatory  and  cell  growth
regulatory functions.   Following  their  binding  to  specific  cell  surface
receptors, they  induce the expression of a defined set of genes that elicit a
number of  cellular responses. The HIN-200 (hematopoietic interferon-inducible
nuclear proteins  with a 200-amino-acid repeat) gene family found on human and
mouse chromosome  1  is  positively regulated by INFs. The murine HIN-200 gene
family consists  of  at  least  four members designated 202, 203, 204, and D3,
while the  human  HIN-200  family  members  include IFI16, the myeloid nuclear
differentiation antigen (MNDA), and AIM-2 (absent in melanoma 2). All proteins
encoded by  these  genes  translocate  to  the  nucleus following induction of
expression by INFs. HIN-200 proteins play a role in modulating cell growth and
perhaps in  vivo  differentiation.  Some  family  members  are transcriptional
regulators, acting  either directly by binding DNA or indirectly by modulating
the function  of  other  cellular  transcription factors. They are hydrophilic
proteins lacking  signal  sequences and transmembrane region. All the proteins
belonging to  the  HIN-200  family  contain  one  or  two  200 amino acid long
conserved motifs,  designated as the type A and type B domains, in addition to
other regions  that are different or missing among the various family members.
These 200-amino-acid regions are unique to the HIN-200 proteins and contain no
known functional  motifs  that  could provide some clue to their physiological
relevance. However,  there  are stretches of amino acids, such as the sequence
MFHATVAT, that  exhibit almost complete identity across the A and B domains of
all family members. Altough the function of the HIN-200 domains A and B is not
known, it  has  been  shown that the inhibition of cell growth by some HIN-200
proteins requires both domains [1,2,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire HIN-200 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
