********************************************
* Alpha-type protein kinase domain profile *
********************************************

The  alpha-kinases  were  initially  identified  because of the experimentally
observed  ability  of EF-2 kinase to phosphorylate elongation factor-2 [1]. It
was  shown  that  the EF-2 kinase and the myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A)
share  a  conserved  region  of about 250 amino acids, the alpha-kinase domain
[2].  The name alpha-kinase was suggested for the family according to existing
evidence that eIF-2 and MHCK A phosphorylate amino acids located within alpha-
helices  whereas  classical  kinase  proteins phosphorylate amino acids within
loops  [3].  Alpha-kinases  are  multi-domain  proteins with a wide variety of
domains  present in the family. These include: ion-channels, VWFA domains (see
<PDOC50234>),  WD-repeats  (see  <PDOC00574>),  TPR-repeats (see <PDOC50005>),
immunoglobulin-like  domains (see <PDOC50835>) and calmodulin binding domains.
Members  of  the  alpha-kinase  family share no detectable sequence similarity
with   the  large  family  of  "classical"  eukaryotic  protein  kinases  (see
<PDOC00100>) [4].

The  crystal  structure  of  the alpha-kinase domain of a TPR channel has been
solved  [5].  The  structure bears a striking resemblance to that of classical
protein kinases in the catalytic core as well as to metabolic enzymes with the
ATP-grasp domain. As in classical kinase the domain consists of two lobes that
bind  nucleotide  at  the  interface between them. The N-terminal lobe is very
similar  in  structure  to  that  of  classical  protein  kinases, whereas its
C-terminal lobe resembles that of ATP-grasp proteins more closely. A conserved
C-terminal  glycine rich motif which locates in the region that corresponds to
the  activation  loop  of  classical  kinases  is  essential for the enzymatic
activity [6]. The C-terminal lobe contains a metal ion which is coordinated by
two histidines and two cysteines.

Proteins known to contain an alpha-kinase domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic  elongation  factor  2  kinase (EC 2.7.11.20) (eEF-2 kinase). It
   phosphorylates eukaryotic elongation factor 2.
 - Dictyostelium  myosin  heavy  chain  kinase  A  (EC  2.7.11.7) (MHCK A). It
   phosphorylates a threonine in the C-terminal tail region of myosin II heavy
   chain. This  phosphorylation    is  critical in regulating the assembly and
   disassembly of myosin II filament.
 - A   mammalian  subclass  of  long  transient  receptor  potential  channels
   (TRPM7/ChaK1).   An  essential  ion  channel  and  serine/threonine-protein
   kinase.
 - Mammalian muscle alpha-kinase.
 - Neurospora alpha-kinase with a VWFA domain.

The profile we developed covers the entire alpha-kinase domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
