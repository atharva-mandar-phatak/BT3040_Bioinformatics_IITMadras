*************************
* TatC family signature *
*************************

The following proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of similarities:

 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yigU and HI0188, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ycbT.
 - Mycobacterium  tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY49.33c and U2126A, the
   corresponding Mycobacterium leprae protein.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein sll0194.
 - Odontella  sinensis  and  Porphyra purpurea chlroplast hypothetical protein
   ycf43.

These proteins  have  from 245 to 317 amino acids and seem to contain at least
six or  seven  transmembrane  regions.  As  a signature pattern, we selected a
conserved region located in the central section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: Y-x(2)-[FL]-[LIVMAFNT]-[LIVMAFT]-x-[LVSI]-x(4)-[GASF]-
                    x(2)-F-[EQ]-[LIVMFC]-P-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
