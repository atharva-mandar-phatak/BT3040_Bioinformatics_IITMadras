* GDA1/CD39 family of nucleoside phosphatases signature *
*********************************************************

A number of nucleoside diphosphate and triphosphate hydrolases as well as some
yet uncharacterized proteins have been found to belong to the same  family [1,
2]. This family currently consist of:

 - Yeast  guanosine-diphosphatase  (EC 3.6.1.42) (GDPase) (gene GDA1). GDA1 is
   a golgi  integral  membrane  enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GDP to
   GMP.
 - Potato  apyrase  (EC  3.6.1.5)  (adenosine diphosphatase) (ADPase). Apyrase
   acts on both ATP and ADP to produce AMP.
 - Mammalian  vascular  ATP-diphosphohydrolase  (EC  3.6.1.5)  (also  known as
   lymphoid cell activation antigen CD39).
 - Toxoplasma gondii nucleoside-triphosphatases (EC 3.6.1.15) (NTPase). NTPase
   hydrolyses various  nucleoside  triphosphates  to produce the corresponding
   nucleoside mono-  and  diphosphates.  This  enzyme  is  secreted  into  the
   invaded host   cell   into   the  parasitophorous  vacuole,  a  specialized
   compartment where the parasite intracellulary resides.
 - Pea nucleoside-triphosphatases (EC 3.6.1.15) (NTPase).

 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C33H5.14.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R07E4.4.
 - Yeast chromosome V hypothetical protein YER005w.

The above uncharacterized proteins all seem to be membrane-bound.

All these  proteins  share a number of conserved domains. We have selected the
best conserved  of  these domains. It is located in the central section of the
proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-G-x(2)-E-G-x-[FYLS]-x-[FW]-[LIVA]-[TAG]-x-N-[HYF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
