* 'Homeobox' domain signature and profile *
*******************************************

The 'homeobox'  is  a  protein  domain  of  60  amino  acids [1 to 5,E1] first
identified in  a   number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins. It
has since been  found to  be  extremely well conserved in many  other animals,
including vertebrates.  This  domain binds DNA through a helix-turn-helix type
of structure.  Some  of  the proteins which contain  a homeobox domain play an
important  role  in  development.  Most of  these  proteins  are  known  to be
sequence specific DNA-binding transcription factors.  The  homeobox domain has
also been found  to  be  very  similar  to  a  region of the yeast mating type
proteins. These are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that act as  master
switches in yeast differentiation  by  controlling  gene  expression in a cell
type-specific fashion.

A  schematic  representation  of  the  homeobox domain  is  shown below.   The
helix-turn-helix region is shown by the symbols  'H' (for helix), and 't' (for
turn).

The pattern we developed to detect homeobox sequences  is 24 residues long and
spans positions 34 to 57 of the homeobox domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYG]-[ASLVR]-x(2)-[LIVMSTACN]-x-[LIVM]-{Y}-x(2)-{L}-
                    [LIV]-[RKNQESTAIY]-[LIVFSTNKH]-W-[FYVC]-x-[NDQTAH]-x(5)-
                    [RKNAIMW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 10 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 9.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Proteins  which  contain  a  homeobox  domain can be classified, on the
 basis of  their  sequence  characteristics, into various subfamilies. We have
 developed specific  patterns  for  conserved  elements  of  the antennapedia,
 engrailed and paired families.
