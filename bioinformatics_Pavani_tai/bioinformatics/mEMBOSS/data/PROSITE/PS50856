* AMOP domain profile *
***********************

The AMOP domain (for adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins) is
an ~100-residue  long  extracellular  domain  that  occurs  in  putative  cell
adhesion molecules  and  in  some  splice  variants of MUC4. It contains eight
invariant cysteines  residues  that  are predicted to be involved in disulfide
bonds. The AMOP domain is found associated with extracellular domains involved
in cell  adhesion,  such  as NIDO, sushi (see <PDOC50923>), somatomedin B (see
<PDOC00453>), VWFD, EGF (see <PDOC00021>), IPT, or TSP1 (see <PDOC50092>). The
presence of  the AMOP domain in cell adhesion molecules could be indicative of
a role for this domain in adhesion [1].

Secondary structure prediction indicates an initial region rich in alpha helix
followed by four beta strands, suggesting a beta-sheet organization for the C-
terminus of the AMOP domain [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire AMOP domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This  profile  contains an additional cut-off value, which only detects
 true full  length  AMOP  domains.  The traditional default cut-off value also
 allows the  detection  of  truncated  AMOP  domains found in some MUC4 splice
 variants.
