* Synaptophysin / synaptoporin signature *
******************************************

Synaptophysin and synaptoporin [1] are structurally related proteins, found in
the membrane of  synaptic vesicles,  which  may function  as ionic  or  solute
channels.  These two glycoproteins  seem to span the membrane four times. Both
their N- and C-termini sequences seem to be cytoplasmically located.

As a signature pattern for  this  family  of  proteins  we  selected  a highly
conserved region located  in the beginning of  the  first  intravesicular loop
just after  the  first transmembrane domain.  This  region contains a cysteine
residue that may be involved in a disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: L-S-V-[DE]-C-x-N-K-T
                    [C may be involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 1991 / First entry.
