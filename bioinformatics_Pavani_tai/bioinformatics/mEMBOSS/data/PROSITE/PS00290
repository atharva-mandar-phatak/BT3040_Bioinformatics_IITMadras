* Immunoglobulins and major histocompatibility complex proteins signature *
***************************************************************************

The basic structure  of immunoglobulin (Ig) [1] molecules is a tetramer of two
light chains  and two heavy chains linked  by disulfide  bonds.  There are two
types of  light chains:  kappa and lambda,  each composed of a constant domain
(CL) and a variable domain (VL).  There are five types of heavy chains: alpha,
delta, epsilon,  gamma  and  mu,  all consisting of a variable domain (VH) and
three (in alpha,  delta  and  gamma)  or  four (in  epsilon and  mu)  constant
domains (CH1 to CH4).

The major histocompatibility complex  (MHC) molecules  are made of two chains.
In class I [2] the alpha  chain is composed of three  extracellular domains, a
transmembrane   region   and a   cytoplasmic tail.   The  beta  chain (beta-2-
microglobulin) is  composed of a single extracellular domain. In class II [3],
both the  alpha and the beta chains are composed of two extracellular domains,
a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail.

It is  known  [4,5]    that  the  Ig  constant  chain  domains  and   a single
extracellular   domain   in each  type  of  MHC   chains are related.    These
homologous domains  are  approximately    one    hundred amino  acids long and
include a conserved intradomain disulfide bond.  We developed  a small pattern
around the C-terminal cysteine involved  in  this  disulfide bond which can be
used to detect these category of Ig related proteins.
