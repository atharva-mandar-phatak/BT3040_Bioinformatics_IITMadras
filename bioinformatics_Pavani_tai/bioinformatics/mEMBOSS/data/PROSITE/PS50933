* CHRD domain profile *
***********************

The CHRD  (after the gene name of chordin) is a domain of about 120-amino acid
residues that is found in:

 - Vertebrate chordin, an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic proteins,
 - Ascidian orthologue of chordin,
 - Drosophila short gastrulation (SOG), the orthologue of chordin,
 - Microbial proteins from cyanobacteria, soil bacteria and human pathogens.

Whereas chordin contains four copies of the CHRD domain, most of the bacterial
CHRD containing proteins have only a single copy. This indicates that the CHRD
domain is an independent domain and folding unit. The CHRD domain can be found
in stand-alone  form,  or  in  association  with other domains such as the von
Willebrand factor  type  C  domain  (see  <PDOC00928>)  and the hemolysin-type
calcium-binding domain  (see  <PDOC00293>). The function of the CHRD domain is
not yet known [1].

The most  conserved feature of the CHRD domain is the C-terminal G-E-[IL]-R-C-
Q-[VIL] motif.  No  single residue is fully conserved between all the domains,
but several highly conserved positions can be found between the microbial CHRD
domains. Many  of  these  residues  are  also  present  in the third repeat of
chordin, which  raises  the possibility that the other domains in chordin have
lost the  original function and gained a new, perhaps structural or regulatory
role. The  CHRD domain has been predicted to have an immunoglobulin-like beta-
barrel structure [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire CHRD domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
