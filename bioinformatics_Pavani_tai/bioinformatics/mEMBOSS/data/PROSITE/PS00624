* GMC oxidoreductases signatures *
**********************************

The following  FAD  flavoproteins oxidoreductases have  been found [1,2] to be
evolutionary related. These  enzymes, which  are called 'GMC oxidoreductases',
are listed below.

 - Glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) (GOX) from Aspergillus niger.
   Reaction catalyzed: glucose  +  oxygen ->  delta-gluconolactone +  hydrogen
   peroxide.
 - Methanol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.13) (MOX) from fungi.
   Reaction catalyzed: methanol + oxygen -> acetaldehyde + hydrogen peroxide.
 - Choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1) (CHD) from bacteria.
   Reaction catalyzed: choline  + acceptor -> betaine  acetaldehyde  + reduced
   acceptor.
 - Glucose dehydrogenase (GLD) (EC 1.1.99.10) from Drosophila.
   Reaction catalyzed:  glucose  +  acceptor -> delta-gluconolactone + reduced
   acceptor.
 - L-sorbose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.32) (SDH) from Gluconobacter oxydans.
   Reaction catylzed:  L-sorbose  +  acceptor  = 1-dehydro-L-sorbose + reduced
   acceptor.
 - Cholesterol oxidase (CHOD) (EC 1.1.3.6)  from Brevibacterium sterolicum and
   Streptomyces strain SA-COO.
   Reaction catalyzed: cholesterol + oxygen ->  cholest-4-en-3-one  + hydrogen
   peroxide.
 - AlkJ [3],  an  alcohol  dehydrogenase   from  Pseudomonas oleovorans, which
   converts aliphatic medium-chain-length alcohols into aldehydes.
 - Cellobiose    dehydrogenase   (CDH)   (EC  1.1.98.18)  from   Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium.

This family also includes a lyase:

 - (R)-mandelonitrile lyase (EC 4.1.2.10) (hydroxynitrile lyase)  from  plants
   [4], an enzyme involved in cyanogenis, the release of hydrogen cyanide from
   injured tissues.

These enzymes are  proteins  of size ranging from 556 (CHD) to 664 (MOX) amino
acid residues which share a number of regions of sequence similarities. One of
these regions, located in the N-terminal section,  corresponds to the FAD ADP-
binding domain.  The function of the other conserved domains is not yet known;
we have selected two of these domains as signature patterns.  The first one is
located in  the N-terminal  section of these  enzymes, about 50 residues after
the ADP-binding  domain,  while  the  second  one  is  located  in the central
section.
