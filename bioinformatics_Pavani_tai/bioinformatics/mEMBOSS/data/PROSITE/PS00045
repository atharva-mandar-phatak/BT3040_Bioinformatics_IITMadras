* Bacterial histone-like DNA-binding proteins signature *
*********************************************************

Bacteria  synthesize  a set  of  small,  usually  basic proteins  of  about 90
residues that bind DNA and are known as histone-like proteins [1,2]. The exact
function of  these proteins is not yet clear but they  are capable of wrapping
DNA and   stabilizing   it   from  denaturation  under  extreme  environmental
conditions.  The sequence of a number of different types  of these proteins is
known:

 - The HU proteins, which, in Escherichia coli, are a dimer of closely related
   alpha and  beta  chains  and,  in other bacteria, can be dimer of identical
   chains. HU-type  proteins  have  been  found  in  a  variety of eubacteria,
   cyanobacteria and archaebacteria, and are also encoded  in  the chloroplast
   genome of some algae [3].
 - The integration host factor (IHF), a dimer of  closely related chains which
   seem to  function  in genetic recombination as well as in translational and
   transcriptional control [4] in enterobacteria.
 - The bacteriophage sp01 transcription factor 1 (TF1) which selectively binds
   to and inhibits  the  transcription  of hydroxymethyluracil-containing DNA,
   such as sp01 DNA, by RNA polymerase in vitro.
 - The African Swine fever virus protein A104R (or LMW5-AR) [5].

As a signature pattern for  this family of proteins,  we use a  twenty residue
sequence which includes three perfectly conserved positions.  According to the
tertiary structure  of  one  of these proteins [6], this pattern spans exactly
the first half of the flexible DNA-binding arm.

-Consensus pattern: [GSK]-F-x(2)-[LIVMF]-x(4)-[RKEQA]-x(2)-[RST]-x(1,2)-[GA]-
                    x-[KN]-P-x-[TN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
