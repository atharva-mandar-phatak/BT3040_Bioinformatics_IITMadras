The term  vitamin  B6 is used to refer collectively to the compound pyridoxine
and its  vitameric  forms,  pyridoxal,  pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated
derivatives. Vitamin  B6  is  required by all organisms and plays an essential
role as   a  co-factor  for  enzymatic  reactions.  Plants,  fungi,  bacteria,
archaebacteria, and  protists  synthetize  vitamin B6. Animals and some highly
specialized obligate  pathogens  obtain  it  nutritionally. Vitamin B6 has two
distinct biosynthetic  pathways,  which  do  not  coexist in any organism. The
pdxA/pdxJ pathway,  that  has  been  extensively  characterized in Escherichia
coli, is  found  in  the  gamma  subdivision  of  the proteobacteria. A second
pathway of  vitamin  B6  synthesis  involving  the  pdxS/SNZ and pdxT/SNO (see
<PDOC00950>) protein  families,  which are completely unrelated in sequence to
the pdxA/pdxJ  proteins,  is found in plants, fungi, protists, archaebacteria,
and most bacteria.

PdxS/SNZ and  pdxT/SNO  proteins  form  a  complex which serves as a glutamine
amidotransferase to supply ammonia as a source of the ring nitrogen of vitamin
B6 [1].  PdxT/SNO  and  pdxS/SNZ appear to encode respectively the glutaminase
subunit, which  produces  ammonia  from  glutamine,  and the synthase subunit,
which combines  ammonia  with  five-  and  three-carbon  phosphosugars to form
vitamin B6 [2].

Proteins belonging  to the pdxS/SNZ family occur in organisms in four kingdoms
and form one of the most highly conserved family [3]. PdxS/SNZ proteins have a
classic (beta/alpha)8-barrel  fold,  consisting of eight parallel beta-strands
alternating with eight alpha helices (see <PDB:1ZNN>) [4].

Some proteins belonging to the pdxS/SNZ family are listed below:

 - Bacillus subtilis pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Haemophilus influenzae pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Mycobacterium leprae pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Archaeoglobus fulgidus pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Methanococcus vannielii pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum pyridoxine biosynthesis protein pdxS.
 - Cercospora  nicotianae  pyridoxine  biosynthesis  protein  PDX1  or singlet
   oxygen resistance protein 1 (SOR1).
 - Yeast pyridoxin biosynthesis protein SNZ1 (PDX1 homolog 1).
 - Yeast probable pyridoxin biosynthesis protein SNZ2 (PDX1 homolog 2).
 - Yeast probable pyridoxin biosynthesis protein SNZ3 (PDX1 homolog 3).
 - Fission yeast probable pyridoxin biosynthesis PDX1-like protein.
 - Hevea  brasiliensis  probable  pyridoxin  biosynthesis  protein  ER1  (PDX1
   homolog) (ethylene-inducible protein HEVER).
 - Stellaria longipes probable pyridoxin biosynthesis H47 (PDX1 homolog).

These are  hydrophilic  proteins  of about 32 Kd. They can be picked up in the
database by  the  following pattern. We also developed a profile for the pdxS/
SNZ family.

-Consensus pattern: [LV]-P-[VI]-[VTPI]-[NQLHT]-[FL]-[ATVS]-[AS]-G-G-[LIV]-
                    [AT]-T-P-[AQS]-D-[AGVS]-[AS]-[LM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
