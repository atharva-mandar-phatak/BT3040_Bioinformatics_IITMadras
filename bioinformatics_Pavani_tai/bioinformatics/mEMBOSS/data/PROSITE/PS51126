*************************
* Dilute domain profile *
*************************

The  myosin  superfamily  consists of at least 15 distinct classes of presumed
actin-based  molecular  motors. All members of the superfamily share a similar
motor  domain  and  a  tail  portion which is diagnostic of the class [1].

Class  V  myosins are actin-based molecular motors that function in relatively
long-range  movements  of  many  intracellular  cargoes  including organelles,
membrane  vesicles,  and  mRNA [2]. These motors are ubiquitously found in all
eukaryotes.  Class  V myosins are characterised by the presence of a conserved
globular  domain at the C-terminus of the tail portion: the dilute domain [3].
Myosin  V  moves  via  attachment of its amino terminal head (motor) domain to
actin  cables;  its  carboxyl terminal dilute domain anchors it to cargoes via
attachments to organelle-specific receptors [2,4].

The  dilute  domain is also found in the afadin family. Afadins are nectin and
actin  filament-binding proteins that connect nectin to the actin cytoskeleton
[5].

The profile we developed covers the whole dilute domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
