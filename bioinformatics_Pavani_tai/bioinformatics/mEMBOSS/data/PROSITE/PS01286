* Coagulation factors 5/8 type C domain (FA58C) signatures and profile *
************************************************************************

Blood  coagulation  factors  V  and VIII contain a C-terminal, twice repeated,
domain of about 150 amino acids, which is called F5/8 type C, FA58C, or C1/C2-
like  domain.  A distant sequence similarity has been noted between the C1 /C2
domains  of  Factors  V  and VIII and the discoidin proteins, which comprise a
family of phospholipid-binding lectins and other proteins involved in adhesive
interactions [1].

In coagulation  factors  V  and  VIII the  repeated  domains compose part of a
larger functional  domain  which  promotes binding to anionic phospholipids on
the surface  of  platelets and endothelial cells [2]. The C-terminal domain of
the second   FA58C repeat (C2) of coagulation factor VIII has been shown to be
responsible for phosphatidylserine-binding and essential for activity [3,4].

The   crystal  structure  of  the  FA58C  domain  has  been  solved  [5]  (see
<PDB:1CZS>).  It exhibits a distorted jelly-roll beta-barrel motif, consisting
of  eight  antiparallel strands arranged in two beta-sheets. The lower part of
the  beta-barrel  is  characterized  by  a preponderance of basic residues and
three  adjacent  protruding  loops  that play a key role in lipid binding. The
galactose  binding  domain  of  fungal  galactose  oxidase exhibits structural
similarity to FA58C. The three adjacent loops are conserved and localized in a
region which has been predicted to anchor the enzyme to plant cell walls. This
may indicate a common binding role for the loop region.

Similar  domains  have  been  detected  in  other  extracellular  and membrane
proteins [6-8] which are listed below:

 - Mammalian  milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGM), which is expressed in milk
   and sperm.  It  is probably involved in phospholipid-binding. It contains 2
   EGF-like repeats followed by 2 copies of FA58C.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2   CUB domains (see <PDOC00908>, 2 FA58C domains and a MAM domain
   (see <PDOC00604>).
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed of 2 FA58C domains, a C-type lectin domain (see
   <PDOC00537>), 2 VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928>) and a CTCK (see <PDOC00912>).
 - Human  AEBP1,  a  transcriptional repressor  with carboxypeptidase activity
   that is  probably  involved  in  the  regulation  of the differentiation of
   osteoblasts. AEBP1  contains a single copy of FA58C. Mouse AEBP1 is shorter
   in its N-terminal and lacks part of the FA58C domain.
 - Bovine  Sco-spondin,  which  is  secreted  by  the  subcommissural organ in
   embryos and  is  involved  in  the  modulation  of neuronal aggregation. It
   contains at least 2 EGF-like domains, one FA58C, and 3 LDLRA domains.
 - Drosophila  neurexin  IV  which is required for septate junction and blood-
   nerve barrier  formation  and function. In comparision to neurexins I-alpha
   and III-alpha, which are composed of 6 LamG domains and 3 EGF-like repeats,
   the N-terminal LamG has been substituted by a FA58C domain in neurexin IV.
 - Mammalian  contactin  associated  proteins (CASPR), which are implicated in
   protein-protein interactions.
 - Mammalian  tyrosine-protein  kinase  receptors EDDR1 (CAK, DDR1, TRKE, etc)
   and NTRK3 (TKT or TYRO10) which all contain one copy of the FA58C domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative tyrosine-protein kinases G01D9.2, F11D5.3
   and C25F6.4.

FA58C contains  two  conserved  cysteines  in  most  proteins,  which link the
extremities of    the  domain  by a disulfide bond [9-11]. A further disulfide
bond is located near the C-terminal of the second FA58C domain in MFGM [11].

We  have  developed two patterns for FA58C. The first is located in the middle
of  the  domain  and  the  second  covers  the  C-terminal  extremity. We also
developed  a  profile that spans the whole domain. The profile also recognizes
fungal galactose oxidase and some bacterial hyaluronidase and sialidase, three
protein  families  that contain a conserved region related to the FA58C domain
[1].
