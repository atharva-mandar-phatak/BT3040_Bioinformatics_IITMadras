* Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes signature and profile *
*******************************************************

Ubiquitin-conjugating  enzymes  (EC 6.3.2.19)   (UBC  or  E2 enzymes)  [1,2,3]
catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins. An activated
ubiquitin moiety is transferred from an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) to E2
which later ligates ubiquitin  directly  to substrate proteins with or without
the assistance of 'N-end' recognizing proteins (E3).

In most species there are  many forms  of UBC  (at least 9 in yeast) which are
implicated in diverse cellular functions.

A cysteine residue is  required for ubiquitin-thiolester formation. There is a
single conserved  cysteine in UBC's and  the  region  around  that  residue is
conserved in the sequence of known UBC isozymes.   We have used that region as
a signature  pattern.  We  also  developed  a  profile that spans the complete
catalytical domain.

-Consensus pattern: [FYWLSP]-H-[PC]-[NHL]-[LIV]-x(3,4)-G-x-[LIVP]-C-[LIV]-
                    x(1,2)-[LIVR]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for yeast UBC6 (DOA2).
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
