**********************
* OAR domain profile *
**********************

This 14  amino  acid motif has been identified within the C-terminal region of
several Paired-like homeodomain (HD) (see <PDOC00027>) containing proteins [1,
2]. It  was  named  OAR  domain after the initials of otp, aristaless, and rax
[3].

Although it  has  been  proposed  that  this  domain  could  be  important for
transactivation and be involved in protein-protein interactions or DNA binding
[3, 4], its function is not yet known.

Some proteins known to contain an OAR domain are listed below:

 - Human  RIEG.  Defects  in this protein are the cause of Rieger syndrome, an
   autosomal dominant disorder that includes anomalies of the anterior chamber
   of the eye, dental hypoplasia and a protuberant umbilicus [1].
 - Mammalian OG12X. The function of these proteins is not yet known [2].
 - Vertebrate  Rax,  encoded  by  the retina and anterior neural fold homeobox
   gene. This protein plays a role in the proliferation and/or differentiation
   of retinal cell [3].
 - Drosophila  DRX.  It could be a homolog of vertebrate Rax. It appears to be
   important in brain development [5].
 - Human  SHOX, encoded by the short stature homeobox-containing gene. Defects
   or lack  of this protein are the cause of short stature associated with the
   Turner syndrome [4].
 - Mammalian  PITX3.  This  protein  appears  to  be  involved  in  normal eye
   anterior-chamber and lens development [6,7]. In human, defects in PITX3 are
   associated with   anterior   segment   mesenchymal  dysgenesis  (ASMD)  and
   autosomal-dominant congenital cataracts (ADCC) [7].
 - Vertebrate Pax3 and Pax7, transcription factors that play fundamental roles
   in the development of multi-cellular animals (Metazoa) [8].
 - Vertebrate visual system homeobox 2 (VSX2) [8].
 - Vertebrate dorsal root ganglia homeobox protein (DRG11) [8].

The OAR domain has also been called paired-type homeodomain tail (PHT), paired
tail or C-peptide domain [8].

The profile we developed covers the entire OAR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
