* Foamy virus protease (FV PR) domain profile *
***********************************************

Spumaviruses or  foamy  viruses (FVs) are a group of complex retroviruses that
have been  isolated  from  a  number  of animal species and are believed to be
apathogenic in  their  animal host [E1]. FVs express a pol-specific transcript
that codes  for  a Pol polyprotein that consists of the protease (PR), reverse
transcriptase, robonuclease  H  ,  and  the integrase domains. Retrovriral PRs
belong to  the family of aspartic proteases and are active as homodimers, with
the active   site   triplets   (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly;   D-T/S-G)  from  both  chain
contributing to the symetric active site of the enzyme. Transient FV PR domain
homodimers are  formed  under native condition but are only present as a minor
transient species,   which   is   not   detectable   by  traditional  methods.
Dimerization of  FV  RT  might  be  triggered  by additional viral or cellular
factors [1,2,3,4].  The  FV  PR  domain forms peptidase family A9 (spumapepsin
family) [E2].

The FV  PR  domain  consists  of  seven  beta-strands  and a helical turn (see
<pdb:2JYS>). The  beta-strands  form  a closed barrel-like beta-sheet with the
strand order  beta1-beta2-beta7-beta3-beta6-beta5-beta1. The strands beta1 and
beta7 are  arranged  in  parallel,  while all other strands are arranged in an
anti-parallel manner [3].

The profile we developed covers the entire FV PR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
