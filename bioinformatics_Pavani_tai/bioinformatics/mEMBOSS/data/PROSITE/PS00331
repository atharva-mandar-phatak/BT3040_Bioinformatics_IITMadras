* Malic enzymes signature *
***************************

Malic enzymes,    or    malate   oxidoreductases,   catalyze   the   oxidative
decarboxylation of  malate  into  pyruvate  important  for  a  wide  range  of
metabolic pathways. There are three related forms of malic enzyme [1,2,3]:

 - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.38), which uses preferentially NAD and
   has the  ability  to  decarboxylate  oxaloacetate  (OAA).  It  is  found in
   bacteria and insects.
 - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39), which uses preferentially NAD and
   is unable  to decarboxylate OAA. It is found in the mitochondrial matrix of
   plants and is a heterodimer of highly related subunits.
 - NADP-dependent  malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), which has a preference for NADP
   and has  the  ability  to  decarboxylate  OAA.  This form has been found in
   fungi, animals  and  plants.  In  mammals,  there  are  two  isozymes: one,
   mitochondrial and  the  other,  cytosolic.  Plants  also have two isozymes:
   chloroplastic and cytosolic.

There are  two  other proteins which are closely structurally related to malic
enzymes:

 - Escherichia coli protein sfcA, whose  function  is not yet known  but which
   could be an NAD or NADP-dependent malic enzyme.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKL029c, a probable malic enzyme.

There are  three  well  conserved regions in the enzyme sequences. Two of them
seem to be involved in binding NAD or NADP. The significance of the third one,
located in the central part of the enzymes, is not yet known. We selected this
region as a signature pattern for these enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [FM]-x-[DV]-D-x(2)-[GS]-T-[GSA]-x-[IV]-x-[LIVMAT]-[GAST]-
                    [GASTC]-[LIVMFA]-[LIVMFY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
