*********************************
* TatD deoxyribonuclease family *
*********************************

The Escherichia  coli  protein  tatD  is a cytoplasmic protein with magnesium-
dependent DNase  activity  [1].  It  is similar to a number of proteins in all
three kingdoms of life, among which:

 - Yeast chromosome II hypothetical protein YBL055c.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein ycfH and HI0454, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yjjV and HI0081, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yabD.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1664.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG009.

These are  proteins  of  from  24 to 47 Kd which contain a number of conserved
regions. They can be picked up in the database by the following patterns.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY](2)-D-[STA]-H-x-H-[LIVMFP]-[DN]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for yeast YBL055c and E.coli tatD.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 4.

-Consensus pattern: P-[LIVM]-x-[LIVM]-H-x-R-x-[TA]-x-[DE]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for H.influenzae HI1664 and M.genitalium MG009.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LVSAT]-[LIVA]-x(2)-[LIVMT]-[PSD]-x(3)-[LI]-[LIVMT]-
                    [LIVMST]-E-T-D-x-P
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
