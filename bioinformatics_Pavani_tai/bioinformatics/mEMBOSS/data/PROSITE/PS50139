* DRADA repeat profile *
************************

DRADA repeats   are   exclusively  present  in  the  double  stranded-specific
adenosine deaminase (DRADA) family. This enzyme deaminates multiple adenosines
to inosines  by a hydrolytic deamination reaction only on double-stranded RNA.
In mRNA,  inosine is read as guanosine by the translation apparatus, resulting
in codon  change  within  the  synthesized  protein.  DRADA,  among others, is
responsible for the editing of glutamate receptor mRNAs. This specific editing
alters the  gene-encoded  glutamine  (Q) to an arginine (R) located within the
channel-forming domain  of  the  glutamate  receptor  subunit.  The  result of
editing at  this  site, called the 'Q/R' site, is a profound alteration of the
Ca2+ permeability of the GLuR channel. The DRADA repeats are reiteration of an
around 70 amino acids module localized in a region important for the catalytic
activity. It  is  always  found  associated  with  the dsRBD domain [1,2] (see
<PDOC50137>).

In the human protein ADAR1 (DRADA), the N-terminal DRADA repeat has been shown
to bind  DNA  in  the  Z-conformation. As the C-terminal DRADA repeat does not
bind Z-DNA  as  a separate entity, it has been proposed that they act together
as a  single  bipartite  domain whose function could be to target ADAR1 to its
preferred substrates  by  binding  Z-DNA formed close to actively transcribing
genes [3].
