* L27 domain profile *
**********************

The L27  domain  is a ~50-amino acid module, initially identified in the Lin-2
and Lin-7  proteins, that exists in a large family of animal scaffold proteins
[1]. The  L27  domain is a specific protein-protein interaction module capable
of forming heteromeric complexes that can integrate multiple scaffold proteins
into supramolecular  assemblies  required for establishment and maintenance of
cell polarity.  The  L27  domain  can  be found as a single occurrence or as a
duplication in  association  with other domains such as PDZ (see <PDOC50106>),
SH3 (see  <PDOC50002>),  the  guanylate kinase domain (see <PDOC00670>) or the
serine/threonine protein kinase domain (see <PDOC00100>).

The main  features of the L27 domain are conserved negatively charged residues
and a  conserved  aromatic  amino  acid  [1].  Study of individual L27 domains
revealed largely  unfolded  domains  that  require  the  formation of obligate
heterodimers to achieve well-folded structures. Each L27 domain is composed of
three helices.  The  two  L27  domains  heterodimerize  by  building a compact
structure consisting of a four-helix bundle formed by the first two helices of
each L27  domain  and one coiled-coil formed by the third helix of each domain
(see <PDB:1RSO>) [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a L27 domain are listed below:

 - Members of a subset of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs).
 - Lin-7-like proteins.

The profile we developed covers the entire L27 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
