* Clathrin adaptor complexes medium chain signatures *
******************************************************

Clathrin coated  vesicles (CCV) mediate intracellular membrane traffic such as
receptor mediated  endocytosis.  In addition to clathrin, the CCV are composed
of a number of other components including oligomeric complexes which are known
as adaptor  or  clathrin  assembly  proteins  (AP)  complexes [1]. The adaptor
complexes are  believed  to  interact  with  the cytoplasmic tails of membrane
proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. In mammals two type of
adaptor complexes  are  known: AP-1 which is associated with the Golgi complex
and AP-2  which is associated with the plasma membrane. Both AP-1 and AP-2 are
heterotetramers that  consist  of two large chains - the adaptins - (gamma and
beta' in  AP-1; alpha and beta in AP-2); a medium chain (AP47 in AP-1; AP50 in
AP-2) and a small chain (AP19 in AP-1; AP17 in AP-2).

The medium chains  of AP-1 and AP-2 are evolutionary related proteins of about
50 Kd.  Homologs  of  AP47  and  AP50  have  also been found in Caenorhabditis
elegans (genes unc-101 and ap50) [2] and yeast (gene APM1 or YAP54) [3].

Some more divergent, but  clearly evolutionary related proteins have also been
found in yeast: APM2 and YBR288c.

As signature   patterns, we selected two conserved regions, one located in the
N-terminal region, the other from the central section of these proteins.
