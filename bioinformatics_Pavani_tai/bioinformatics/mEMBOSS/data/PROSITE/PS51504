* Linker histone H1/H5 globular (H15) domain profile *
******************************************************

Histone proteins  have  central  roles  in  both  chromatin  organization  (as
structural units of the nucleosome) and gene regulation (as dynamic components
that have  a  direct  impact on DNA transcription and replication). Eukaryotic
DNA wraps  around  a  histone octamer to form a nucleosome, the first order of
compaction of  eukaryotic chromatin. The core histone octamer is composed of a
central H3-H4  tetramer  and  two  flanking  H2A-H2B  dimers. Each of the core
histone contains  a  common  structural  motif, called the histone fold, which
facilitates the   interactions   between  the  individual  core  histones.  In
addition to the core histones, there is a "linker histone" called H1 (or H5 in
avian species).  The  linker  histones present in all multicellular eukaryotes
are the  most divergent group of histones, with numerous cell type- and stage-
specific variant.  The  linker histones, which do not contain the histone fold
motif, are  critical to the higher-order compaction of chromatin, because they
bind to  internucleosomal  DNA  and facilitate interactions between individual
nucleosomes. In  addition,  H1  variants have been shown to be involved in the
regulation of  developmental genes. A common feature of this protein family is
a tripartite  structure  in  which  a  globular (H15) domain of about 80 amino
acids is  flanked  by  two  less  structured  N- and C-terminal tails. The H15
domain is  also  characterized  by  high sequence homology among the family of
linker histones.  The highly conserved H15 domain is essential for the binding
of H1  or  H5  to the nucleosome. It consists of a three helix bundle (I-III),
with a  beta-hairpin  at  the  C-terminus. There is also a short three-residue
stretch between  helices  I  and  II  that is in the beta-strand conformation.
Together with  the C-terminal beta-hairpin, this strand forms the third strand
of an antiparallel beta-sheet (see <PDB:1HST>) [1,2,3,4,E1].

Some proteins known to contain a H15 domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic  histone  H1.  The  histones  H1  constitute  a family with many
   variants, differing  in  their affinity for chromatin. Several variants are
   simultaneously present  in  a  single  cell.  For  example,  the  nucleated
   erythrocytes of  birds  contain both H1 and H5, the latter being an extreme
   variant of H1.
 - Eukaryotic    MHYST    family   of   histone   acetyltransferase.   Histone
   acetyltransferases transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the epsylon-
   amino group  of lysine within the basic NH2-termini of histones, which bind
   the acidic phosphates of DNA [5].

The profile we developed covers the entire H15 domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
