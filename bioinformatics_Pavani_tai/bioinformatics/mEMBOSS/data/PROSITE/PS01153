**********************************
* NOL1/NOP2/sun family signature *
**********************************

The following proteins seems to be evolutionary related:

 - Mammalian proliferating-cell nucleolar antigen p120  (gene NOL1)  which may
   play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle and the increased nucleolar
   activity that is associated with the cell proliferation.
 - Yeast nucleolar protein NOP2 (or YNA1) which could be involved in nucleolar
   function during  the  onset  of growth, and in the maintenance of nucleolar
   structure.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBL024w.
 - Bacterial protein sun (also known as fmu).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yebU.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY21B4.24.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0026.

NOL1 is  a  protein of 855 residues, NOP2 consists of 618 residues, YBL024w of
684, sun is a protein of about 430 to 450 residues and MJ026 has 274 residues.
They share  a  conserved  central domain  which contains some highly conserved
regions. We have selected one these regions as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [FV]-[DQ]-[KRA]-[LIVMA]-L-x-D-[AV]-P-C-[ST]-[GA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
