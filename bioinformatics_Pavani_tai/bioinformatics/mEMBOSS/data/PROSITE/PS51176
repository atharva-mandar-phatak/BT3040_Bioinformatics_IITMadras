* Prephenate/arogenate dehydrogenase domain profile *
*****************************************************

Dehydrogenases  for  the  biosynthesis of L-tyrosine (Tyr) comprise prephenate
dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.12) (PDH), arogenate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.43) (ADH)
and   cyclohexadienyl  dehydrogenase  that  can  accept  both  prephenate  and
arogenate  as  substrate.  These  enzymes  use  a  nicotinamide  nucleotide as
co-substrate and can be specific for NAD(+), for NADP(+) or can utilize either
of  these.  Bacteria,  archaea,  plants and fungi possess one or more of these
enzymes,  which  participate  in two alternative pathways for the synthesis of
Tyr. Prephenate, the common precursor, is formed from chorismate by chorismate
mutase.  PDH converts prephenate into p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which can yield
Tyr  according  to  pathway  I.  In  the  alternative  pathway  II, prephenate
aminotransferase  converts  prephenate into arogenate (meaning 'giving rise to
aromatics').  Conversion  of  arogenate  can  either  yield  Tyr  by  ADH,  or
phenylalanine (Phe) by arogenate dehydratase.

PDH in Tyr biosynthesis pathway I:

                 PDH                              Tyr aminotransferase
prephenate   ---------->   p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate    <==========>    tyrosine

ADH in Tyr biosynthesis pathway II:

          Prephenate aminotransferase                   ADH
prephenate   <===================>   arogenate   ----------------->   tyrosine

Both  PDH  and  ADH  contain a catalytic PDH/ADH domain, which has a length of
~180  residues.  A potential NAD(+) binding motif is located in the N-terminal
part  [1,2].  A  central  conserved  histidine  is important for the catalytic
activity  in the Escherichia coli PDH [3]. Some PDH/ADH domain proteins have a
C-terminal extension that may be involved in allosteric regulation [1-4].

Some proteins known to contain a prephenate/arogenate dehydrogenase domain:

 - Bacterial  T-protein encoded by the tyrA gene, a bifunctional enzyme of two
   catalytic   domains,  chorismate  mutase  (see  <PDOC51167>)  and  PDH  for
   biosynthesis  of  tyrosine  (Tyr).  Both  enzyme  activities  are  feedback
   inhibited  by  Tyr. This 'PDH' is NAD(+) specific and can utilize arogenate
   in vitro, thus technically it is a cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase.
 - Cyanobacterial  arogenate  dehydrogenase,  which  seems  to be specific for
   NADP(+) and feedback inhibited by Tyr [2].
 - Zymomonas  mobilis  tyrC,  an NAD(+)-specific cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase
   that can function as a PDH and as ADH, without feedback inhibition by Tyr.
 - Yeast   prephenate   dehydrogenase,   an  NADP(+)  specific  PDH  which  is
   transcriptionally regulated by Phe.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  arogenate  dehydrogenases TyrAAT1 and TyrAAT2, which
   are  monofunctional  ADH  specific  for  NADP(+),  with strong Tyr feedback
   regulation. In  plants,  the arogenate pathway seems to be the dominant, or
   only, pathway for synthesis of both Phe and Tyr [2,4].

The  profile we developed covers the entire prephenate/arogenate dehydrogenase
domain.
