* BEN domain profile *
**********************

The BEN  domain  is  an  alpha-helical module found in diverse animal proteins
such as  BANP/SMAR1,  NAC1  and  the  Drosophila  mod(mdg4)  isoform C, in the
chordopoxvirus virosomal    protein   E5R   and   in   several   proteins   of
polydnaviruses. The  BEN  domain  is  present  in  one or more copies in these
proteins and  has been named after experimentally characterized proteins BANP,
E5R and  NAC1 in which it is present. The BEN domain is predicted to functions
as an  adaptor  for the higher-order structuring of chromatin, and recruitment
of chromatin  modifying  factors  in  transcriptional  regulation. It has been
suggested that   the  BEN  domain  mediates  protein-DNA  and  protein-protein
interactions during  chromatin organization and transcription. The presence of
BEN domains in a poxviral early virosomal protein and in polydnaviral proteins
also suggests  a  possible  role  for them in organization of viral DNA during
replication or  transcription.  BEN domains are linked in polypetides to other
globular domains  with  functions  related  to  transcriptional regulation and
chromatin structure,  such  as BTB (see <PDOC50097>), C4DM, C2H2 fingers, MCAF
N-terminal domain  (MCAFN)  and  a domain that is also found N-terminal to the
SAM domain  in  sex comb on midleg-like 1 (SCML1), a protein of the vertebrate
polycomb complex [1].

The BEN  domain  is  predicted  to  have an all-alpha fold with four conserved
helices. Its conservation pattern revealed several conserved residues, most of
which have  hydrophobic  side-chains  and  are  likely  to  stabilize the fold
through helix-helix packing [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire BEN domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
