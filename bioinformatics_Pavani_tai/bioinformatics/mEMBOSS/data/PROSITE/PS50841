* DIX domain profile *
**********************

Proteins of  the  dishevelled  family  (Dsh  and  Dvl)  play a key role in the
transduction of  the  Wg/Wnt signal (see <PDOC00219>) from the cell surface to
the nucleus:  in  response  to Wnt signal, they block the degradation of beta-
catenin by  interacting  with  the scaffolding protein axin. The N-terminus of
proteins of  the dishevelled family and the C-terminus of proteins of the axin
family share  a  region  of  homology  of about 85 amino acids, which has been
called DIX  for  DIshevelled  and aXin [1]. The DIX domain is found associated
with PDZ  (see  <PDOC50106>)  and DEP (see <PDOC50186>) domains in proteins of
the dishevelled family and with an RGS domain (see <PDOC50132>) in proteins of
the axin    family.    DIX  has been shown to be a protein-protein interaction
domain that  is  important for homo- and hetero-oligomerization of proteins of
the dishevelled  and axin families [2,3,4,5]. The DIX domain has also be shown
to be  a signalling module that can target proteins to actin stress fibres and
cytoplasmic vesicles to control Wnt signalling [6,7].

The Dvl2  DIX  domain has been shown to form a predominantly helical structure
[6].

The profile we developed covers the entire DIX domain.
