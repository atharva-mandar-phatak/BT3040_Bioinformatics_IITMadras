******************************************
* EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
******************************************

A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
proliferation.

A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation of the EGF-like domain:

The region between the 5th and 6th cysteine contains two conserved glycines of
which at  least  one  is  present  in  most  EGF-like  domains. We created two
patterns for  this  domain,  each  including one of these C-terminal conserved
glycine residues. The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-C-x(2)-{V}-x(2)-G-{C}-x-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
 but not  those  that  have very long or very short regions between the last 3
 conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s).
-Other sequence(s)  detected  in  Swiss-Prot:  87 proteins, of which 27 can be
 considered as possible candidates.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-C-x(2)-[GP]-[FYW]-x(4,8)-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
 but not  those  that  have very long or very short regions between the last 3
 conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s).
-Other sequence(s)  detected  in  Swiss-Prot:  83 proteins, of which 49 can be
 considered as possible candidates.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The  beta chain of the integrin family of proteins contains 2 cysteine-
 rich repeats  which were said to be dissimilar with the EGF pattern [7].
-Note: Laminin  EGF-like repeats (see <PDOC00961>) are longer than the average
 EGF module  and  contain  a further disulfide bond C-terminal of the EGF-like
 region. Perlecan  and  agrin  contain  both EGF-like domains and laminin-type
 EGF-like domains.
-Note: The  pattern do not detect all of the repeats of proteins with multiple
 EGF-like repeats.
-Note: See <PDOC00913> for an entry describing specifically the subset of EGF-
 like domains that bind calcium.
