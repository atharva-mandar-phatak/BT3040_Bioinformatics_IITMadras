* CRIC domain profile *
***********************

The multidomain  protein  Connector  enhancer  of  kinase  suppressor  of  ras
(Connector enhancer  of  KSR)  (CNK) functions as a scaffold in several signal
cascades and   acts  on  proliferation,  differenciation  and  apoptosis.  CNK
connects upstream  activators and downstream targets of Ras- and Rho-dependent
signaling pathways  and  may  allow  cross-talks  between  these  pathways. In
invertebrates, CNK  is  expressed  as  one  isoform,  whereas in mammals there
exists CNK1,  CNK2A, and its splice variant CNK2B. CNK proteins consist of one
sterile alpha  motif  (SAM)  domain (see <PDOC50105>), one conserved region in
CNK (CRIC)  domain,  one PSD-96/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain (see <PDOC50106>), and
one pleckstrin  homology  (PH)  domain  (see  <PDOC50003>). The CRIC domain is
enriched in  leucine  residues  and functions as a protein-protein interaction
domain [1,2].

The profile we developed covers the entire CRIC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
