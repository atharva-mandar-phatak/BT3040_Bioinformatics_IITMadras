* KRAB-related domain profile *
*******************************

This domain  of  about  63  amino  acid residues is related to the KRAB domain
(see <PDOC50805>  and  has  been identified in the N-terminal ends of proteins
belonging to the SSX family [1,2,3]. Proteins of the SSX family lack the C2H2-
type zinc  finger  (see  <PDOC00028>)  which  is  invariably found in proteins
containing the KRAB domain. The KRAB-related domains show greatest homology to
the KRAB  A  subdomain  and contain a high proportion of the amino acids which
are usually  conserved  between  the KRAB A subdomains of zinc finger proteins
[1].

Although the   KRAB-related  domains  of  SSX1  and  SSX2  contribute  to  the
repressive activity  of  these  proteins, transcriptional repression is mainly
mediated by  a  region  located  in  their  C-terminus. Hence, unlike the KRAB
domain, the  KRAB-related  domain  is  only  a weak transcriptional repression
domain. In  addition  the  KRAB-related  domain is unable to interact with the
KAP-1/TIF1-beta protein which  appears  to function as a universal corepressor
for KRAB domain proteins [4].

Translocations which  result  in  the  fusion of the SYT gene to either of the
closely related  SSX1 or SSX2 genes are associated with synovial sarcomas [1].
The resulting  SYT-SSX1/SSX2  proteins  analyzed  so far lack the KRAB-related
domain and act as activators of transcription [4].

The profile we developed spans the complete KRAB-related domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
