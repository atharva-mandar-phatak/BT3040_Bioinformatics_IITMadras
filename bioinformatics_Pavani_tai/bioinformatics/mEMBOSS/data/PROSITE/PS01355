* Short hematopoietin receptor family 1 signature *
***************************************************

A number  of  receptors  for  lymphokines,  hematopoietic  growth  factors and
growth hormone-related  molecules  have  been  found to share a common binding
domain. These  receptors  are  designated as hematopoietin receptors [1,2] and
the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been
subdivided into  two  major  structural  groups:  Large/long  and  small/short
hematopoietins.

One subset  of  individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes
for small   hematopoietins   are   structurally   related   such   that  their
extracellular parts   strictly   contain  the  200  amino-acids  hematopoietin
domain (duplicated  in  IL-3/-5/GM-CSF  beta  chain  receptors  KH97/AIC2B and
AIC2A). They define a structural subgroup containing the following chains:

 - Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL2RB)
 - Interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG)
 - Interleukin-3 receptor beta chain (AIC2A)
 - Interleukin-3/-5/GM-CSF receptor common beta chain (KH97/AIC2B)
 - Interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL4RA)
 - Interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA)
 - Interleukin-9 receptor alpha chain (IL9RA)

A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:

   | |       |  |                      Transmembrane
   +-+       +--+

IL4RA, IL7RA  and  IL9RA  are  specific  alpha  chain receptors for IL-4, IL-7
and IL-9  respectively,  whereas  IL2RB is common to IL-2 and IL-15 (IL2RA and
IL15RA are  not  members  of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily). IL2RG is
part of  IL-2,  IL-15,  IL-7,  IL-9  and  IL-4  form I receptor complexes [3].
KH97/AIC2B chain  is  part  of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptor complexes and in
the mouse,  AIC2B  can  be  substituted  by AIC2A, an IL-3 specific beta chain
receptor [4].  Together  with  either  IL13RA1  or IL13RA2, IL4RA is also part
of the  IL-13  receptor  complex  for  which IL-4 can compete with IL-13 (IL-4
receptor complex form II) [5].

We have  used  one  pattern  to detect this subfamily. The motif is located at
the carboxy-terminal part of the 200 amino acid hematopoietin domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVF]-x(9)-[LIV]-[RK]-x(9,20)-W-S-x-W-S-x(4)-[FYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: the leptin receptors.
