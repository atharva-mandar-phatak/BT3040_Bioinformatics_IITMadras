********************************
* Hemerythrin family signature *
********************************

Marine invertebrates such  as annelids or sipunculans  possess  two completely
different types of oxygen binding  proteins: globins  which  are  found in the
blood and hemerythrins which are found in the vascular system and the coelemic
fluid or in muscles (myohemerythrins).  Hemerythrins and myohemerythrins [1,2]
are small proteins of about 110 to 129 amino acid residues that bind two  iron
atoms. Five  histidines, one glutamic acid  and one aspartic acid are involved
in the binding of the iron atoms.

Ovohemerythrin [3], a yolk protein  from the leech Theromyzon tessulatum seems
to belong to this family of proteins, it may play a role in the detoxification
of free iron after a blood meal.

A number  of  uncharacterized bacterial and archaeal proteins are evolutionary
related to hemerythrins.

As a signature pattern we selected a region, located in the central section of
these proteins  and  that  contains four of the iron-ligands: three histidines
and a glutamate or glutamine.

-Consensus pattern: H-F-x(2)-[EQ]-[ENQ]-x(2)-[LMF]-x(4,7)-[FY]-x(5,6)-H-x(3)-
                    [HR]
                    [The 3 H's and the first E/Q are iron ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
