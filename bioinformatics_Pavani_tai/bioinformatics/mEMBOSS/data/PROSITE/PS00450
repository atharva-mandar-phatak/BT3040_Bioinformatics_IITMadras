* Aconitase family signatures *
*******************************

Aconitase  (aconitate hydratase)  (EC  4.2.1.3) [1]  is  the enzyme  from  the
tricarboxylic  acid  cycle  that  catalyzes  the  reversible  isomerization of
citrate and isocitrate.  Cis-aconitate  is  formed  as an intermediary product
during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two isozymes of aconitase are
known to exist: one found in  the mitochondrial  matrix and the other found in
the cytoplasm. Aconitase, in its active form,  contains  a 4Fe-4S  iron-sulfur
cluster; three  cysteine  residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S
cluster.

It has  been  shown  that  the  aconitase  family  also contains the following
proteins:

 - Iron-responsive  element binding  protein (IRE-BP).  IRE-BP  is a cytosolic
   protein that binds  to iron-responsive elements (IREs).  IREs are stem-loop
   structures found in  the 5'UTR of ferritin,  and  delta aminolevulinic acid
   synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of  transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also
   express aconitase activity.
 - 3-isopropylmalate  dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.33)  (isopropylmalate  isomerase),
   the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine.
 - Homoaconitase  (EC  4.2.1.36)  (homoaconitate  hydratase),  an  enzyme that
   participates in  the  alpha-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and
   that converts cis-homoaconitate into homoisocitric acid.
 - Esherichia coli protein ybhJ.

As a  signature  for  proteins  from the aconitase family we have selected two
conserved regions  that  contain  the  three  cysteine  ligands  of the 4Fe-4S
cluster.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x(2)-[GSACIVM]-x-[LIV]-[GTIV]-[STP]-C-x(0,1)-T-N-
                    [GSTANI]-x(4)-[LIVMA]
                    [C binds the iron-sulfur center]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ybhJ.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(2)-[LIVWPQT]-x(3)-[GACST]-C-[GSTAM]-[LIMPTA]-C-[LIMV]-
                    [GA]
                    [The 2 C's bind the iron-sulfur center]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for ybhJ.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
