* PTR2 family proton/oligopeptide symporters signatures *
*********************************************************

A family  of  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  proteins  that  seem  to be mainly
involved in  the  intake  of  small  peptides with the concomitant uptake of a
proton has  been  recently  characterized  [1,2]. Proteins that belong to this
family are:

 - Fungal peptide transporter PTR2.
 - Mammalian intestine proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter PeptT1.
 - Mammalian kidney proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter PeptT2.
 - Drosophila opt1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana  peptide transporters PTR2-A and PTR2-B (also known as
   the histidine transporting protein NTR1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana proton-dependent nitrate/chlorate transporter CHL1.
 - Lactococcus proton-dependent di- and tri-peptide transporter dtpT.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C06G8.2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F56F4.5.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K04E7.2.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybgH.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydgR.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhiP.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjdL.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yclF.

These integral   membrane   proteins   are   predicted   to   comprise  twelve
transmembrane regions.  As  signature  patterns,  we  selected two of the best
conserved regions. The first is a region that includes the end of  the  second
transmembrane  region,  a cytoplasmic  loop as well as the third transmembrane
region.  The second pattern corresponds to the core of the fifth transmembrane
region.
