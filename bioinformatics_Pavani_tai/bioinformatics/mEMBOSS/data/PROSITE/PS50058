* G-protein gamma subunit profile *
***********************************

Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) [1] act as intermediaries  in
the transduction  of  signals generated by transmembrane receptors. G proteins
consist of three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). The alpha subunit binds to
and hydrolyzes  GTP;  the  functions  of  the beta and gamma subunits are less
clear but  they  seem to be required for the replacement of GDP by GTP as well
as for membrane anchoring and receptor recognition.

The gamma  subunits  are  small  proteins  (from  70 to 110 residues) that are
bound to  the  membrane via a isoprenyl group (either a farnesyl or a geranyl-
geranyl) covalently  linked to their C-terminus. In mammals there are at least
12 different isoforms of gamma subunits.

The Caenorhabditis  elegans  protein egl-10, which is a regulator of G-protein
signalling, contains a G-protein gamma-like domain.

We have  developed  a  profile  that  spans  the  complete length of the gamma
subunit.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 for yeast and squid G-protein gamma.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
