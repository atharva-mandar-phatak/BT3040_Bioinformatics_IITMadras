* FYR domain FYRN and FYRC motif profiles *
*******************************************

The FYRN  and FYRC sequence motifs are two poorly characterized phenylalanine/
tyrosine-rich regions of around 50 and 100 amino acids, respectively, that are
found in  a  variety  of  chromatin-associated  proteins  [1,2,3,4].  They are
particularly common  in  histone  H3K4  methyltransferases  most  notably in a
family of  proteins  that  includes human mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and the
Drosophila melanogaster  protein  trithorax.  Both of these enzymes play a key
role in  the  epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development, and
the gene  coding  for  MLL  is  frequently  rearranged in infant and secondary
therapy-related acute  leukemias.  They  are also found in transforming growth
factor beta  regulator 1 (TBRG1), a growth inhibitory protein induced in cells
undergoing arrest  in  response  to  DNA damage and transforming growth factor
(TGF)-beta1. As  TBRG1  has  been  shown  to bind to both the tumor suppressor
p14ARF and  MDM2,  a  key  regulator  of  p53,  it  is  also  known as nuclear
interactor of ARF and MDM2 (NIAM). In most proteins, the FYRN and FYRC regions
are closely  juxtaposed,  however,  in  MLL  and  its  homologues they are far
distant. To  be  fully  active,  MLL  must  be  proteolytically  processed  by
taspase1, which cleaves the protein between the FYRN and FYRC regions [5]. The
N-terminal and   C-terminal  fragments  remain  associated  after  proteolysis
apparently as  a  result  of an interaction between the FYRN and FYRC regions.
How proteolytic  processing  regulates  the  activity  of  MLL  is  not known.
Intriguingly, the  FYRN  and  FYRC  motifs  of a second family of histone H3K4
methyltransferases, represented  by  MLL2  and  MLL4  in  humans  and  TRR  in
Drosophila melanogaster,  are  closely  juxtaposed.  FYRN  and FYRC motifs are
found in   association   with   modules   that  create  or  recognize  histone
modifications in  proteins  from  a wide range of eukaryotes, and it is likely
that in  these  proteins  they have a conserved role related to some aspect of
chromatin biology [4].

The FYRN  and  FYRC regions are not separate independently folded domains, but
are components  of  a  distinct  protein module, The FYRN and FYRC motifs both
form part  of  a single folded module (the FYR domain), which adopts an alpha+
beta fold  consisting  of  a  six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet followed by
four consecutive  alpha-helices  (see <PDB:2WZO>). The FYRN region corresponds
to beta-strands 1–4 and their connecting loops, whereas the FYRC motif maps to
beta-strand 5,  beta-strand  6  and  helices  alpha1  to  alpha4.  Most of the
conserved tyrosine  and  phenylalanine  residues, after which these motifs are
named are  involved  in interactions that stabilize the fold. Proteins such as
MLL, in  which  the  FYRN  and FYRC regions are separated by hundreds of amino
acids, are  expected to contain FYR domains with a large insertion between two
of the strands of the beta-sheet (strands 4 and 5) [4].

The profiles we developed cover the entire FYRN and FYRC motifs.
