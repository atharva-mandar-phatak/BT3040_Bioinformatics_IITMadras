* Nuclear hormone receptors DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

Nuclear  hormone  receptors  are  ligand-activated  transcription factors that
regulate  gene  expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences upstream
of  their  target  genes.  In  vertebrates,  these  proteins  regulate diverse
biological  processes  such as pattern formation, cellular differentiation and
homeostasis [1 to 6].

Classical nuclear hormone receptors contain two conserved regions, the hormone
binding  domain and a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that is composed of two C4-type
zinc  fingers.  The  DBD  is  responsible for targeting the receptors to their
hormone  response  elements  (HRE).  It  binds  as  a  dimer with each monomer
recognizing  a  six  base  pair  sequence of DNA. The vast majority of targets
contain  the  same  5'-AGGTCA-3'  consensus sequence [7]. In some cases a less
conserved  C-terminal  extension  of  the core DBD confers the DNA selectivity
[8].

The  two zinc fingers fold to form a single structural domain (see <PDB:1HCQ>)
[9,10].  The  structure consists of two helices perpendicular to each other. A
zinc ion, coordinated by four conserved cysteines, holds the base of a loop at
the  N  terminus  of  each  helix.  The  helix  of each monomer makes sequence
specific contacts in the major groove of the DNA.

Proteins  known  to  contain a nuclear hormone receptor DNA-binding domain are
listed below:

 - Androgen receptor (AR).
 - Estrogen receptor (ER).
 - Glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
 - Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).
 - Progesterone receptor (PR).
 - Retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs).
 - Thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha and beta.
 - The  avian  erythroblastosis virus oncogene v-erbA, derived from a cellular
   thyroid hormone receptor.
 - Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR).
 - Insects ecdysone receptor (EcR).
 - COUP transcription  factor  (also  known  as  ear-3),  and  its  Drosophila
   homolog seven-up (svp).
 - Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), which binds  to DNA sites required for
   the transcription of the genes for alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein CIII
   and transthyretin.
 - Ad4BP, a protein that binds to the Ad4 site found in the promoter region of
   steroidogenic P450 genes.
 - Apolipoprotein   AI   regulatory   protein-1   (ARP-1),  required  for  the
   transcription of apolipoprotein AI.
 - Peroxisome  proliferator  activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors
   specifically activated   by  peroxisome  proliferators.  They  control  the
   peroxisomal beta-oxidation  pathway  of  fatty acids by activating the gene
   for acyl-CoA oxidase.
 - Drosophila  protein  knirps  (kni),  a  zygotic  gap  protein  required for
   abdominal segmentation of the Drosophila embryo.
 - Drosophila protein  ultraspiracle (usp) (or chorion factor 1),  which binds
   to the promoter region of s15 chorion gene.
 - Human estrogen receptor related genes 1 and 2 (err1 and err2).
 - Human erbA related gene 2 (ear-2).
 - Mammalian NGFI-B (NAK1, nur/77, N10).
 - Mammalian NOT/nurR1/RNR-1.
 - Drosophila protein embryonic gonad (egon).
 - Drosophila knirps-related protein (knrl).
 - Drosophila protein tailless (tll).
 - Drosophila 20-oh-ecdysone regulated protein E75.
 - Insects Hr3.
 - Insects Hr38.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans cnr-8, cnr-14, and odr-7
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins B0280.8, EO2H1.7 and K06A1.4.

As a signature pattern for this family of proteins, we took the most conserved
residues, the first 27, of the DNA-binding domain. We also developed a profile
that spans the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x(1,2)-[DENAVSPHKQT]-x(5,6)-[HNY]-[FY]-x(4)-C-
                    x(2)-C-x(2)-F(2)-x-R
                    [The 4 C's are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
