* KaiA N- and C-terminal domain profiles *
******************************************

Cyanobacteria are  the  most  primitive  organisms  known to exhibit circadian
rhythms. KaiA,  kaiB and kaiC (see <PDOC51146>) constitute the circadian clock
machinery in  cyanobacteria,  and kaiA activates kaiBC expression whereas kaiC
represses it  [1].  Apparent  homologues  of  kaiB  and  kaiC  are found among
noncyanobacterial eubacteria  and  the  archaea. However kaiA appears confined
within the  cyanobacteria,  which  are  the only prokaryotes with demonstrated
circadian rhythms [2].

There are  at  least  two types of kaiA proteins: long and short [2]. The long
versions consist  of  ~300  aminoacyl  residues.  There  is  limited  sequence
conservation in  the  amino-terminal 200 residues of these proteins but a high
degree of conservation in the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues. They thus appear
to contain  two  independently folded domains, the amino and carboxyl regions,
connected by   a   canonical   linker.  The  short  versions  are  essentially
independent carboxyl-terminal domains.

The kaiA  N-terminal  domain  consists  of  a  central five-stranded (beta1 to
beta5) parallel  beta-sheet  flanked  by  two groups of alpha-helices (alpha1,
alpha4 and  alpha2,  alpha3)  packed  on  either side of the beta-sheet and an
additional alpha  helix  (alpha5) lying near the amino terminus of the central
beta-strand (see  <PDB:1R8J>) [2,3]. The structure of the N-terminal domain of
kaiA is  that of a pseudo-receiver domain, similar to those found in bacterial
response regulators.  Although the fold is that of a canonical receiver domain
(see <PDOC50110>),  the  primary  sequence  is  dissimilar,  and  it lacks the
conserved aspartate  residue  necessary  for  phosphorylation. KaiA activation
most likely  involves  direct  protein-protein  interactions of the N-terminal
domain that result in functional modulation of the C-terminal effector domain.
The C-terminal kaiA domain is reponsible for dimer formation, binding to kaiC,
enhancing kaiC  phosphorylation  and generating the circadian oscillations. It
adopts a  novel  all  alpha-helical  homodimeric  structure  (see  <PDB:1Q6A>)
[1,3,4,5]. The  kaiA  C-terminal  domain  contains two parallel helix-hairpin-
helix motifs  that  form  a  four helix bundle, which represents a new protein
folding motif.

The profiles we developed cover the entire kaiA N- and C-terminal domains.
