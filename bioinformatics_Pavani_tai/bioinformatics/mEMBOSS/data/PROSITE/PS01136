* Uncharacterized protein family UPF0034 signature *
****************************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1] to share regions of
similarities:

 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yhdG and HI0979, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yjbN and HI0634, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yohI and HI0270, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yacF.
 - Rhodobacter  capsulatus  protein nifR3 and related proteins in Azospirillum
   brasilense and Rhizobium leguminosarum.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0644.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein sll0926.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C45G9.2.
 - Yeast protein SMM1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YLR401c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YLR405w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YML080w.

Although it  has  been  proposed  [2]  that  Rhodobacter capsulatus nifR3 is a
transcriptional regulatory  protein, we believe that these proteins constitute
a family of enzymes whose active site could include a conserved cysteine which
we have used as the central part of a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[DNG]-[LIVMF]-N-x-G-C-[PS]-x(3,4)-[LIVMASQ]-x(5,6)-
                    G-[SACY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for a Azotobacter vinelandii yohI ortholog.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
