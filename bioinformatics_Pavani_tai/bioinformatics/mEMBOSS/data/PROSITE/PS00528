* Ribosomal protein S4e signature *
***********************************

A number of eukaryotic  and  archaebacterial ribosomal proteins can be grouped
on the basis of sequence similarities. One of these families consists of:

 - Mammalian S4 [1].  Two  highly similar isoforms of this protein exist : one
   coded by a gene on chromosome Y, and the other on chromosome X.
 - Plant cytoplasmic S4 [2]
 - Yeast S7 (YS6).
 - Archebacterial S4e.

These proteins  have  233  to  264  amino  acids.  As  a signature pattern, we
selected a  highly  conserved  stretch  of  15  residues  in  their N-terminal
section. Four positions in this region are positively charged residues.

-Consensus pattern: H-x-K-R-[LIVMF]-[SANK]-x-P-x(2)-[WY]-x-[LIVM]-x-[KRP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
