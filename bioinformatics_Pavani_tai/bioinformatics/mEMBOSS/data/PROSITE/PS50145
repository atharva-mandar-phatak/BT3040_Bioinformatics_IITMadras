*********************************
* Zinc finger TRAF-type profile *
*********************************

TRAF  proteins  were  isolated  first  by  their  ability to interact with TNF
receptor  [1].  They are involved in different cytoplasmic signal transduction
pathways.  TRAF  proteins  are composed of 3 structural domains: a RING finger
(see  <PDOC00449>) in the N terminal part of the protein, TRAF zinc fingers in
the  middle part and the TRAF domain in the C terminal part. TRAF zinc fingers
contain  8  possible  ligands  for one or two zinc atoms. This domain is found
only in TRAF and TRAF-related proteins and its function is not yet known.

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: January 2002 / First entry.
