Xeroderma  pigmentosum (XP) [1]  is a  human   autosomal   recessive  disease,
characterized by  a  high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer.  People's
skin cells  with this condition  are hypersensitive  to ultraviolet light, due
to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair. There are a minimum of
seven genetic complementation  groups  involved in this pathway: XP-A to XP-G.
XP-A is the most severe form of  the disease and is due to defects  in a 30 Kd
nuclear protein called XPA (or XPAC) [2].

The sequence of the XPA protein  is  conserved  from  higher eukaryotes [3] to
yeast (gene RAD14) [4]. XPA is a hydrophilic  protein of 247 to 296 amino-acid
residues which has a C4-type zinc finger motif in its central section.

We have   developed  two  signature  patterns  for  XPA  proteins.  The  first
corresponds to the zinc finger region, the second to a highly conserved region
located some 12 residues after the zinc finger region.

-Consensus pattern: C-x-[DE]-C-x(3)-[LIVMF]-x(1,2)-D-x(2)-L-x(3)-F-x(4)-C-
                    x(2)-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
