* Collagen IV carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) domain profile *
**********************************************************************

Collagens are  major  components of the extracellular matrices of all metazoan
life and play crucial roles in developmental processes and tissue homeostasis.
Collagens are  composed  of  three polypeptide chains (alpha chains) that fold
together to  form  the  characteristic triple helical collagenous domain. Some
types of  triple  helical protomers contain genetically identical alpha chains
forming homotrimers,  whereas  others  contain  two  or  three different alpha
chains forming  heterotrimers.  The  sequences  required to form a collagenous
domain are  Gly-X-Y  repeats  in  which  the  X and Y positions are frequently
proline and  hydroxyproline.  Glycine is required every third residue as it is
the only  amino  acid small enough to pack into the central core of the triple
helix. The  triple  helix-forming parts are surrounded by non-collagenous (NC)
domains of  variable  sequence,  size,  and  shape. Even if the triple helical
parts represent  the most striking feature of collagens, tissue specificity as
well as defined binding of non-collagens seem to be encoded in the NC domains.
The terminal  NC  domains are excised, modified, or incorporated directly into
the final suprastructure, depending on protomer type and function [1,2].

Type IV  collagen  is  one  of the major constituents of basement membranes, a
specialized form   of   extracellular   matrix   underlying   epithelia   that
compartmentalizes tissues  and provides molecular signals for influencing cell
behavior. Each type IV chain contains a long triple-helical collagenous domain
flanked by  a  short  7S  domain of 25 residues and a globular non-collagenous
NC1 domain  of  ~230  residues  at  the  N-  and  C-terminus, respectively. In
protomer assembly,  the  NC1  domains  (monomers)  of  three  chains interact,
forming an  NC1  trimer,  to  select  and  register  chains  for  triple helix
formation. In  network  assembly,  the  NC1 trimers of two protomers interact,
forming a NC1 hexamer structure, to select and connect protomers [3,4,5].

The collagen IV NC1 domain contains 12 cysteines, and all of them are involved
in disulfide  bonds.  It  folds  into  a tertiary structure with predominantly
beta-strands  (see  <PDB:1LI1; A>).  The collagen IV MC1 domain is composed of
two similarly  folded  subdomains  stabilized  by 6 intrachain disulfide bonds
involving the  following  pairs:  C1-C6,  C2-C5,  C3-C4,  C7-C12,  C8-C11, and
C9-C10. Each  subdomain  represents  a compact disulfide-stabilized triangular
structure, from which a finger-like hairpin loop projects into an incompletely
formed six-stranded  beta-sheet  of an adjacent subdomain of the same or of an
adjacent chain clamping the subdomains tightly together [3,4,5].

The profile we developed covers the entire collagen IV NC1 domain.
