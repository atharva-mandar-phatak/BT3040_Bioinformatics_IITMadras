* Globin family profile *
*************************

Globins are heme-containing  proteins involved in  binding and/or transporting
oxygen [1].  They  belong  to  a  very  large and well studied family which is
widely distributed in many organisms. The major groups of globins are:

 - Hemoglobins  (Hb)    from  vertebrates. Hb is the protein  responsible  for
   transporting oxygen  from  the  lungs to other tissues. It is a tetramer of
   two alpha  and  two  beta  chains.  Most  vertebrate  species  also express
   specific embryonic or fetal forms of hemoglobin where the alpha or the beta
   chains are  replaced  by  a  chain  with higher oxygen affinity, as for the
   gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta chains in mammals, for example.
 - Myoglobins (Mg) from vertebrates. Mg is a monomeric protein responsible for
   oxygen storage in muscles.
 - Invertebrate   globins  [2].  A  wide  variety  of  globins  are  found  in
   invertebrates. Molluscs generally have one or two muscle globins which  are
   either monomeric or dimeric.  Insects, such as the midge Chironomus thummi,
   have a large set of extracellular globins.  Nematodes  and  annelids have a
   variety of intracellular and extracellular globins; some of them are multi-
   domain  polypeptides (from two up to nine-domain  globins) and some produce
   large, disulfide-bonded aggregates.
 - Leghemoglobins (Lg) from the root nodules of leguminous plants. Lg provides
   oxygen for bacteroids.
 - Flavohemoproteins  from  bacteria  (Escherichia coli hmpA) and fungi. These
   proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal globin domain and a
   C-terminal FAD-containing   reductase   domain.   In   bacteria   such   as
   Vitreoscilla, the enzyme-associated globin is a single domain protein.

All these    globins  seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. The profile
developed to detect members  of the globin family  is  based  on a  structural
alignment of selected globin sequences.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.

-Note: Protozoan/cyanobacterial  globins  belong  to  another  family which is
 described in <PDOC00933>.
