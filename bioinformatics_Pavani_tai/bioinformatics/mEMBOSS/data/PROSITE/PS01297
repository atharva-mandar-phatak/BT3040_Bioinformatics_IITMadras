************************************
* FLAP/GST2/LTC4S family signature *
************************************

The following mammalian proteins are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Leukotriene  C4  synthase  (EC  4.4.1.20)  (gene  LTC4S),  an  enzyme  that
   catalyzes the production of LTC4 from LTA4.
 - Microsomal glutathione S-transferase II (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST-II) (gene GST2),
   an enzyme that can also produces LTC4 fron LTA4.
 - 5-lipoxygenase  activating  protein (gene FLAP), a protein that seems to be
   required for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase.

These are  proteins  of  150  to 160 residues that contain three transmembrane
segments. As  a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region between the
first and second transmembrane domains.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(3)-F-E-R-V-[FY]-x-A-[NQ]-x-N-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / First entry.
