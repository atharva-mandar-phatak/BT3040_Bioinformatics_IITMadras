**********************************************
* ADP-dependent kinase (ADPK) domain profile *
**********************************************

Although ATP  is  the  most common phosphoryl group donor for kinases, certain
hyperthermophilic archaea,  such  as  Thermococcus  litoralis  and  Pyrococcus
furiosus, utilize    unusual    ADP-dependent    glucokinases   (ADPGKs)   and
phosphofructokinases (ADPPKKs)  in their glycolytic pathways [1-3]. ADPGKs and
ADPPFKs exhibit  significant  similarity,  and  form  an  ADP-dependent kinase
(ADPK) family, which was tentatively named the PFKC family [4]. A ~460-residue
ADPK domain is also found in a bifunctional ADP-dependent gluco/phosphofructo-
kinase (ADP-GK/PFK)  from  Methanococcus  jannaschii  as well as in homologous
hypothetical proteins present in several eukaryotes [5].

The whole  structure  of  the  ADPK domain can be divided into large and small
alpha/beta subdomains (see <PDB:1GC5; A>). The larger subdomain, which carries
the ADP  binding site, consists of a twisted 12-stranded beta sheet flanked on
both faces  by 13 alpha helices and three 3(10) helices, forming an alpha/beta
3-layer sandwich.  The  smaller subdomain, which covers the active site, forms
an alpha/beta  two-layer  structure  containing  5 beta strands and four alpha
helices. The  ADP  molecule  is  buried  in  a  shallow  pocket  in  the large
subdomain. The  binding  of  substrate  sugar induces a structural change, the
small domain closing to form a complete substrate sugar binding site [1-3].

The profile we developed covers the entire ADPK domain.
