* Arterivirus nsp4 proteinase domain profile *
**********************************************

Arteriviruses are   enveloped,   positive-stranded  RNA  viruses  and  include
pathogens of   major   economic  concern  to  the  swine-  and  horse-breeding
industries [E1]:

  - Equine arteritis virus (EAV).
  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).
  - Mice actate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.
  - Simian hemorrhagic fever virus.

The arterivirus  replicase  gene encodes two large precursor polyproteins that
are processed by the viral main proteinase nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4). The
structure of  the  enzyme  reveals  two  chymotrypsin-like  antiparallel beta-
barrels and  an  extra  C-terminal  alpha/beta  domain that may play a role in
mediating protein-protein  interactions  (see  <PDB:1MBM;  A>). The N-terminal
barrel consists of six beta-strands (A1 to F1), while the C-terminal barrel is
composed of  seven  (A2  to G2). The core of both beta-barrels is comprised of
conserved hydrophobic  residues.  The additional C-terminal domain consists of
two pairs   of  short  antiparallel  beta-sheets  and  two  alpha-helices.  It
interacts with  the  C-terminal  barrel  through  an  interface  consisting of
conserved hydrophobic  residues.  A canonical catalytic triad that is composed
of Ser,  His,  and  Asp  is located in the open cleft between the beta-barrels
domain [1,2]. The nsp4 proteinase domain forms peptidase family S32 [E2].

The profile we developed covers the entire nsp4 proteinase domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
