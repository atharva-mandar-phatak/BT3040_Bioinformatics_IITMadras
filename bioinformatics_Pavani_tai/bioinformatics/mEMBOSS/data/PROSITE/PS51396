* PUL domain profile *
**********************

The PUL  (after PLAP, UFD3 and lub1) domain is a predicted predominantly alpha
helical globular  domain  found in eukaryotes. It is found in association with
either WD  repeats  (see  <PDOC00574>) and the PFU domain (see <PDOC51394>) or
PPPDE and  thioredoxin (see <PDOC00172>) domains. The PUL domain is a protein-
protein interaction domain [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a PUL domain are listed below:

 - Saccharomyces   cerevisiae   DOA1   (UFD3,  ZZZ4),  involved  in  ubiquitin
   conjugation pathway.  DOA1  participates in the regulation of the ubiquitin
   conjugation pathway  involving  CDC48  by  hindering multiubiquitination of
   substrates at the CDC48 chaperone.
 - Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  ubiquitin  homeostasis  protein lub1, acts as a
   negative regulator of vacuole-dependent ubiquitin degradation.
 - Mammalian phospholipase A-2-activating protein (PLA2P, PLAA), the homologue
   of DOA1.  PLA2P  plays  an  important  role  in  the regulation of specific
   inflammatory disease processes.

The profile we developed covers the entire PUL domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
