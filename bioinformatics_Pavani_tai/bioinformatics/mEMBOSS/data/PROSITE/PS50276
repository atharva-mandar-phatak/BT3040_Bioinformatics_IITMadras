* Pancreatic hormone family signature and profile *
***************************************************

Pancreatic hormone (PP) [1] is a  peptide  synthesized in pancreatic islets of
Langherhans, which  acts    as  a regulator of pancreatic and gastrointestinal
functions.   A  number of other  active peptides  are homologous to pancreatic
hormone:

 - Neuropeptide Y (NPY)  [2],  one  of  the  most  abundant  peptides  in  the
   mammalian nervous system.  NPY is implicated in the control  of feeding and
   the secretion of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone.
 - Peptide YY  (PYY)  [3].  PPY  is  a  gut  peptide  that  inhibits  exocrine
   pancreatic secretion, has a  vasoconstrictory  action  and inhibits jejunal
   and colonic mobility.
 - Various NPY and PYY-like polypeptides from fish and amphibians [4,5].
 - Neuropeptide F (NPF) from invertebrates such as worms and snail [6].
 - Skin  peptide Tyr-Tyr (SPYY) from the frog Phyllomedusa bicolor. SPYY shows
   a large spectra of antibacterial and antifungal activity.

All these  peptides  are 36 to 39 amino acids long. Like most active peptides,
their C-terminal  is  amidated  and  they  are  synthesized  as larger protein
precursors. The  signature  for  these  peptides  is  based  on the last 17 C-
terminal residues,  where  three positions are completely conserved. A profile
was also developed that spans the whole peptide.
