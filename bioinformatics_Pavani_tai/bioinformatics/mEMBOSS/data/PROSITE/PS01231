* RNA methyltransferase trmA family signatures *
************************************************

In Escherichia coli, the trmA protein  is a tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.35) that catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methylation of
U54 in  all  tRNAs. Orthologs of trmA are found in many eubacterial species. A
number of uncharacterized homologs of trmA have been found [1]:

 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical protein ygcA and HI0333,  the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0958.
 - Chlamydia trachomatis protein HOM1.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC4G8.07c.

It is  probable  that  ygcA/HI0333 and HI0958 are probably responsible for the
methylation of  U747  and  U1939  in 23S rRNA. In trmA, a cysteine is known to
participate in  the  catalytic mechanism by forming a covalent adduct to C6 of
uracil.

We selected  two  conserved  regions as signature patterns, the first includes
the active  site  cysteine  and the second one, located at the C-terminal end,
contains a conserved histidine.
