* G-protein coupled receptors family 1 signature and profile *
**************************************************************

G-protein  coupled  receptors  [1  to 4,E1] (also called R7G) are an extensive
group of  hormones,  neurotransmitters,  odorants  and  light  receptors which
transduce extracellular  signals   by  interaction  with  guanine  nucleotide-
binding (G) proteins. The receptors that are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1A to 1F, 2A to 2C, 4, 5A, 5B, 6 and 7 [5].
 - Acetylcholine, muscarinic-type, M1 to M5.
 - Adenosine A1, A2A, A2B and A3 [6].
 - Adrenergic alpha-1A to -1C; alpha-2A to -2D;  beta-1 to -3 [7].
 - Angiotensin II types I and II.
 - Bombesin subtypes 3 and 4.
 - Bradykinin B1 and B2.
 - c3a and C5a anaphylatoxin.
 - Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2.
 - Chemokines C-C CC-CKR-1 to CC-CKR-8.
 - Chemokines C-X-C CXC-CKR-1 to CXC-CKR-4.
 - Cholecystokinin-A and cholecystokinin-B/gastrin.
 - Dopamine D1 to D5 [8].
 - Endothelin ET-a and ET-b [9].
 - fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) (N-formyl peptide).
 - Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH-R) [10].
 - Galanin.
 - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP-R).
 - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH-R).
 - Histamine H1 and H2 (gastric receptor I).
 - Lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone (LSH-R) [10].
 - Melanocortin MC1R to MC5R.
 - Melatonin.
 - Neuromedin B (NMB-R).
 - Neuromedin K (NK-3R).
 - Neuropeptide Y types 1 to 6.
 - Neurotensin (NT-R).
 - Octopamine (tyramine), from insects.
 - Odorants [11].
 - Opioids delta-, kappa- and mu-types [12].
 - Oxytocin (OT-R).
 - Platelet activating factor (PAF-R).
 - Prostacyclin.
 - Prostaglandin D2.
 - Prostaglandin E2, EP1 to EP4 subtypes.
 - Prostaglandin F2.
 - Purinoreceptors (ATP) [13].
 - Somatostatin types 1 to 5.
 - Substance-K (NK-2R).
 - Substance-P (NK-1R).
 - Thrombin.
 - Thromboxane A2.
 - Thyrotropin (TSH-R) [10].
 - Thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH-R).
 - Vasopressin V1a, V1b and V2.
 - Visual pigments (opsins and rhodopsin) [14].

 - Proto-oncogene mas.
 - A number of orphan receptors (whose ligand is not known) from  mammals  and
   birds.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative    receptors  C06G4.5, C38C10.1, C43C3.2,
   T27D1.3 and ZC84.4.
 - Three putative receptors encoded  in  the  genome of cytomegalovirus: US27,
   US28, and UL33.
 - ECRF3, a putative receptor encoded in the genome of herpesvirus saimiri.

The  structure of all  these receptors is  thought  to be identical. They have
seven hydrophobic regions,  each  of which most probably  spans  the membrane.
The N-terminus is located on the  extracellular  side of the  membrane  and is
often  glycosylated,  while  the  C-terminus  is  cytoplasmic   and  generally
phosphorylated.  Three extracellular loops  alternate with three intracellular
loops to link the seven transmembrane regions.  Most,  but  not  all  of these
receptors, lack a signal peptide. The most conserved parts  of  these proteins
are the transmembrane regions and the first two cytoplasmic loops. A conserved
acidic-Arg-aromatic triplet is  present  in  the N-terminal  extremity  of the
second cytoplasmic loop [15] and could be implicated in the interaction with G
proteins.

To detect this widespread family of  proteins we have developed a pattern that
contains the conserved triplet and that also spans the major part of the third
transmembrane helix.  We  have  also  developed a profile that spans the seven
transmembrane regions.

-Consensus pattern: [GSTALIVMFYWC]-[GSTANCPDE]-{EDPKRH}-x-{PQ}-[LIVMNQGA]-
                    {RK}-{RK}-[LIVMFT]-[GSTANC]-[LIVMFYWSTAC]-[DENH]-R-
                    [FYWCSH]-{PE}-x-[LIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: the majority
 of receptors. About 5% are not detected.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 64.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
