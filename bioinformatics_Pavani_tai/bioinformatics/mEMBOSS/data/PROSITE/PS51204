* HSA domain profile *
**********************

The helicase/SANT-associated (HSA) domain is a predicted DNA-binding domain of
~75 amino  acids  [1],  which  is  found  in the eukaryotic SRCAP/p400/DOM and
SNF2/brahma families [2]. While each family has the core sequences that define
the HSA  domain,  they  each  also  have additional sequences that distinguish
these families  from one another. For example, the sequence HWDY(L/C)EEEM(Q/V)
is found  in the SRCAP/p400/DOM family, whereas the sequence HQE(Y/F)LNSILQ is
found in  the  SNF2  /brahma  family [2]. In addition to the SANT and helicase
(see <PDOC51192>)  domains,  the  HSA domain is also found in association with
bromo (see <PDOC00550>) [1].

Some proteins known to contain a HSA domain are listed below [2]:

 - Yeast transcription regulatory protein SWI2/SNF2.
 - Drosophila brahma.
 - Mammalian SNF2-alpha (BRM).
 - Mammalian SNF2-beta (BRG).
 - Yeast  SNF2-related CBP-activating protein (SRCAP), a coactivator for CREB-
   and nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcriptional activation.
 - Drosophila  domino  (DOM),  the  homolog  of  SCRAP.  It  is  essential for
   organismal viability  and  has  been  implicated  in several aspects of fly
   development, including   hematopoeisis,   wing   development,   and  female
   fertility.
 - Mammalian SRCAP.
 - Mammalian SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase-containing p400/Domino.

The profile we developed covers the entire HSA domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
