* Thrombospondin type-3 (TSP3) repeat profile *
***********************************************

Thrombospondins are multimeric multidomain glycoproteins that function at cell
surfaces  and  in  the  extracellular matrix milieu. They act as regulators of
cell interactions in vertebrates. They are divided into two subfamilies, A and
B,  according to their overall molecular organization. The subgroup A proteins
TSP-1  and  -2  contain an N-terminal domain, a VWFC domain (see <PDOC00928>),
three   TSP1   repeats   (see   <PDOC50092>),   three  EGF-like  domains  (see
<PDOC00021>), TSP3 repeats and a C-terminal domain (see <PDOC51236>). They are
assembled as trimer. The subgroup B thrombospondins, designated TSP-3, -4, and
COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, also designated TSP-5) are distinct
in  that they contain unique N-terminal regions, lack the VWFC domain and TSP1
repeats,  contain  four  copies  of  EGF-like  domains,  and  are assembled as
pentamers  [1].  EGF,  TSP3  repeats  and  the  C-terminal domain are thus the
hallmark of a thrombospondin.

The  calcium-binding  TSP3  repeats are a tandem of aspartic acid-rich motifs,
which  resembles  EF hands in the acidic side chains. But unlike EF hands, the
calcium-binding  loops  of  the  TSP3  repeats  are  not  flanked by secondary
structure elements. The structure of the TSP3 repeats has been solved (see for
example  <PDB:1YO8>)  [2,3].  They form a wire draped around the calcium ions.
The  individual  calcium-binding repeats are linked by disulfide bonds to each
other.

The profile we developed covers the entire TSP3 repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
