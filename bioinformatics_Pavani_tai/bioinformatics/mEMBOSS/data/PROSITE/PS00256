* Adipokinetic hormone family signature *
*****************************************

Adipokinetic  hormones (AKH) [1,2] are small active peptides  produced by some
insect species.   They bring on the release of diglycerides from  the fat body
and then  stimulate  the flight muscles to use them as an energy source. Other
types of active peptides structurally related to AKH are:

 - Hypertrehalosaemic  factors (HTF), which are neuropeptides that elevate the
   level of trehalose in the hemolymph of some insects.
 - Red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), a peptide that stimulates pigment
   concentration in prawn and crab erythrophores.

These peptides  are  eight  to  ten  amino  acid  residues long. The signature
pattern to detect them  is based on the sequence of  the first eight residues,
which are common to all these peptides.

-Consensus pattern: Q-[LV]-[NT]-[FY]-[ST]-x(2)-W
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 3.
