* DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family signature *
******************************************************

Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication [1]. It
involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that  have been missed by the
proofreading  element  of the DNA polymerase complex.     The sequence of some
proteins involved in mismatch repair in different organisms have been found to
be evolutionary related [2,3]. One of these families is called mutS [4,E1], it
consists of:

 - Prokaroytic  protein  mutS  protein  (also  called  hexA  in  Streptococcus
   pneumoniae).  Muts is thought to carry out the mismatch recognition step of
   DNA repair.
 - Eukaryotic MSH1, which is involved in mitochondrial DNA repair.
 - Eukaryotic MSH2,  which  is  involved  in  nuclear postreplication mismatch
   repair. MSH2 heterodimerizes with MSH6.  In man, MSH2 is involved in a form
   of familial hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).
 - Eukaryotic MSH3, which is probably involved in the repair of large loops.
 - Eukaryotic MSH4, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Eukaryotic MSH5, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Eukaryotic MSH6 (also known as G/T mismatch binding protein), a  DNA-repair
   protein that binds to G/T mismatches through heterodimerization with MSH2.
 - Prokaryotic protein mutS2 whose function is not yet known.
 - A coral (Sarcophyton glaucum) mitochondrial encoded mutS-like protein.

As a signature pattern for  this class of mismatch repair proteins we selected
a region rich in glycine and negatively charged residues. This region is found
in the C-terminal  section of  these  proteins;  about  80  residues to the C-
terminal of an ATP-binding site motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).

-Consensus pattern: [STA]-[LIVMF]-x-[LIVM]-x-D-E-[LIVMFY]-[GCA]-[RKHAS]-[GS]-
                    [GST]-x(4)-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for mutS2.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
