* Involucrin signature *
************************

Involucrin [1,2] is a protein present in keratinocytes of epidermis and other
stratified squamous epithelia.  Involucrin  first appears in the cell cytosol,
but ultimately  becomes cross-linked  to membrane proteins by transglutaminase
thus helping in  the  formation  of  an  insoluble envelope beneath the plasma
membrane.

Structurally  involucrin consists of a conserved region of about 75 amino acid
residues  followed  by  two  extremely  variable length segments  that contain
glutamine-rich tandem repeats. The  glutamine  residues  in the tandem repeats
are the substrate for the tranglutaminase in the cross-linking reaction.   The
total size of the protein  varies  from  285 residues (in dog) to 835 residues
(in orangutan).

The signature pattern for  involucrin  corresponds to the N-terminal extremity
of the protein.

-Consensus pattern: <M-S-[QH]-Q-x-T-[LV]-P-V-T-[LV]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
