* Ribosomal protein L30 signature *
***********************************

Ribosomal protein L30 is one of the proteins from the large ribosomal subunit.
L30 belongs to a family  of ribosomal proteins which, on the basis of sequence
similarities [1], groups:

 - Eubacterial L30.
 - Archaebacterial L30.
 - Drosophila L7.
 - Slime mold L7.
 - Mammalian L7.
 - Fungi L7 (YL8).
 - Yeast mitochondrial L33.

L30 from  eubacteria are  small  proteins   of  about  60 residues, those from
archaebacteria are proteins of about 150 residues.  Eukaryotic L7 are proteins
of about  250  to  270 residues.  The schematic relationship between the three
groups of proteins is shown below.

'*': position of the pattern.

The  signature  pattern  for  this  family of  ribosomal  proteins  spans  the
N-terminal half of the region common to all these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [IVTAS]-[LIVM]-x(2)-[LF]-x-[LI]-x-[KRHQEG]-x(2)-[STNQH]-x-
                    [IVTR]-x(10)-[LMSN]-[LIV]-x(2)-[LIVA]-x(2)-[LMFY]-[IVT]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
