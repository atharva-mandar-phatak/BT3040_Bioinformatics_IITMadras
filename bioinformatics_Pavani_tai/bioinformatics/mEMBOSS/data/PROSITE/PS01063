* Sigma-70 factors ECF subfamily signature *
********************************************

Sigma factors [1] are bacterial transcription initiation factors  that promote
the attachment of the core RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are
then released.  They  alter  the  specificity  of  promoter  recognition. Most
bacteria express  a multiplicity of sigma factors.  With regards  to  sequence
similarity, sigma  factors  can be grouped into two classes: the  sigma-54 and
sigma-70 families.  The  sigma-70  family includes, in addition to the primary
sigma factor, a wide variety  of sigma factors.  It also  includes a divergent
subfamily [2] that regulates  gene encoding for proteins with extracytoplasmic
function. The proteins that are currently known to belong to this sigma factor
subfamily, known as ECF, are:

 - algU, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which regulates genes  for extracellular
   alginate biosynthesis.
 - carQ, from Myxococcus xanthus, which  is involved  in the regulation of the
   light induced biosynthesis of membrane-localized carotenoids.
 - cnrH, from  Alcaligenes eutrophus plasmid pMOL28, which regulates the genes
   for a membrane-located efflux  system that confers resistance to nickel and
   cobalt.
 - fecI, from Escherichia coli,  which regulates the fec genes for periplasmic
   iron dicitrate transport.
 - hrpL,  from  Pseudomonas  syringae,  which is involved in the activation of
   hrp loci genes which are involved in plant pathogenicity.
 - rpoE,   from  Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella  typhimurium  and  Haemophilus
   influenzae. RpoE  is  involved in heat shock and oxidative stress response;
   it is  believed  to  control  protein  processing  in  the extracytoplasmic
   compartment.
 - rfaY, from Xanthomonas campestris,  which is involved in lipopolysaccharide
   biosynthesis and pathogenicity.
 - sigE, from Streptococcus coelicolor, which is involved in the transcription
   of the dagA gene coding for an extracellular agar-degrading enzyme.
 - sigV, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigX, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigY, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigZ, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - HI1459, a hypothetical Haemophilus influenzae sigma factor.

As a  signature  pattern  for  the  ECF  subfamily  we  chose  the region that
corresponds to  subdomain  2.2  in classical sigma-70 factors [3]; this region
seems to  be  involved  in  the  binding  of  the sigma factor to the core RNA
polymerase.
