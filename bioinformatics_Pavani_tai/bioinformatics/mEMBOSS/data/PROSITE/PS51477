* PAH domain profile *
**********************

The paired  amphipathic  helix  (PAH)  domain is a protein-protein interaction
domain present   in   eukaryotic   proteins  implied  in  transcription  down-
regulation, such  as the SIN3 family of proteins. This domain occurs generally
in repeats  at  the  N-terminus of the protein containing it [1]. Sin3a is the
central component of a transcriptional co-repressor complex that comprises the
histone deacetylase  (HDAC)  1 and 2. The three PAH domains of Sin3a associate
with numerous  DNA-binding  proteins  enabling  the  recruitment  of  the Sin3
complex to  chromatin.  PAH1 is known to interact so far with Opi1, Pf1, NRSF,
N-CoR and SMRT while PAH2 interacts with a broader range of proteins including
Mad protein  family  members, Sp1-like repressor proteins, HBP1, Pf1 and yeast
Ume6 [2,3].

The 3D  structure  of the PAH domain has been determined. The PAH domain folds
into a   left-handed,   four-helix   bundle   structure  (see  <PDB:2RMS>  and
<PDB:1G1E>). The  amino  acids  in each of the helices and in the turn regions
are arranged  in  such a way as to form a hydrophic cleft that constitutes the
main surface of interaction with the Sin3 interaction domain (SID) amphipathic
helix of transcription inhibitors such as SAP25 or Mad1 [1,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire PAH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
