* Ephrin receptor-binding (ephrin RBD) domain signature and profile *
*********************************************************************

Ephrins are a family of proteins [1] that are ligands of class V (EPH-related)
receptor protein-tyrosine  kinases  (see <PDOC00629>). Initially identified as
regulators of  axon pathfinding and neuronal cell migration, the Eph receptors
and their  ephrin  ligands are now known to have roles in many other cell-cell
interactions, including  those  of  vascular endothelial cells and specialized
epithelia [2].

Ephrins are  membrane-attached  proteins  of  205  to 340 residues. Attachment
appears to be crucial for their normal function. Type-A ephrins  are linked to
the membrane  via  a  GPI  linkage,  while  type-B ephrins are type-I membrane
proteins.

The globular  ephrin  receptor-binding  domain  (ephrin  RBD) is a beta barrel
composed of  eight  strands  arranged  in two sheets around a hydrophobic core
(see <PDB:1IKO>).  Interspersed between beta strands are two alpha helices and
one 3(10)  helix.  The  sheets are composed of mixed parallel and antiparallel
beta strands  arranged  in  a  Greek  key  topology.  Like  other cell-surface
proteins, ephrins  contain  disulfide  bonds  to enhance stability. Two buried
disulfide bonds are present: one pair holds together beta strands C and F, and
the other  pair  anchors  two small helices, E and I, at the top of the barrel
[2,3].

We developed  both  a  pattern  and  a  profile for the ephrin RBD domain. The
profile covers the entire ephrin RBD domain.

-Consensus pattern: [KRQ]-[LF]-[CST]-x-K-[IF]-Q-x-[FY]-[ST]-[PA]-x(3)-G-x-E-F-
                    x(5)-[FY](2)-x(2)-[SA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: October 2011 / Text revised; profile added.
