* Rubredoxin-like domain profile *
**********************************

The rubredoxin-like  domain  is a 45- to 55-residue domain containing one iron
atom tetrahedrally coordinated to four cysteinyl residues (Fe(S-Cys)4 center).
It is involved in electron transfer processes [1,2].

The most  conserved  feature  of  the rubredoxin-like domain is the cluster of
four cysteines  involved  in  iron binding (Cys-x-x-Cys-x(n)-Cys-x-x-Cys) [2].
Structure analyses of several rubredoxin-like domains have shown that they are
folded into  a  short  three-stranded  antiparallel beta-sheet and a number of
loops (see <PDB:1RDG>) [3,4,5,6].

Proteins known to contain a rubredoxin-like domain are listed below:

 - Rubredoxin   (Rd),  a  small  electron-transfer  prokaryotic  protein  (see
   <PDOC00179>).
 - Rubrerythrin  (Rr),  a  non-heme  protein  isolated from anaerobic sulfate-
   reducing bacteria.
 - Flavorubredoxin,   a   bacterial   protein  involved  in  elctron  transfer
   processes.
 - Nigerythrin, a prokaryotic protein of unknown function.

The profile we developed covers the entire rubredoxin-like domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
