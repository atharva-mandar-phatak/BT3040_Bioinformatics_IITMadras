* LIF / OSM family signature *
******************************

On the  basis  of  functional and structural similarities, the following small
cytokines can be classified into a single family [1,2]:

 - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (also known as differentiation-stimulating
   factor). LIF is a mammalian growth factor that controls the differentiation
   and proliferation of   hematopoietic  cells  as  well  as those of  several
   other cellular lineages.
 - Oncostatin (OSM),  a growth  regulator  produced  by a  number of mammalian
   cells lines.  OSM  is capable of inhibiting  the replication of a number of
   tumor cells.

As a signature pattern for these cytokines, we selected a  conserved region in
their C-terminal section.  This  region  is  centered on a  conserved cysteine
which has been shown [3], in OSM, to be involved in a disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: [PST]-x(4)-F-[NQ]-x-K-x(3)-C-x-[LF]-L-x(2)-Y-[HK]
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: It has been said [2]  that  LIF and OSM can  be  included  in  the IL-6
 family of cytokines (see the relevant entry <PDOC00227>), but while all these
 cytokines seem  to  be  structurally  related, the sequence similarity is not
 high enough to allow the use of a single consensus pattern.

-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
