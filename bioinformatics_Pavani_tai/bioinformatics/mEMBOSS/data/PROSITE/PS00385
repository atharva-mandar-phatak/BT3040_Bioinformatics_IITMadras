*******************************************

Alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) [1] is a  lysosomal  enzyme  responsible  for
hydrolyzing   the   alpha-1,6-linked  fucose  joined   to   the   reducing-end
N-acetylglucosamine  of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins. Deficiency
of alpha-L-fucosidase results in the lysosomal storage disease fucosidosis.

A cysteine residue is important for the activity of the enzyme.  There is only
one cysteine conserved  between  the sequence of  mammalian alpha-L-fucosidase
and that of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. We have derived a pattern
from the region around that conserved cysteine.

-Consensus pattern: P-x(2)-L-x(3)-K-W-E-x-C
                    [C may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These proteins belong to family 29  in  the  classification of glycosyl
 hydrolases [2,E1].
