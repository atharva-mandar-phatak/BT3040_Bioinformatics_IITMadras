* Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class-II signatures *
******************************************************

Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) [1,2] is a glycolytic enzyme that
catalyzes  the reversible  aldol cleavage   or  condensation of  fructose-1,6-
bisphosphate into  dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
There are  two  classes  of  fructose-bisphosphate  aldolases  with  different
catalytic mechanisms.  Class-II aldolases [2], mainly found in prokaryotes and
fungi, are homodimeric enzymes which  require a divalent metal ion - generally
zinc - for their activity.

This family also includes the following proteins:

 - Escherichia  coli  galactitol  operon  protein  gatY  which  catalyzes  the
   transformation of tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate into glycerone phosphate and D-
   glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
 - Escherichia coli N-acetyl galactosamine operon protein agaY which catalyzes
   the same reaction as that of gatY.

As signature  patterns for  this class  of  enzyme, we  selected two conserved
regions. The first  pattern is  located in the  first half of the sequence and
contains two  histidine  residues  that  have been shown [4] to be involved in
binding a  zinc  ion.  The  second  is  located  in the C-terminal section and
contains clustered acidic residues and glycines.

-Consensus pattern: [FYVMT]-x(1,3)-[LIVMH]-[APNT]-[LIVM]-x(1,2)-[LIVM]-H-x-D-
                    H-[GACH]
                    [The two H's are zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Mycoplasma pneumoniae aldolase.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-E-x-E-[LIVM]-G-x(2)-[GM]-[GSTA]-x-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
