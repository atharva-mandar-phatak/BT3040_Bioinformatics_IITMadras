* Arrestins signature *
***********************

Arrestin (or S-antigen) [1] is a protein  that interacts  with light-activated
phosphorylated  rhodopsin  thereby  inhibiting  or 'arresting'  its ability to
interact with transducin.   In mammals, arrestin is associated with autoimmune
uveitis.

Arrestin belongs to a family of closely related proteins including:

 - Beta-arrestin-1  and  -2,  proteins  that  regulate  the  function of beta-
   adrenergic receptors.  They  bind  to the phosphorylated form of the latter
   thereby causing a significant impairment of their capacity to activate G(S)
   proteins.
 - Cone  photoreceptors  C-arrestin  (arrestin-X)  [2],  which  could  bind to
   phosphorylated red/green opsins.
 - Phosrestins  I  and  II from Drosophila and related insects. These proteins
   undergo light-induced   phosphorylation  and  play  an  important  role  in
   photoreceptor transduction.

Sequence comparison of proteins from the arrestin family shows a high level of
conservation. As  a  signature pattern, we selected a region located in the N-
terminal section that contains many charged and hydrophobic residues.
