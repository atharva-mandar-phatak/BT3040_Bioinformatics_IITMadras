* Dynamin family signature *
****************************

Dynamin [1,2] is  a  microtubule-associated force-producing  protein of 100 Kd
which is involved in  the  production of microtubule bundles and which is able
to bind and hydrolyze GTP.  Dynamin  is structurally related  to the following
proteins:

 - Drosophila shibire  protein (gene shi) [3].  Shibire is, very probably, the
   Drosophila cognate of mammalian dynamin.  It seems to provide the motor for
   vesicular transport during endocytosis.
 - Yeast vacuolar  sorting protein VPS1 (or SPO15) [4], a protein which  could
   also be involved in microtubule-associated motility.
 - Yeast  protein  MGM1  [5],  which  is  required  for  mitochondrial  genome
   maintenance.
 - Yeast protein DNM1, which is involved in endocytosis.
 - Interferon induced Mx proteins [6,7].  Interferon alpha  or beta induce the
   synthesis of a family of closely related proteins.  Most  of these proteins
   are known to confer resistance to influenza viruses and/or rhabdoviruses on
   transfected mammalian cell in culture.

The  three  motifs  found  in  all  GTP-binding proteins are located in the N-
terminal part of these proteins.   The signature pattern that we developed for
these proteins  is  based  on  a  highly  conserved  region  downstream of the
ATP/GTP-binding motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).

-Consensus pattern: L-P-[RKT]-[GD]-[STNKEA]-[GND]-[LIVMG]-[VICA]-T-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
