* Calcium-binding EGF-like domain signature *
*********************************************

A sequence  of  about  forty amino-acid residues long found in the sequence of
epidermal growth  factor  (EGF)  has been shown [1-6] to be present in a large
number of  membrane-bound  and  extracellular,  mostly  animal  proteins  (see
<PDOC00021>). Many  of  these  proteins  require  calcium for their biological
function and  a  calcium-binding  site  has  been  found  to be located at the
N-terminus of  some  EGF-like  domains [8]. Calcium-binding may be crucial for
numerous protein-protein  interactions.  Proteins that are  known  or that are
predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF-like domains are listed below.

 - Bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP-1), a  protein which induces cartilage  and
   bone formation  and  which  expresses  metalloendopeptidase  activity  (1-2
   copies). Homologous proteins are found in sea urchin - suBMP (1 copy) - and
   in Drosophila - the dorsal-ventral patterning protein tolloid (2 copies).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  developmental proteins lin-12 (2 out of 13 copies)
   and glp-1 (10 copies).
 - Calcium-dependent serine proteinase (CASP) which degrades the extracellular
   matrix proteins type I and IV collagen and fibronectin (1 copy).
 - Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP (2 out of 4 copies).
 - Coagulation factors VII, IX, and X (1 out of 2 copies).
 - Complement C1r components (1 copy).
 - Complement C1s components (1 copy).
 - Complement-activating component of Ra-reactive factor (RARF) (1 copy).
 - Crumbs,  an  epithelial  development  protein from Drosophila (12 out of 29
   copies).
 - Epidermal growth factor precursor (3 out of 9 copies).
 - Fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2 (43 out of 47 copies).
 - Fibropellins  IA  (8 out of 21 copies) and III (6 out of 8 copies) from the
   apical lamina - a component of the  extracellular matrix - of sea urchin.
 - Fibulin-1  (8  out  of  9  copies)  and  fibulin-2 (9-10 out of 10-11), two
   extracellular matrix proteins.
 - Leucocyte antigen CD97 (2 out of 3 copies), cell surface  glycoprotein EMR1
   (5 out of 6 copies) and cell surface glycoprotein F4/80 (6 out 7 copies).
 - LDL  receptors, which bind and transport low-density lipoproteins (1 out of
   3 copies).
 - Neurogenic  proteins  Notch  (21-22 out of 36), Xotch (21 out of 36), Motch
   (16 out  of 34) and the human homolog Tan-1 (18 out of 36), Delta (2 out of
   9 copies),  Drosophila  Serrate  (5  out of 14 copies) and Slit (2 out of 7
   copies).
 - Nidogen (also called entactin), a basement membrane protein from sea squirt
   (0 out of 2) and mammals (2 out of 6).
 - Proteoglycans  versican  (1  out  of  2  copies)  and  chondroitin  sulfate
   proteoglycan (gene PG-M) (1 out of 2 copies).
 - S1-5,  a  human  extracellular  protein whose ultimate activity is probably
   modulated by the environment (5 copies).
 - Thrombomodulin   (fetomodulin),  which  together  with  thrombin  activates
   protein C (2 out of 6 copies).
 - Thrombospondins  1 and 2  (1 out of 3 copies), 3 and 4 (2 out of 4 copies),
   adhesive  glycoproteins  that mediate   cell-to-cell   and   cell-to-matrix
   interactions.
 - Thyroid peroxidase 1 (EC 1.11.1.8) (1 copy).
 - Transforming  growth  factor  beta-1 binding protein (TGF-B1-BP) (14 out of
   16 or 18 copies).
 - Uromodulin (Tamm-horsfall urinary glycoprotein) (THP) (2 out of 3 copies).
 - Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein S (3 out of 4 copies).
 - 63 Kd sperm flagellar membrane protein from sea urchin (1 out of 3 copies).
 - 93 Kd protein (gene nel) from chicken (2 out of 5 copies).
 - Hypothetical   337.6  Kd  protein  T20G5.3  from  Caenorhabditis elegans (1
   out of 44 copies).

For human coagulation factor IX it has been shown [7] that the calcium-ligands
form a pentagonal bipyramid.  The first, third and fourth conserved negatively
charged or   polar  residues  are  side  chain  ligands.  Latter  is  possibly
hydroxylated (see  <PDOC00010>)  [8].  A conserved aromatic residue as well as
the second   conserved   negative  residue  are  thought  to  be  involved  in
stabilizing the calcium-binding site.

Like in non-calcium binding EGF-like domains there are six conserved cysteines
and the  structure  of  both  types is very similar as calcium-binding induces
only strictly local structural changes [8].

'*': position of patterns.

We have  used the N-terminal part of the EGF domain as a consensus pattern. It
includes the negative N-terminus and the possible hydroxylation site.

-Consensus pattern: [DEQN]-x-[DEQN](2)-C-x(3,14)-C-x(3,7)-C-x-[DN]-x(4)-[FY]-
                    x-C
                    [The 4 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
