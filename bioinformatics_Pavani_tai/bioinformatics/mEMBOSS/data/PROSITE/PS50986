* MANSC domain profile *
************************

The MANSC (motif at N terminus with seven cysteines) domain is a module with a
well-conserved seven  cysteine  motif  that  is  present  at the N terminus of
higher multicellular   animal  membrane  and  extracellular  proteins.  It  is
possible that  some  of  the  cysteine  residues  in  the  MANSC  domain  form
structurally important  disulfide  bridges.  Five  classes of proteins contain
single copies of the MANSC domain:

 - Proteins with unkown function containing a signal peptide and transmembrane
   region.
 - Low-density  lipoprotein  receptor-related  protein 11 (LRP-11) and similar
   proteins with  signal  peptide, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain (see
   <PDOC50093>), low-density  lipoprotein receptor domain class A (LDLRA) (see
   <PDOC00929>) and transmembrane region.
 - Uncharacterized  proteins  with  signal  peptide,  LDLRA  and transmembrane
   region.
 - Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1) proteins with signal
   peptide, two  tandem repeats of Kunitz domains (see <PDOC00252>), LDLRA and
   transmembrane region.

All of  the  MANSC-containing proteins contain predicted transmembrane regions
and signal peptides. It has been proposed that the MANSC domain in HAI-1 might
function through   binding   with   hepatocyte  growth  factor  activator  and
matriptase [1].

The profile we developed covers the entire MANSC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: May 2004 / First entry.
