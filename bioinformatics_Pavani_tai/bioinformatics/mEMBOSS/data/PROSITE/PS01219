***********************************
* Ammonium transporters signature *
***********************************

A number  of  proteins  involved  in  the  transport of ammonium ions across a
membrane as well as some yet uncharacterized proteins have been shown [1,2] to
be evolutionary related. These proteins are:

 - Yeast ammonium transporters MEP1, MEP2 and MEP3.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana high affinity ammonium transporter (gene AMT1).
 - Corynebacterium glutamicum ammonium and methylammonium transport system.
 - Escherichia coli putative ammonium transporter amtB.
 - Bacillus subtilis nrgA.

 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY338.09c.
 - Synechocystis  strain  PCC  6803 hypothetical proteins sll0108, sll0537 and
   sll1017.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical proteins MJ0058 and MJ1343.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C05E11.4, F49E11.3 and M195.3.

As expected by their transport function, these proteins are highly hydrophobic
and seem  to  contain  from 10 to 12 transmembrane domains. The best conserved
region seems to be located in the fifth (or sixth) transmembrane region and is
used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: D-[FYWS]-[AS]-G-[GSC]-x(2)-[IV]-x(3)-[SAG](2)-x(2)-[SAG]-
                    [LIVMF]-x(3)-[LIVMFYWA](2)-x-[GK]-x-R
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: These  proteins  belongs  to  family  TC 2.49 in  the classification of
 transporters [3].

-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
