Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
(EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
or steroid biogenesis.

In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.

There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
condensation reaction.

Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
[4].

We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of
which are  based  on  the regions around the biologically important cysteines.
The third  is  based  on  a  highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of
these proteins.
