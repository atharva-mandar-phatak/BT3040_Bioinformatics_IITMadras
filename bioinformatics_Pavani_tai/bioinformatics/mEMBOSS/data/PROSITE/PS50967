* HRDC domain profile *
***********************

The helicase  and  RNaseD  C-terminal (HRDC) domain is an 80-amino acid domain
usually found  at  the  C-terminus of RecQ helicases and RNase D homologs from
various organisms, including human, yeast and bacteria [1]. The HRDC domain is
involved in  the  binding  of DNA to specific DNA structures (e.g. long-forked
duplexes and   Holliday   junctions)   that  are  formed  during  replication,
recombination or transcription [2].

The 3D structure of the HRDC domain consists of five helices (see <PDB:1D8B>).
Conserved residues  in  all  five helices are important for the packing of the
HRDC fold [3].

Some proteins known to contain a HRDC domain are listed below:

 - Animal  Werner  syndrome  helicase  (WRN). In human, defects in WRN are the
   cause of  Werner  syndrome  (WS),  a  rare  autosomal  recessive  progeroid
   syndrome characterized  by  the  premature  onset  of  multiple age-related
   disorders.
 - Animal  Bloom's  syndrome  protein (EC 3.6.1.-) (BLM). In human, defects in
   BLM are  the  cause of Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder
   characterized by  proportionate  pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, sun-
   sensitive telangiectatic  hypo-  and hyperpigmented skin, predisposition to
   malignancy, and chromosomal instability.
 - Human PM-Scl autoantigen.
 - Yeast  SGS1, the ortholog of BLM. It is required for chromosome segregation
   and interacts with topoisomerases I and II.

The profile we developed covers the entire HRDC domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
