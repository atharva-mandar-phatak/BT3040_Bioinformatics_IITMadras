* YEATS domain profile *
************************

The YEATS  (for YNL107w, ENL, AF-9, and TFIIF small subunit) domain is a ~120-
amino acid  module,  which is often found in subunits of complexes involved in
chromatin modification  and  transcriptional  regulation.  The  structure  and
function of the YEATS domain are unknown [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a YEATS domain are listed below:

 - Yeast  YNL107w or  YAF9  (yeast  AF-9) protein, a nonessential NuA4 histone
   acetyltransferase (HAT) subunit that also associates with the SWR1 complex,
   which deposits the histone H2A variant Htz1.
 - Yeast  something about silencing protein 5 (SAS5), a subunit of the SAS HAT
   complex.
 - Yeast transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 14 (TAF14), a component
   of the  NuA3  (SAS3)  HAT complex which is also associated with the SWI/SNF
   ATPase remodeling  complex  and  the  TFIIF  and  TFIID  RNA  polymerase II
   transcription complexes.
 - Human  Glioma-amplified sequence-41 (Gas41), a member of the TIP60 complex,
   which might be the human counterpart of the yeast NuA4 complex.
 - Human AF-9 protein.
 - Human ENL protein.

The profile we developed covers the entire YEATS domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
