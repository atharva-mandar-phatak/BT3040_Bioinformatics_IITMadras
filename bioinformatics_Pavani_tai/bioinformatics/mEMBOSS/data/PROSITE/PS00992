* Serum amyloid A proteins signature *
**************************************

The serum  amyloid  A  (SAA) proteins comprise a family of vertebrate proteins
that associate  predominantly  with high density lipoproteins (HDL) [1,2]. The
synthesis of  certain members of the family is greatly increased (as much as a
1000 fold)  in  inflammation;  thus  making  SAA a major acute phase reactant.
While the  major physiological function of SAA is unclear, prolonged elevation
of plasma  SAA  levels,  as  in  chronic  inflammation,  however, results in a
pathological condition,  called  amyloidosis,  which affects the liver, kidney
and spleen  and which is characterized by the highly insoluble accumulation of
SAA in these tissues.

SAA are proteins of about 110 amino acid residues. As a signature pattern,  we
selected the  most  highly  conserved  region, which is located in the central
part of the sequence.

-Consensus pattern: A-R-G-N-Y-[ED]-A-x-[QKR]-R-G-x-G-G-x-W-A
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: June 1994 / First entry.
