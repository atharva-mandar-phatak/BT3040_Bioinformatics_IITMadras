* WIF domain profile *
**********************

The WIF   domain  is  an  around  140-amino  acid  module  which  presents  an
independent folding  unit  in  receptor  molecules  that bind to palmitoylated
signaling proteins.  It has been identified in the extracellular region of the
Ryk receptor  tyrosine  kinases  and  in  the secreted Wnt-inhibitory-factor-1
(WIF-1) proteins.  As  the WIF module is both necessary and sufficient for Wnt
binding by  WIF-1,  it  has been proposed that the WIF module of Ryk receptors
might also  serve  to  bind  to  Wnt  proteins or related ligands. It has been
suggested that  the  WIF  domain  recognizes  and binds to Wnts that have been
activated by  palmitoylation.  The  WIF modules found in Ryk receptor tyrosine
kinases and  WIF-1  proteins  contain conserved sequence motifs, including two
conserved cysteines which form a disulfide bridge [1,2].

The fold  of  the  WIF  domain  is  related  to  the  immunoglobulin fold (see
<PDOC50835>). It  comprises  nine beta-strands and two alpha-helices, with two
of the  beta-strands  (6  and  9)  interrupted  by  four  and  six residues of
irregular secondary  structure,  respectively  (see  <PDB:2D3J>).  The N and C
termini are  located  at  opposite  ends  of the domain, in agreement with its
function as  a  structurally independent module in different sequence contexts
[2].

Some proteins known to contain a WIF module are listed below:

 - Mammalian  Ryk  proteins. Although mammalian Ryk proteins are found in most
   tissues, little  is  known  about  their  function. They are believed to be
   involved in cellular recognition processes.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans  lin-18, the Ryk homolog. It is required for cell-
   cuticle recognition.
 - Drosophila melanogaster derailed (drl) and doughnut (dnt) proteins. The drl
   protein plays  a  crucial  role  in  cell-recognition processes controlling
   nervous system  development  and muscle development. The dnt receptor has a
   related and significantly overlapping biochemical function.
 - Animal  WIF-1  proteins.  WIF-1s are secreted proteins, consisting of an N-
   terminal WIF  domain and five EGF-like repeats (see <PDOC00021>). They bind
   to wnt proteins and inhibit their activities.

The profile we developed covers the entire WIF domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
