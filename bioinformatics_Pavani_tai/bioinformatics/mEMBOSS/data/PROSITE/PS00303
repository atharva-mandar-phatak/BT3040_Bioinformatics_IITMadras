* S-100/ICaBP type calcium binding protein signature *
******************************************************

S-100 are small dimeric acidic calcium and zinc-binding  proteins [1] abundant
in the  brain.   They have two different types of calcium-binding sites: a low
affinity one  with  a  special  structure  and  a  'normal'  EF-hand type high
affinity site. The vitamin-D  dependent  intestinal  calcium-binding  proteins
(ICaBP or calbindin 9 Kd) also belong to this family  of proteins, but it does
not form  dimers.  In the past years the sequences of many new members of this
family have  been  determined  (for  reviews  see  [2,3,4]); in most cases the
function of  these  proteins  is  not yet known, although it is becoming clear
that they  are  involved  in  cell  growth  and  differentiation,  cell  cycle
regulation and metabolic control. These proteins are:

 - Calcyclin  (Prolactin  receptor  associated  protein (PRA); clatropin; 2a9;
   5B10; S100A6).
 - Calpactin I light chain (p10; p11; 42c; S100A10).
 - Calgranulin A (cystic fibrosis antigen (CFAg);  MIF related protein 8 (MRP-
   8); p8; S100A8).
 - Calgranulin B (MIF related protein 14 (MRP-14); p14; S100A9).
 - Calgranulin C.
 - Calgizzarin (S100C).
 - Placental  calcium-binding  protein  (CAPL)  (18a2;  peL98; 42a; p9K; MTS1;
   metastatin; S100A4).
 - Protein S-100D (S100A5).
 - Protein S-100E (S100A3).
 - Protein S-100L (CAN19; S100A2).
 - Placental protein S-100P (S100E).
 - Psoriasin (S100A7).
 - Chemotactic cytokine CP-10 [5].
 - Protein MRP-126 [6].
 - Trichohyalin  [7]. This is a large intermediate filament-associated protein
   that associates with keratin intermediate filaments (KIF); it contains a S-
   100 type domain in its N-terminal extremity.

A number of these proteins are known to bind calcium while others are not (p10
for example).  Our  EF-hand  detecting  pattern (see <PDOC00018>) will fail to
pick those  proteins  which  have  lost  their  calcium-binding properties. We
developed a  pattern  which  unambiguously picks up proteins belonging to this
family. This pattern spans the region of the EF-hand high  affinity  site  but
makes no assumptions on the calcium-binding properties of this site.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYW](2)-x(2)-[LKQ]-D-x(3)-[DN]-x(3)-[DNSG]-[FY]-x-
                    [ES]-[FYVC]-x(2)-[LIVMFS]-[LIVMF]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 5 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
