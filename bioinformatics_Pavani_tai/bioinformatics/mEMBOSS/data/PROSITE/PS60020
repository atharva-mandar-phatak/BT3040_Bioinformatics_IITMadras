* Janus-faced atracotoxin (J-ACTX) family signature *
*****************************************************

Janus-faced atracotoxins  (J-ACTXs)  form a family of insecticidal neurotoxins
isolated from  the venom of one of the world's most lethal arachnids, the Blue
mountains funnel-web  spider Hadronyche versuta. J-ACTXs are 36 or 37 residues
in length  with  eight  conserved cysteine residues involved in four disulfide
bonds, including  an extemely rare vicinal disulfide (a disulfide bond between
adjacent cysteine   residues)   that  has  been  shown  to  be  essential  for
insecticidal activity.  J-ACTXs  possess  two strikingly dissimilar faces. One
face presents  an  almost  contiguous charged surface, while the opposing face
containing the vicinal disulfide is devoid of ionizable side chains [1].

J-ACTX family  proteins  have a [C-C-CC-CC-C-C] cysteine arrangement, which is
similar to  that  of the I-superfamily conotoxins (see <PDOC60004>). The three
dimensional structure   of   J-ACTXs   possesses   a   knottin  scaffold  (see
<PDOC60004>) [E1]  and  III-IV  pair  of  cysteine  residues (as marked '#' in
schematic representation)  involved  in  a  additional  disulfide linkage. The
cysteine knot  motif  in  J-ACTXs  provides  high  stability and maintains the
tertiary structure.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in disulfide bond.
'#': Cysteines  three and four are connected to each other through a disulfide
     bond.

Our signature  pattern  for  J-ACTXs  contains  the  eight conserved cysteines
involved in disulfide bonds.

-Conserved pattern: C-{C}(6)-C-x(2)-C-C-x-C-C-x(4)-C-x(9,10)-C
                    [The 8 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
