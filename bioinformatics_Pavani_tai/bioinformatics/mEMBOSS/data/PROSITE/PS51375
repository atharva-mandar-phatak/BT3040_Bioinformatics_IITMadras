* Pentatricopeptide (PPR) repeat profile *
******************************************

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are characterized by tandem repeats of
a  degenerate  35 amino  acid  motif  [1]. Most of PPR proteins have roles in
mitochondria   or   plastid.  PPR  repeats  were  discovered  while  screening
Arabidopsis  proteins  for  those  predicted to be targeted to mitochondria or
chloroplast  [1,2].  Some  of these proteins have been shown to play a role in
post-transcriptional  processes  within  organelles and they are thought to be
sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins [3,4,5]. Plant genomes have between one
hundred  to five hundred PPR genes per genome whereas non-plant genomes encode
two to six PPR proteins.

Although  no PPR structures are yet known, the motif is predicted to fold into
a  helix-turn-helix  structure similar to those found in the tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) family (see <PDOC50005>) [1].

The  plant PPR protein family has been divided in two subfamilies on the basis
of their motif content and organization [6,7]:

 - Plant  P-subfamily.  In  the  P-subfamily  the  35  amino  acid repeats are
   adjacent  to  each  other (i.e. in tandem repeats). This subfamily contains
   proteins  involved in RNA processing (high chlorophyll fluorescence protein
   152),  translation (chloroplast  RNA processing protein 1), splicing (PPR4)
   and RNA stability (ribosome release factor 1b, PGR3).
 - Plant  combinatorial  and  modular  proteins  (PCMP) subfamily. In the PCMP
   subfamily  classical  35  amino  acid repeats are found in association with
   shorter  (31  amino  acids)  and  longer  (36  amino  acids)  repeats. This
   subfamily  contains  proteins  involved  in  RNA editing (chlororespiratory
   reduction proteins 4 and 21) and RNA processing (CRR2, RF1).

Some non-plant PPR proteins are listed below:

 - Mammalian  leucine-rich PPR motif-containing (LPPRC) protein. It may play a
   role  in  translation  or stability of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX) subunits.
 - Drosophila  bicoid  mRNA  stability factor (BSF). BSF binds specifically to
   bicoid  mRNA  3'-untranslated  region.   BSF  plays  a  role  in bicoid RNA
   stabilization.
 - Yeast   Pet309  protein.  It  is  involved  in  translation  of  the  yeast
   mitochondrial  COX1  gene,  which  encodes  subunit  I  of the cytochrome c
   oxidase. Pet309 protein is also involved in stabilization of the COX1 mRNA.
 - Yeast  ATPase  expression protein 3 (Aep3). It stabilizes the mitochondrial
   bicistronic   mRNA   encoding   ATP6   and   ATP8,   2   subunits   of  the
   proton-translocating ATP synthase.

The profile we developed covers the entire PPR repeat.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
