* Hemolysin-type calcium-binding region signature *
***************************************************

Gram-negative bacteria  produce  a  number of proteins which are secreted into
the growth medium by a mechanism that  does  not  require a cleaved N-terminal
signal sequence. These proteins, while having different functions, seem [1] to
share two properties: they bind calcium  and they contain a variable number of
tandem repeats consisting of a nine amino acid motif rich in glycine, aspartic
acid and asparagine. It has been shown [2] that such  a  domain is involved in
the binding of calcium ions in a parallel beta roll structure.    The proteins
which are currently known to belong to this category are:

 - Hemolysins from  various  species  of bacteria.   Bacterial  hemolysins are
   exotoxins that attack blood  cell  membranes  and cause  cell rupture.  The
   hemolysins which are known to contain such a domain are those from: E. coli
   (gene hlyA),   A. pleuropneumoniae  (gene appA),   A. actinomycetemcomitans
   and P. haemolytica (leukotoxin) (gene lktA).
 - Cyclolysin from Bordetella pertussis (gene cyaA). A multifunctional protein
   which is both an adenylate cyclase and a hemolysin.
 - Extracellular zinc proteases: serralysin (EC 3.4.24.40) from Serratia, prtB
   and prtC from Erwinia chrysanthemi and aprA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - Nodulation protein nodO from Rhizobium leguminosarum.

We derived a signature pattern from conserved positions in the sequence of the
calcium-binding domain.

-Consensus pattern: D-x-[LI]-x(4)-G-x-D-x-[LI]-x-G-G-x(3)-D
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: This pattern  is found once in nodO and the extracellular proteases but
 up to 5 times in some hemolysin/cyclolysins.
