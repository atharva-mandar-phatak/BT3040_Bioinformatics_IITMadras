* FIP-RBD domain profile *
**************************

The Rab11 GTPase regulates recycling of internalized plasma membrane receptors
and is  essential for completion of cytokinesis. A family of Rab11 interacting
proteins (FIPs)   that   conserve   a   C-terminal  Rab-binding  domain  (RBD)
selectively recognize  the  active form of Rab11. FIPs are diverse in sequence
length and  composition  toward  their  N-termini,  presumably  a feature that
underpins their  specific  roles  in  Rab11-mediated vesicle trafficking. They
have been  divided  into three subfamilies (classe I, II, and III)on the basis
of domain  architecture.  Class I FIPs comprises a subfamily of three proteins
(Rip11/pp75/FIP5, Rab-coupling  protein  (RCP),  and  FIP2) that possess an N-
terminal C2  domain  (see  <PDOC00380>),  localize to recycling endosomes, and
regulate plasma  membrane  recycling.  The  class II subfamily consists of two
proteins (FIP3/eferin/arfophilin   and   FIP4)   with  tandem  EF  hands  (see
<PDOC00018>) and  a  proline-rich  region. Class II FIPs localize to recycling
endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and have been implicated in the regulation
of membrane  trafficking  during cytokinesis. The class III subfamily consists
of a  single protein, FIP1, which does not contain obvious homology domains or
motifs other than the FIP-RBD [1,2,3,4].

The FIB-RBD  domain  consists of an N-terminal long alpha-helix, followed by a
90° bend  at a conserved proline residue, a 3(10) helix and a C-terminal short
beta-strand, adopting  an  "L"  shape  (see  <PDB:2D7C>). The long alpha-helix
forms a  parallel  coiled-coil homodimer that symmetrically interacts with two
Rab11 molecules   on  both  sides,  forming  a  quaternary  Rab11-(FIP)2-Rab11
complex. The Rab11-interacting region of FIP-RBD is confined to the C-terminal
24 amino  acids,  which  cover the C-terminal half of the long alpha-helix and
the short beta-strand [1,2,3,4].

The profile we developed covers the entire FIP-RBD domain.
