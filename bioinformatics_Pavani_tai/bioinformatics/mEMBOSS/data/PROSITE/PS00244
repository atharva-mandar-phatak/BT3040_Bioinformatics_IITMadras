* Photosynthetic reaction center proteins signature *
*****************************************************

In the  photosynthetic   reaction  center  of purple bacteria, two  homologous
integral membrane proteins, L(ight) and M(edium), are known to be essential to
the  light-mediated  water-splitting process.     In  the  photosystem  II  of
eukaryotic chloroplasts two  related  proteins are involved: the D1 (psbA) and
D2 proteins (psbD).     These four types of protein  probably evolved  from  a
common ancestor [see 1,2 for recent reviews].

We  developed a  signature  pattern  which  include  two  conserved  histidine
residues. In  L and M chains, the first histidine is a ligand of the magnesium
ion of  the  special  pair  bacteriochlorophyll,  the  second is a ligand of a
ferrous non-heme iron atom. In photosystem II these two histidines are thought
to play a similar role.

-Consensus pattern: [NQH]-x(4)-P-x-H-x(2)-[SAG]-x(11)-[SAGC]-x-H-[SAG](2)
                    [The first H is a magnesium ligand]
                    [The second H is a iron ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for broad bean psbA which has Gln instead of the second His.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
