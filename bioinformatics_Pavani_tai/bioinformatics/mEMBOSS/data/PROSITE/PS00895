* 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase signature *
************************************************

3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.31) catalyzes the  NAD-dependent,
reversible oxidation of 3-hydroxbutyrate to methylmalonate [1]. In eukaryotes,
it is a homodimeric mitochondrial protein  involved in valine catabolism.   In
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  [2]  (gene  mmsB), it is involved in the distal valine
metabolic pathway.

The sequence   of   3-hydroxyisobutyrate  dehydrogenase  from  eukaryotic  and
prokaryotic sources  show  that this enzyme has been well conserved throughout
evolution. The following proteins are evolutionary related to 3-hydroxyisobut-
yrate dehydrogenase:

 - Escherichia  coli  2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase (EC 1.1.1.60) (genes
   garR and glxR).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygbJ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihU.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yfjR.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ykwC.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv0770.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0229.

As a  signature  pattern, we  selected  a highly conserved glycine-rich region
located at  the  proteins'  N-terminus.  This  region  is probably involved in
binding NAD.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY](2)-G-L-G-x-[MQ]-G-x(2)-[MA]-[SAV]-x-[SNHR]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
