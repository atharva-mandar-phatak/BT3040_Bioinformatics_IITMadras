* Casein kinase II regulatory subunit signature *
*************************************************

Casein kinase  II  (CK-2)  [1]  is  an  ubiquitous eukaryotic serine/threonine
protein kinase which is found both in the cytoplasm and the  nucleus and whose
substrates are  numerous.  It  generally  phosphorylates  Ser  or  Thr  at the
N-terminal of stretch of acidic residues (see <PDOC00006>). CK-2 exists as  an
heterotetramer composed of  two catalytic  subunits (alpha) and two regulatory
subunits (beta). In most species there are two closely related isoforms of the
catalytic subunit: alpha  and  alpha'. Some species, such as fungi and plants,
express two    forms of  regulatory subunits: beta and beta'. The beta subunit
plays a  complex  role in regulating the basal catalytic activity of the alpha
subunit. The beta subunit is a highly conserved protein of about  25  Kd  that
contains, in its central section, a cysteine-rich motif that could be involved
in binding  a  metal such as zinc [2]. We have used this region as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: C-P-x-[LIVMYAT]-x-C-x(5)-[LI]-P-[LIVMCA]-G-x(9)-V-[KRM]-
                    x(2)-C-[PA]-x-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
