*****************************************
* glpT family of transporters signature *
*****************************************

The following  proteins  involved in the uptake of phosphorylated metabolites,
are evolutionary related [1,2]:

 - Escherichia coli,  Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae glycerol-3-
   phosphate transporter (gene glpT).
 - Salmonella typhimurium phosphoglycerate transporter (gene pgtP).
 - Escherichia coli and  Salmonella typhimurium hexose-6-phosphate transporter
   (gene uhpT).
 - Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium protein uhpC. UhpC is necessary
   for the expression of uhpT and seems to  act  jointly with the uhpB sensor/
   kinase protein.
 - Human glucose 6-phosphate translocase [3].

These proteins of about 50 Kd apparently contain  12 transmembrane regions. As
a signature pattern we selected a conserved region in their central section.

-Consensus pattern: [QEK]-[RF]-G-x(3)-[GSA]-[LIVF]-[WL]-[NS]-x-[SA]-[HM]-N-
                    [LIV]-[GA]-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1999 / Pattern and text revised.
