***********************************************************

Isocitrate dehydrogenase  (IDH) [1,2] is an  important  enzyme of carbohydrate
metabolism which catalyzes  the  oxidative  decarboxylation of isocitrate into
alpha-ketoglutarate. IDH is either dependent on NAD+ (EC 1.1.1.41) or on NADP+
(EC 1.1.1.42). In eukaryotes there are at least three isozymes of IDH: two are
located in  the  mitochondrial matrix  (one NAD+-dependent,  the  other NADP+-
dependent), while the  third  one  (also NADP+-dependent) is  cytoplasmic.  In
Escherichia coli the  activity  of  a  NADP+-dependent form  of  the enzyme is
controlled by the phosphorylation of a serine residue; the phosphorylated form
of IDH is completely inactivated.

3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.85) (IMDH) [3,4] catalyzes the third
step in the  biosynthesis of leucine in  bacteria  and   fungi, the  oxidative
decarboxylation of 3-isopropylmalate into 2-oxo-4-methylvalerate.

Tartrate dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.93) [5] catalyzes the reduction of tartrate
to oxaloglycolate.

These enzymes are evolutionary related [1,3,4,5]. The best conserved region of
these enzymes is  a glycine-rich stretch of residues located in the C-terminal
section. We have used this region as a signature pattern.
