* Hydrogenases expression/synthesis hypA family signature *
***********************************************************

Bacterial membrane-bound  nickel-dependent  hydrogenases  requires a number of
accessory proteins  which  are involved in their maturation. The exact role of
these proteins  is  not  yet  clear,  but  some  seem  to  be required for the
incorporation of  the  nickel  ions  [1,2]. One of these proteins is generally
known as  hypA.  It is a protein of about 12 to 14 Kd that contains, in its C-
terminal region four conserved cysteines that may bind nickel.

Escherichia coli  has  two proteins that belong to this family: hypA and hybF.
Homolog have also been found in the genome of many archaea.

We developed  a  signature  pattern  that  starts about 45 residues before the
first conserved cysteine and that ends with the second one.

-Consensus pattern: [GS]-x(4)-[LIVMT]-x(4)-[LIVMF]-x(2)-[CSAM]-[LMFY]-x(6)-
                    [STC]-x(4,5)-[PAC]-x-[LIVMF]-x-[LIVMF]-x(8)-C-x(1,2)-[CH]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
