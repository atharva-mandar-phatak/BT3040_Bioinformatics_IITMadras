* Bacterial type II secretion system protein D signature *
**********************************************************

A number  of  bacterial  proteins,  some  of  which  are involved in a general
secretion pathway  (GSP) for the export  of  proteins (also called the type II
pathway) [1 to 5], have been found to be evolutionary related.  These proteins
are listed below:

 - The    'D'  protein from the GSP operon of: Aeromonas (gene exeD);  Erwinia
   (gene outD);  Escherichia  coli  (gene  yheF),  Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene
   pulD); Pseudomonas  aeruginosa (gene xcpQ); Vibrio cholerae (gene epsD) and
   Xanthomonas campestris (gene xpsD).
 - comE from Haemophilus influenzae, involved in competence (DNA uptake).
 - pilQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  which  is essential for the formation of
   the pili.
 - hofQ (hopQ) from Escherichia coli.
 - hrpH  from  Pseudomonas  syringae,  which is involved in the secretion of a
   proteinaceous elicitor of the hypersensitivity response in plants.
 - hrpA1  from  Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which is also involved
   in the hypersensitivity response.
 - mxiD  from  Shigella flexneri which is involved in the secretion of the Ipa
   invasins  which  are  necessary  for  penetration  of intestinal epithelial
   cells.
 - omc from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
 - yssC from Yersinia enterocolitica virulence plasmid pYV,  which seems to be
   required for the export of the Yop virulence proteins.
 - The  gpIV  protein from filamentous phages such as f1, ike, or m13. GpIV is
   said to be involved in phage assembly and morphogenesis.

These proteins all seem to start with a signal  sequence and are thought to be
integral proteins in the outer membrane.  As a signature pattern we selected a
conserved region in the C-terminal section of these proteins.

-Consensus pattern: [GRH]-[DEQKG]-[STVM]-[LIVMA](3)-[GA]-G-[LIVMFY]-x(11)-
                    [LIVM]-P-[LIVMFYWGS]-[LIVMF]-[GSAE]-x-[LIVMS]-P-[LIVMFYW]-
                    [LIVMFYWS]-x(2,3)-[LV]-[FK]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for hrpH and omc.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
