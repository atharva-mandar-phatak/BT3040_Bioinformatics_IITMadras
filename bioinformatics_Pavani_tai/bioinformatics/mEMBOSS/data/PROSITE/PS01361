* Zinc finger Dof-type signature and profile *
**********************************************

The  Dof (DNA-binding with one finger) Cys2/Cys2-type zing finger is an around
50  amino  acid  motif  found  in  plant transcription factors involved in the
regulation  of  various  processes.  The  arrangement  of  cysteines  has some
significant  ressemblance  to  GATA  (see  <PDOC00300>)  and  steroid  hormone
receptor  (see  <PDOC00031>) zinc fingers [1]. Like other zinc fingers the Dof
domain  has  a  dual activity: it binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner with
the core binding site formed by the AAAG sequence [1] and it can also mediates
protein-protein interaction (see below).

Some of the proteins known to contain a Dof zinc finger are listed below:

 - Maize ZmDof1 protein, an activator of various light-regulated genes.
 - Pumpkin ascorbate oxidase promoter-binding protein (AOBP).
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  OBF  binding protein 1 (OBP1). It interacts with the
   basic leucine  zipper  transcription  factors OBF4 and OBF5 through its Dof
   zinc finger to enhance their DNA binding to OCS element sequences [2].
 - Arabidopsis   thaliana  Dof  affecting  germination  1  protein  (DAG1),  a
   transcription  factor specifically involved in the maternal control of seed
   germination.
 - Tobacco  NtBBF1  protein,  a  regulatory factor of the auxin-inducible rolB
   gene.
 - Maize  PBF1 protein, a  transcription factor controlling endosperm specific
   expression of storage proteins.

The  pattern  we  developed  covers  the whole zinc finger and the first eight
amino  acids  of  the  conserved  basic  C-terminal tail essential for the DNA
binding activity [3]. We also developed a profile that spans the whole domain.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x(7)-[CS]-x(13)-C-x(2)-C-x-R-x-W-T-x-G-G
