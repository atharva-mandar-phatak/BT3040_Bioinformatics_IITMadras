* Tudor domain profile *
************************

The Tudor  domain  is  a  domain  of  around 50-70 amino acids which was first
identified as a repeat present in 10 copies in Drosophila Tudor protein [1,2].
The Tudor domain is found in one or several copies in many eukaryotic proteins
that colocalize   with  ribonucleoprotein  or  single-stranded  DNA-associated
complexes in  the  nucleus, in the mitochondrial membrane, or at kinetochores.
The Tudor  domain  can  be  found in association with other domains, such as a
staphylococcal nuclease   (SN)-fold  (see  <PDOC00865>),  a  OTU  domain  (see
<PDOC50802>), a  KH  domain (see <PDOC50084>), a DEAD/DEAH box helicase domain
(see <PDOC00039>)   or   a  coiled-coil  domain.  An  insufficient  amount  of
functional information  concerning  the  proteins containing a Tudor domain is
currently available from which to ascribe putative functions to Tudor domains.
However, it   is   likely  that  Tudor  domains  function  as  protein-protein
interaction motifs  during  RNA metabolism and/or transport and do not bind to
RNA directly [1,3,4].

The resolution  of  the  solution  structure  of the Tudor domain of human SMN
revealed that  the  Tudor domain forms a strongly bent antiparallel beta-sheet
with five  strands  forming  a  barrel-like  fold.  The  structure  exhibits a
conserved negatively  charged  surface  that interacts with the C-terminal Arg
and Gly-rich tails of the spliceosomal Sm D1 and D3 proteins [4].

Some proteins known to contain a Tudor domain are listed below:

 - Drosophila  Tudor, a protein required during oogenesis for the formation of
   primordial germ cells and for normal abdominal segmentation.
 - Drosophila  Homeless  (HLS), a protein belonging to the DE-H family of RNA-
   dependent ATPases  that  is required for RNA localization during oogenesis.
   HLS might  function during the processing of pre-mRNA whose products direct
   microtubules organization, which is required for mRNA transport.
 - Drosophila  ovarian tumor protein (OTU). OTU is required at multiple stages
   of oogenesis  and  the  Tudor  domain is required for its early function. A
   portion of OTU cofractionates with mRNA/protein complexes (mRNPs) [5].
 - Mammalian survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). SMN participates in small
   nuclear ribonucleoprotein  (snRNP)  particles assembly in the cytoplasm and
   may also affect splicing more directly in the nucleus. In human, defects of
   the SMN  protein  are  associated  with  spinal  muscular  atrophy (SMA), a
   disease in  which the anterior horn cells in the spinal corn die, resulting
   in progressive  muscle  weakness  and  ultimately,  in  some  cases, in the
   inability to breathe and swallow.
 - Human  A-kinase  anchor  protein  1  (AKAP1).  It  binds  to  type I and II
   regulatory subunits of protein kinase a and anchors them to the cytoplasmic
   face of  the mitochondrial outer membrane. An alternatively spliced version
   of AKAP1   (S-AKAP84)   participates   in   spermiogenesis,   probably   by
   facilitating ordering of spermatid mitochondria.
 - Human  p100, a nuclear protein that coactivates gene expression mediated by
   the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2). The p100 protein is also
   able to bind single-stranded DNA.
 - Human Tudor and KH domain-containing protein (TDRKH) [6].
 - Rat Tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE 2 (Trap). Trap contains five Tudor
   domains and  interacts  with  the  N-terminal  domain  of  PCTAIRE 1 and 2,
   members of  Cdk-related  kinases  which  is highly expressed in the nervous
   system.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C56G2.1.
 - Rice  Rp120, a protein that binds to a wide range of mRNAs expressed during
   seed development and is associated with the cytoskeleton [7].
