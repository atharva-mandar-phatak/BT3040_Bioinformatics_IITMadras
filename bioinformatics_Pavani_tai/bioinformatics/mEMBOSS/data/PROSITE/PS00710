* Phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase phosphoserine signature *
*********************************************************************

 - Phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2) (PGM). PGM  is  an  enzyme  responsible for
   the conversion  of  D-glucose 1-phosphate into  D-glucose 6-phosphate.  PGM
   participates in both the breakdown and synthesis of glucose [1].
 - Phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8) (PMM).  PMM  is  an enzyme  responsible for
   the conversion of D-mannose 1-phosphate into D-mannose 6-phosphate.  PMM is
   required for  different biosynthetic pathways in bacteria.  For example, in
   enterobacteria  such  as Escherichia coli  there  are  two  different genes
   coding for this  enzyme:  rfbK  which is involved in the synthesis of the O
   antigen of lipopolysaccharide and cpsG  which is required for the synthesis
   of the M antigen capsular polysaccharide [2]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PMM
   (gene algC) is  involved  in the biosynthesis of the alginate layer [3] and
   in Xanthomonas campestris (gene xanA) it is involved in the biosynthesis of
   xanthan [4].  In  Rhizobium strain ngr234 (gene noeK) it is involved in the
   biosynthesis of the nod factor.
 - Phosphoacetylglucosamine  mutase  (EC  5.4.2.3)  which converts N-acetyl-D-
   glucosamine 1-phosphate into the 6-phosphate isomer.

The  catalytic  mechanism  of  both  PGM  and  PMM involves the formation of a
phosphoserine intermediate [1]. The sequence around the serine residue is well
conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

In addition to PGM and PMM there  are  at least three uncharacterized proteins
that belong to this family [5,6]:

 - Urease operon protein ureC from Helicobacter pylori.
 - Escherichia coli protein mrsA.
 - Paramecium   tetraurelia   parafusin,  a  phosphoglycoprotein  involved  in
   exocytosis.
 - A Methanococcus vannielii hypothetical protein  in the 3'region of the gene
   for ribosomal protein S10.

-Consensus pattern: [GSA]-[LIVMF]-x-[LIVM]-[ST]-[PGA]-S-H-[NIC]-P
                    [S is the phosphoserine residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: PMM from fungi do not belong to this family.

-Last update: December 2001 / Pattern and text revised.
