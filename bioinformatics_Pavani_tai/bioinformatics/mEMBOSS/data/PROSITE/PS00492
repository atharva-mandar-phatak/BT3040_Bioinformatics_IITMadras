* Clusterin signatures *
************************

Clusterin is a vertebrate glycoprotein [1] which is known by various names:

 - In Human as complement-associated  protein SP-40,40,  complement  cytolysis
   inhibitor (CLI), NA1/NA2, and apolipoprotein J (Apo-J).
 - In rat as sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2), dimeric acid glycoprotein (DAG),
   and Testosterone Repressed Prostate Message-2 (TRPM-2).
 - In bovine as glycoprotein III (GP-III).
 - In dog as glycoprotein 80 (gp-80).
 - In quail as protein T64.

The exact function  of  this  protein  is  not  yet  clear,  it is known to be
expressed in a variety of tissues and  it  seems  to be able to bind to cells,
membranes, and hydrophobic proteins.  It has  been  associated with programmed
cell death.

Clusterin is  synthesized as a precursor polypeptide of about 400  amino acids
which is post-translationally cleaved to form two subunits (of about 200 amino
acids each).  The  two  subunits are linked by five disulfide bonds to form an
antiparallel ladder-like structure [2]. In  each of  the  mature  subunits the
five cysteines that are  involved  in disulfide bonds are clustered in domains
of about 30 amino acids located in the central part of the subunits.

We have developed two signature patterns for clusterin, each  of them contains
three cysteines, the first pattern is  derived  from  the  N-terminal  subunit
cluster and the second pattern is derived from the C-terminal subunit cluster.

-Consensus pattern: C-K-P-C-L-K-x-T-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Consensus pattern: C-L-[RK]-M-[RK]-x-[EQ]-C-[ED]-K-C
                    [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
