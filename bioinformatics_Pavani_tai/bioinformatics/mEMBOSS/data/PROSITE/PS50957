* Josephin domain profile *
***************************

The Josephin  domain  is  an  eukaryotic protein module of about 180 residues,
which occurs  in  stand-alone form in Josephin-like proteins, and as an amino-
terminal domain  associated  with  two  or  three  copies  of  the  ubiquitin-
interacting motif  (UIM) (see <PDOC50330>) in ataxin 3-like proteins. Although
it has originally been proposed that the Josephin domain could be an all-alpha
helical domain  distantly  related  to  ENTH  (see  <PDOC50942>)  and VHS (see
<PDOC50179>) domains  involved  in membrane trafficking and regulatory adaptor
function [1],  it  is now believed that it is a mainly alpha helical cysteine-
protease domain  predicted  to  be  active against ubiquitin chains or related
substrates [2,3].

The Josephin domain contains two conserved histidines and one cysteine that is
required for the ubiquitin protease activity [2,3].

Some proteins known to contain a Josephin domain are listed below:

 - Animal  Machado-Joseph  disease protein 1 (Ataxin 3). It interacts with key
   regulators (CBP,   p300   and   PCAF)   of   transcription   and  represses
   transcription.
 - Plant Machado-Joseph disease-like protein (MJD1a-like) (Ataxin 3 homolog).
 - Mammalian Josephin 1 and 2.
 - Drosophila melanogaster Josephin-like protein.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana Josephin-like protein.

The profile we developed spans the entire Josephin domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
