*****************************
* GTP1/OBG family signature *
*****************************

A widespread  family  of  GTP-binding proteins has been recently characterized
[1,2]. This family currently includes:

 - Mouse and Xenopus protein DRG.
 - Human protein DRG2.
 - Drosophila protein 128up.
 - Fission yeast protein gtp1.
 - A Halobacterium cutirubrum hypothetical protein in a ribosomal protein gene
   cluster.
 - Bacillus subtilis  protein obg. Obg  has been experimentally shown to  bind
   GTP.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhbZ.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0877.
 - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG384.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL036c (FUN11).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR173w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C02F5.3.

The function of the proteins that belong to this family is not yet known. They
are polypeptides of about  40 to 48 Kd which contain  the  five small sequence
elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins [3]. As a signature pattern we
selected the region that correspond to the ATP/GTP B motif (also called G-3 in
GTP-binding proteins).

-Consensus pattern: D-[LIVMA]-P-G-[LIVM](2)-[DEYPKQV]-[GN]-A-x(2)-G-x-G
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised.
