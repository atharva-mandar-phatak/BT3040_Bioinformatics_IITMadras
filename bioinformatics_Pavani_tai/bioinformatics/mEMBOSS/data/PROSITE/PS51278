* Glutamine amidotransferase type 2 domain profile *
****************************************************

A  large group of biosynthetic enzymes are able to catalyze the removal of the
ammonia group from glutamine and then to transfer this group to a substrate to
form  a  new  carbon-nitrogen  group.  This  catalytic  activity  is  known as
glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) (EC 2.4.2.-) [1]. The GATase domain exists
either  as  a separate polypeptidic subunit or as part of a larger polypeptide
fused  in  different  ways  to  a  synthase  domain.  On the basis of sequence
similarities two classes of GATase domains have been identified [2,3]: class-I
(also  known as trpG-type or triad) (see <PDOC00405>) and class-II (also known
as  purF-type  or Ntn). Class-II (or type 2) GATase domains have been found in
the following enzymes:

 - Amido   phosphoribosyltransferase  (glutamine   phosphoribosylpyrophosphate
   amidotransferase) (EC 2.4.2.14).  An enzyme which  catalyzes the first step
   in purine biosynthesis,  the transfer  of the ammonia group of glutamine to
   PRPP to form 5-phosphoribosylamine (gene purF in bacteria, ADE4 in yeast).
 - Glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate  aminotransferase   (EC 2.6.1.16).   This
   enzyme catalyzes a  key reaction in amino sugar synthesis, the formation of
   glucosamine 6-phosphate from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine  (gene glmS
   in Escherichia coli, nodM in Rhizobium, GFA1 in yeast).
 - Asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.4).  This enzyme is
   responsible for the synthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine.
 - Glutamate  synthase  (gltS),  an  enzyme  which participates in the ammonia
   assimilation   process  by  catalyzing  the  formation  of  glutamate  from
   glutamine  and  2-oxoglutarate.  Glutamate  synthase  is  a  multicomponent
   iron-sulfur  flavoprotein  and  three  types  occur  which  use a different
   electron   donor:   NADPH-dependent   gltS  (large  chain)   (EC 1.4.1.13),
   ferredoxin-dependent   gltS   (EC 1.4.7.1)  and   NADH-dependent  gltS  (EC
   1.4.1.14) [4].

The active site is formed by a cysteine present at the N-terminal extremity of
the  mature form of all these enzymes [5-8]. Two other conserved residues, Asn
and  Gly,  form  an  oxyanion hole for stabilization of the formed tetrahedral
intermediate.  An  insert  of  ~120  residues  can occur between the conserved
regions  [4].  In  some  class-II GATases (for example in Bacillus subtilis or
chicken  amido  phosphoribosyltransferase)  the  enzyme  is synthesized with a
short  propeptide  which  is  cleaved  off  post-translationally by a proposed
autocatalytic  mechanism.  Nuclear-encoded  Fd-dependent  gltS  have  a longer
propeptide which may contain a chloroplast-targeting peptide in additon to the
propeptide that is excised on enzyme activation [4].

The   3-D   structure  of  the  GATase  type  2  domain  forms  a  four  layer
alpha/beta/beta/alpha  architecture  (see <PDB:1LM1>) which consists of a fold
similar  to  the  N-terminal  nucleophile  (Ntn)  hydrolases.  These  have the
capacity   for  nucleophilic  attack  and  the  possibility  of  autocatalytic
processing.  The  N-terminal  position  and  the  folding of the catalytic Cys
differ  strongly  from  the  Cys-His-Glu  triad which forms the active site of
GATases of type 1 (see <PDOC00405>).

The profile we developed covers the entire GATase type 2 domain.
