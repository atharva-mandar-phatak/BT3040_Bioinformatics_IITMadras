* Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase signature *
**************************************************

Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.1.11) (ASD) catalyzes the second
step in  the  common  biosynthetic pathway leading from Asp to diaminopimelate
and Lys, to Met, and to Thr; the NADP-dependent reductive dephosphorylation of
L-aspartyl phosphate  to  L-aspartate-semialdehyde. In bacteria and fungi, ASD
is a  protein  of  about  40  Kd  (340  to 370 residues) whose sequence is not
extremely well conserved [1]. A conserved cysteine residue has been implicated
as important for the catalytic activity [2].

The region  of  conservation around the active site residue is too small to be
used as  as  signature  pattern.  We  have used another more conserved region,
located in the last third of the sequence, and which contains both a conserved
cysteine as well as an histidine.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[SADN]-x(2)-C-x-R-[LIVM]-x(4)-[GSC]-H-[STA]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
-Last update: November 1995 / First entry.
