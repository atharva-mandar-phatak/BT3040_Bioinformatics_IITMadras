* DhaL domain profile *
***********************

Dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinases are a family of sequence-conserved enzymes that
phosphorylate dihydroxyacetone,  glyceraldehyde  and other short-chain ketoses
and aldoses.  They  can  be divided into two groups according to the source of
high-energy phosphate  that  they  utilize,  either ATP or phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP). The  ATP-dependent  forms  are  the two-domain Dha kinases (DAK), which
occur in  animals,  plants  and  eubacteria. They consist of a Dha binding (K)
(see <PDOC51481>) and an ATP binding (L) domain. The PEP-dependent forms occur
only in eubacteria and a few archaebacteria and consist of three subunits. Two
subunits, DhaK  and DhaL, are homologous to the K and L domains. Intriguingly,
the ADP  moiety  is not exchanged for ATP but remains permanently bound to the
DhaL subunit  where it is rephosphorylated in situ by the third subunit, DhaM,
which is  homologous  to  the  IIA  domain  of  the mannose transporter of the
bacterial PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (see <PDOC00528>) [1,2].

The DhaL  domain  consists  of eight antiparallel alpha-helices arranged in an
up-and-down geometry and aligned on a circle (see <PDB:1UN8>). This results in
the formation  of  a  helix  barrel  enclosing  a deep pocket. The helices are
amphipathic with  the  hydrophobic side chains directed into the pocket of the
barrel and with the polar residues exposed. The nucleotide is bound on the top
of the barrel [1,3].

The DhaL  alpha helix barrel fold appears not only as C-terminal domain in Dha
kinases but  also as N-terminal domain in a family of two-domain proteins with
unknown function.  One  representative  example  is YfhG of Lactococcus lactis
[3].

The profile we developed covers the entire DhaL domain.
