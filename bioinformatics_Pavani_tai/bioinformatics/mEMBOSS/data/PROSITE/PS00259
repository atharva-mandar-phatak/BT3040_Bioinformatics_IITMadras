* Gastrin / cholecystokinin family signature *
**********************************************

Gastrin and cholecystokinin  (CCK)  [1,2] are  structurally  and  functionally
related  peptide  hormones that  function  as  hormonal regulators  of various
digestive processes and feeding behaviors .   They are known to induce gastric
secretion,  stimulate  pancreatic  secretion,  increase  blood circulation and
water secretion  in  the stomach  and  intestine, and stimulate  smooth muscle
contraction.   Originally found  in the gut, these  hormones have  since  been
shown to be present in various parts of the nervous  system.   Like many other
active peptides  they  are synthesized  as larger protein precursors that  are
enzymatically  converted to their  mature forms.   They  are found in  several
molecular forms  due  to  tissue-specific  post-translational  processing.   A
number of other peptides are known to belong to the same family:

 - Caerulein [3], an  amphibian  skin  peptide,  with  a  biological  activity
   similar to that of CCK or gastrin.   There are different types of caerulein
   precursors [4] in  which a  single  or up to four copies of the peptide are
   present.
 - Leukosulfakinin I and II (LSK) [5,6] are peptides, isolated from cockroach,
   that change the frequency and amplitude of contractions of the hindgut.
 - Drosulfakinins I and II [7]  are  putative  CCK-homologs  from  Drosophila.
   Those two  peptides are  part  of a  precursor  sequence  that was isolated
   using a probe based on the sequence of CCK and LSK.
 - A chicken antrum peptide [8]  which is  a  potent stimulus of avian gastric
   acid but not of pancreatic secretion.
 - Cionin [9], a neuropeptide from the protochordate Ciona intestinalis.

The biological activity of gastrin and CCK is associated with the last five C-
terminal  residues.  One  or two  positions  downstream, there  is a conserved
sulfated tyrosine residue.  The signature pattern developed for this family of
peptides includes  the  biologically active C-terminal sequence as well as the
sulfated tyrosine.

-Consensus pattern: Y-x(0,1)-[GD]-[WH]-M-[DR]-F
                    [Y is sulfated]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The residues in positions 4 and 6  of the pattern are  respectively Trp
 and Asp in vertebrate peptides, and His and Arg in insect peptides.
