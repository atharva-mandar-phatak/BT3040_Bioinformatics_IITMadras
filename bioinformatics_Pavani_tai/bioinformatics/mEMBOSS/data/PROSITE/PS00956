*********************************
* Fungal hydrophobins signature *
*********************************

The surface  of  many  fungal  spores  is covered by a hydrophobic sheath, the
rodlet layer whose main component is a protein known as the rodlet protein [1,
2]. The  rodlet   proteins  of  Neurospora  crassa (gene  eas)  and Emericella
nidulans (gene  rodA)  are  evolutionary related to proteins found in the cell
wall of   fruiting   bodies   of   the  mushroom  Schizophyllum  commune  [3].
Collectively, these    low-molecular-weight,    cysteine-rich   (8   conserved
cysteines), hydrophobic proteins, are known as hydrophobins.

As a  signature  pattern  we  selected  a conserved region that contains three
cysteines and which is located in the C-terminal section.

-Consensus pattern: [GN]-[DNQPSA]-x-C-[GSTANK]-[GSTADNQ]-[STNQI]-[PTIV]-x-C-C-
                    [DENQKPST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: November 1997 / Pattern and text revised.
