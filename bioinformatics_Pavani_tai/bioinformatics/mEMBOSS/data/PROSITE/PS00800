* Pectinesterase signatures *
*****************************

Pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) (pectin methylesterase)  catalyzes the hydrolysis
of pectin into pectate and methanol.  In plants, it plays an important role in
cell wall  metabolism  during  fruit  ripening, cell wall extension and during
pollen germination.  In  plant  bacterial pathogens such as Erwinia carotovora
and in  fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus niger, pectinesterase is involved
in maceration and soft-rotting of plant tissue.

Prokaryotic and  eukaryotic  pectinesterases  share  a few regions of sequence
similarity [1,2,3].  We  selected  two of these regions as signature patterns.
The first is based on a region in the N-terminal section of these enzymes;  it
contains a conserved tyrosine which may play a role in the catalytic mechanism
[3]. The second pattern corresponds to the conserved sequence around an active
site aspartate  [4],  an  octapeptide  located  in  the  central part of these
enzymes.

-Consensus pattern: [IV]-x-G-[STAD]-[LIVT]-D-[FYI]-[IV]-[FSN]-G
                    [D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 1.
