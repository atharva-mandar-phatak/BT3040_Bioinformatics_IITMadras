* Membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain signature and profile *
*************************************************************************

The membrane  attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain is conserved in bacteria,
fungi, mammals  and  plants.  It  was originally identified and named as being
common to  five  complement components (C6, C7, C8-alpha, C8-beta, and C9) and
perforin. These  molecules  perform  critical functions in innate and adaptive
immunity. The  MAC  family  proteins  and perforin are known to participate in
lytic pore  formation.  In  response  to  pathogen infection, a sequential and
highly specific  interaction  between  the constituent elements occurs to form
transmembrane channels  which  are known as the membrane-attack complex (MAC).
Only a  few  other  MACPF  proteins  have  been  characterized and several are
thought to  form  pores  for  invasion  or  protection  [1,2,3].  Examples are
proteins from  malarial  parasites [4], the cytolytic toxins from sea anemones
[5], and   proteins   that   provide   plant   immunity   [1,6].  Functionally
uncharacterized MACPF proteins are also evident in pathogenic bacteria such as
Chlamydia spp.  [7]  and  Photorhabdus  luminescens  [2].  The MACPF domain is
commonly found  to be associated with other N- and C-terminal domains, such as
TSP1 (see  <PDOC50092>),  LDLRA (see <PDOC00929>), EGF-like (see <PDOC00021>),
Sushi/CCP/SCR (see  <PDOC50923>), FIMAC or C2 (see <PDOC00380>). They probably
control or  target  MACPF  function  [2,8].  The  MACPF  domain  oligomerizes,
undergoes conformational change, and is required for lytic activity.

The MACPF  domain consists of a central kinked four-stranded antiparallel beta
sheet surrounded  by  alpha  helices  and beta strands, forming two structural
segments. Overall,  the  MACPF  domain  has  a  thin  L-shaped appearance (see
<PDB:2QQH; A>).  MACPF domains exhibit limited sequence similarity but contain
a signature [YW]-G-[TS]-H-[FY]-x(6)-G-G motif [2,3,8].

Some proteins known to contain a MACPF domain are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  complement  proteins  C6  to  C9.  Complement  factors C6 to C9
   assemble to  form  a  scaffold,  the  membrane  attack  complex (MAC), that
   permits C9  polymerization  into  pores  that  lyse Gram-negative pathogens
   [3,8].
 - Vertebrate  perforin. It is delivered by natural killer cells and cytotoxic
   T lymphocytes  and forms oligomeric pores (12 to 18 monomers) in the plasma
   membrane of either virus-infected or transformed cells.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana constitutively activated cell death 1 (CAD1) protein.
   It is  likely  to  act  as  a  mediator  that  recognizes plant signals for
   pathogen infection [6].
 - Arabidopsis thaliana necrotic spotted lesions 1 (NSL1) protein [1].
 - Venomous sea anemone Phyllodiscus semoni toxins PsTX-60A and PsTX-60B [5].
 - Venomous sea anemone Actineria villosa toxin AvTX-60A [5].
 - Plasmodium  sporozoite  microneme  protein  essential  for cell traversal 2
   (SPECT2). It  is  essential  for  the  membrane-wounding  activity  of  the
   sporozoite and  is  involved  in its traversal of the sinusoidal cell layer
   prior to hepatocyte-infection [4].
 - Photorhabdus luminescens Plu-MACPF. Although nonlytic, it was shown to bind
   to cell membranes [2].
 - Chlamydial putative uncharacterized protein CT153 [7].

We developed  both  a  pattern and a profile for the MACPF domain. Whereas the
profile covers  the entire MACPF domain, the pattern is based on the conserved
signature of the MACPF domain.

-Consensus pattern: Y-x(6)-[FY]-G-T-H-[FY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for rabbit C8-beta.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: November 2008 / Text revised; profile added.
