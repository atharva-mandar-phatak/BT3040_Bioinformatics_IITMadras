************************************
* GPR1/FUN34/yaaH family signature *
************************************

The following uncharacterized proteins are evolutionary related:

 - Yarrowia lipolytica glyxoxylate pathway regulator GPR1.
 - Yeast protein FUN34.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YCR10c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR384c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC5D6.09c.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yaaH.
 - Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum hypothetical protein Mth215.

They are hydrophobic proteins that seem to contain  six transmembrane  regions
and which could therefore be involved in transport. They  have from 188 to 283
amino acids. As a signature pattern, we selected a conserved region located at
the N-terminal part of the first potential transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: N-P-[AV]-P-[LF]-G-L-x-[GSA]-F
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: July 1998 / Pattern and text revised.
