* HCP repeats signature *
*************************

The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HCP) of sarcoplasmic reticulum [1]
may play a role in the  regulation of  calcium sequestration or release in the
SR of skeletal and cardiac muscle. This protein is very acidic (31% of Asp and
Glu) and rich in histidine (13%).  The sequence  of  HCP  contains  10  tandem
repeats of  a 26 to 29 amino acid residues domain.  This domain starts with an
invariant hexapeptide (HRHRGH),  followed by a stretch of acidic residues. The
end of the domain consist of an almost invariant nonapeptide (STESDRHQA).  The
highly acidic  central  cores of each repeat  are  likely  to  constitute  the
calcium-binding sites of HCP.

The pattern we have developed comprises  the beginning  of the domain and part
of the central acidic stretch.

-Consensus pattern: H-R-H-R-G-H-x(2)-[DE](7)
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
