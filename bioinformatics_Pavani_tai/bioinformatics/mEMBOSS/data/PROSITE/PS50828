**********************
* Smr domain profile *
**********************

The Smr domain is an around 90-residue domain found in:

 - The C-terminal region of the mutS2 proteins from bacteria and plants,
 - The small mutS related (smr) proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes.

These proteins  could  be  involved in mismatch repair (MMR) or/and chromosome
crossing-over and  segregation.  It has been proposed that the Smr domain acts
as a nicking endonuclease [1,2].

The profile we developed spans the entire Smr domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: March 2004 / First entry.
