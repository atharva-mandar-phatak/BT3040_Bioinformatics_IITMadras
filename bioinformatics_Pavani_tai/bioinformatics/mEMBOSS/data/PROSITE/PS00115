****************************************************

RNA polymerase II (EC 2.7.7.6) [1,2]  is   one of  the  three   forms  of  RNA
polymerase that  exist  in eukaryotic nuclei.  The  C-terminal region  of  the
largest subunit of this oligomeric  enzyme consists of the tandem repeat of  a
conserved heptapeptide [3].  The number of  repeats  varies  according  to the
species  (for example: 17 in Plasmodium, 26 in yeast, 44 in Drosophila, and 52
in mammals). The region containing  these repeats is essential to the function
of polymerase II. This  repeated heptapeptide  (called CT7n or CTD) is rich in
hydroxyl groups. It probably projects out of the globular catalytic domain and
may interact with the acidic  activator  domains of transcriptional regulatory
proteins. It is also known to bind by intercalation to DNA.  RNA polymerase II
is activated by phosphorylation. The serine and threonine residues in the CT7n
repeats are the target of such phosphorylation.

-Consensus pattern: Y-[ST]-P-[ST]-S-P-[STANK]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: The consensus for the heptapeptide repeat is Y-S-P-T-S-P-S, but we have
 allowed variants in position 2, 4, and, 7 of the pattern so as to detect some
 of the imperfect repeats.
-Note: Protozoan parasites such Trypanosoma and Crithidia  do  not have a CT7n
 domain.
