AROAAPRMEASE
Aromatic amino acids are concentrated in the cytoplasm of E.coli by 4 
distinct transport systems: a general aromatic amino acid permease, and a
specific permease for each of the 3 types (Phe, Tyr and Trp) [1]. All these
permeases are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and, like bacterial
sugar/cation transporters, are thought to contain 12 transmembrane (TM)
regions [1] - hydropathy analysis, however, is inconclusive, suggesting the
possibility of 10 to 12 membrane-spanning domains [2].

AROAAPRMEASE is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
aromatic amino acid permeases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences, the motifs being drawn largely from the putative
transmembrane (TM) domains: motifs 1-3 correspond to TM regions 1-3; motifs 
4-6 to TM domains 5-7; and 8 and 9 to domains 9 and 10 - motif 7 includes 
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern AROMATIC_AA_PERMEASE (PS00594). A 
single iteration on OWL 23.2 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches
were also found, most of which are also bacterial transport proteins.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
