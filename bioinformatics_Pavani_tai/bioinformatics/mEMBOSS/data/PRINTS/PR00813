BCTERIALGSPG
The general (type II) secretion pathway (GSP) within Gram-negative bacteria
is a signal sequence-dependent process repsonsible for protein export [1-3].
The process has two stages: exoproteins are first translocated across the
inner membrane by the general signal-dependent export pathway (GEP), and 
then across the outer membrane by a species-specific accessory mechanism. 

Several proteins are involved in the GSP; one of these is termed general  
secretion pathway protein G (GSPG). This protein shares several sequence
similarities with bacterial fimbrial protein, or pilin, the major structural
protein of pili [4,5]. Pili are polar flexible filamentous adhesions ~2500nm  
in length, and diameter ~5.4nm. Fimbrial and GSPG proteins share the 
following characteristics: a methylated, hydrophobic N-terminal residue; a 
hydrophobic leader peptide of 5-10 residues, terminating with glycine; 
glutamate as the fifth residue of the mature sequence; and a highly
hydrophobic N-terminus.

BCTERIALGSPG is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
general secretion pathway protein G. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions in the N-terminal portion of the alignment - motif 1 includes the
hydrophobic region encoded by PROSITE pattern PROKAR_NTER_METHYL (PS00409).
Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
