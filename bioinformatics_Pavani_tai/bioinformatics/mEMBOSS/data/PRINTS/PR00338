NUSGTNSCPFCT
The nusG protein is a bacterial transcriptional elongation factor involved
in transcription termination and anti-termination [1,2] - it is thus 
essential for bacterial viability [2]. The protein forms part of the
transcription complex, interacting with RNA polymerase and the termination
factor rho [3,4].

NUSGTNSCPFCT is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for nusG 
transcription termination proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions in the central and C-terminal portions of the alignment, motif 3
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern NUSG (PS01014). Two
iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 11 sequences was identified. A single partial match was
also found, NUSG_CGDAB, a nusG protein fragment from the citrus greening
disease-associated bacterium-like organism.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
