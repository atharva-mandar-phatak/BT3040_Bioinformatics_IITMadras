ELONGATNFCT
Elongation factors belong to a family of proteins that promote the GTP-
dependent binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the A site of ribosomes during
protein biosynthesis, and catalyse the translocation of the synthesised
protein chain from the A to the P site. The proteins are all relatively
similar in the vicinity of their C-termini, and are also highly similar
to a range of proteins that includes the nodulation Q protein from
Rhizobium meliloti, bacterial tetracycline resistance proteins [1]
and the omnipotent supressor protein 2 from yeast.

ELONGATNFCT is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
GTP-binding elongation factors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the C-terminal
portion of the alignment, motifs 1, 3 and 5 including the 3 GTP-binding
consensus segments [2]. Three iterations on OWL11.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 68 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found: these include an
elongation factor from Coleochaete orbicularis (EFTU_COLOB), whose sequence
is rather different from the other elongation factors; a subfamily of 
initiation factors, all of which lack motif 2; two elongation factor
fragments; and several other GTP-binding proteins that match only 2 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 233 sequences, and 143
partial matches.
