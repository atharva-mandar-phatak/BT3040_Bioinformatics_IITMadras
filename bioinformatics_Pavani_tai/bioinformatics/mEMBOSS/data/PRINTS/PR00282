CYTOTOXIN
Snake toxins constitute a family of proteins that includes short and long
neurotoxins, cytotoxins and a variety of venom peptides [1-3]. Most 
of the toxins act by binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
in the postsynaptic membrane of skeletal muscles, preventing binding of
acetylcholine and hence blocking muscle excitation. The toxin primary
structure comprises 60-75 amino acid residues and is characterised by
8 conserved cysteines, all of which are involved in disulphide bridge
formation, and a conserved proline believed to be involved in maintaining
the protein fold.

CYTOTOXIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
snake cytotoxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 10 sequences: the motifs span virtually the full alignment length
and include a conserved proline and 7 cysteine residues, 3 of which are
encoded by PROSITE pattern SNAKE_TOXIN (PS00272) (cf. motifs 4 and 5).
Three iterations of OWL23.1 were required to reach convergence, at which 
point a true set comprising 47 sequences was identified. Several partial
matches were also found, including a cytotoxin homologue that matches
3 motifs, and various neurotoxins that match only two.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 66 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
