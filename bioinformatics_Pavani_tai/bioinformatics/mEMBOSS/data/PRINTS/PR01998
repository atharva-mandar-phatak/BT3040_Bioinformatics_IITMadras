MTP2STAPHYLO
Two major structural proteins from the lactococcal temperate bacteriophage
TP901-1 have been sequenced: the Major Head Protein (MHP) and the Major Tail
Protein (MTP) [1]. Homologues of the major tail protein have since been
found in Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus phages. The 
sequences are fairly short, typically ~150-200 amino acid residues in 
length, and are well conserved. This family of proteins (designated here
phage MTP 2) has its own distinct sequence signature that distinguishes it
from the MTP 1 family (see MTP1FAMILY). 

Sequences belonging to the MTP 2 family are longer than those belonging to
the MTP 1 family, and are well conserved across a range of species. Within
this family, the MTPs of the staphylococcal phage are characterised by their
own unique sequence fingerprint.

MTP2STAPHYLO is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
staphylococcal phage major tail protein. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 19 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR57_40f
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. A single partial match was also found, B9CV53_STACP,
a phage major tail protein from Staphylococcus capitis, which fails to make
signficant matches with motifs 4, 6 and 7.
