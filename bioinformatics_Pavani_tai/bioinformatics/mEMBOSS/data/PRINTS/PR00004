ANAPHYLATOXN
Complement components C3, C4 and C5 are large glycoproteins that have
important functions in the immune response and host defence [1]. They have 
a wide variety of biological activities and are proteolytically activated 
by cleavage at a specific site, forming a- and b-fragments [2]. A-fragments 
form distinct structural domains of approximately 76 amino acids, coded for
by a single exon within the complement protein gene. The C3a, C4a and C5a 
components are referred to as anaphylatoxins [2,3]: they cause smooth muscle
contraction, histamine release from mast cells, and enhanced vascular 
permeability [3]; they also mediate chemotaxis, inflammation, and generation
of cytotoxic oxygen radicals [3]. The proteins are highly hydrophilic, with 
a mainly alpha-helical structure held together by 3 disulphide bridges [3].

ANAPHYLATOXN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
complement C3a, C4a and C5a anaphylatoxin domains. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs encode 
conserved regions containing 6 cysteines involved in disulphide bond
formation. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 28 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences.
