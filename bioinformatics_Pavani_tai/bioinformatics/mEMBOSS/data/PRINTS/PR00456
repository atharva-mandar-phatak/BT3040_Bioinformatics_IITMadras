RIBOSOMALP2
Eukaryotic ribosomal P proteins have been classified according to their
similarity to the mammalian P0, P1 and P2 proteins [1], all of which
share a similar primary structure: an apparently globular N-terminal
domain (which includes the protein core); an Ala-rich hinge region; and
a highly-acidic Glu/Asp-rich C-terminal domain - this contains the
ribosomal P consensus sequence EESDDDMGFGLFD, which protrudes from the
ribosomal stalk. 

The C-terminal regions of Trypanosoma cruzi P proteins are strongly
immunogenic in Chagas disease. All 3 forms of the protein show the ability 
to generate autoimmune responses, but their antigenic properties differ as
a result of discrepancies in their C-terminal sequences [1]. The main linear
epitope of the T.cruzi P1 and P2 proteins has been mapped to the 13-residue
C-terminal sequence (R-13) EEEDDDMGFGLFD. This is identical to the
eukaryotic P consensus, but has Ser substituted by Glu, yielding a more
hydrophilic sequence, which is critical in determining the immunological
reactivity of the T.cruzi R-13 epitope in Chagas disease.   

RIBOSOMALP2 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for a 
family of T.cruzi P2 ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1-4 span
the N-terminal globular domain; motif 5 lies in the Ala-rich hinge region;
and motif 6 encodes the ribosomal P consensus sequence. A single iteration
on OWL27.1 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches were also found,
all of which are either P2 proteins from different organisms or closely-
related ribosomal P1 proteins.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences, and 12
partial matches.
