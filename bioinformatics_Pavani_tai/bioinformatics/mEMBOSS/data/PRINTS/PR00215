NEUROMODULIN
Neuromodulin is a major growth cone membrane protein whose expression is
widely correlated with successful axon elongation [1]: it is a crucial
component of an effective regeneration response in the nervous system [2].
Although its function is uncertain, the N-terminal region is well
conserved, containing both a calmodulin binding domain, and sites for
acylation, membrane attachment and protein kinase C phosphorylation [1].
The C-terminal sequences, however, are not conserved, although their amino
acid compositions are similar [1]. Structure predictions suggest the C-
terminus may exist as an extended, negatively-charged rod with some
similarity to the side arms of neurofilaments, intimating that the
biological role of neuromodulin may depend on the ability to form a
dynamic membrane-cytoplasm-calmodulin complex [1].

NEUROMODULIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
neuromodulins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the N-terminal region, motif 1
encoding 2 palmitoylated Cys residues responsible for the attachment of the
protein to the membrane (cf. PROSITE pattern NEUROMODULIN_1 (PS00412)), and
motif 2 encoding a phosphorylated Ser residue that lies adjacent to the
calmodulin-binding domain (cf. PROSITE pattern NEUROMODULIN_2 (PS00413)).
Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences.
