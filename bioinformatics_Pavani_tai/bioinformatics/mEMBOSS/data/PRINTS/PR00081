GDHRDH
Glucose dehydrogenase catalyses the oxidation of D-glucose without prior
phosphorylation to D-beta-gluconolactone using NAD or NADP as a coenzyme.
The enzyme is a tetrameric protein, each of the 4 identical subunits
containing 262 amino acid residues.

GDHRDH is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for a family 
of closely related dehydrogenases, dehydroxylases and reductases. The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 11 glucose and 
ribitol dehydrogenases: motif 2 spans a highly conserved NNAGI sequence;
motif 4 includes the conserved YSASK sequence encoded by PROSITE pattern
ADH_SHORT (PS00061), which contains conserved Tyr and Lys residues, of
which the former is important for subunit binding in glucose dehyrogenase
[1]. Four iterations on OWL11.0 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 23 sequences was identified. In addition,
subfamilies emerged that lacked the full complement of motifs, most
notable amongst which is the group of insect alcohol dehydrogenases 
matching motifs 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 197 sequences, and 398
partial matches.
