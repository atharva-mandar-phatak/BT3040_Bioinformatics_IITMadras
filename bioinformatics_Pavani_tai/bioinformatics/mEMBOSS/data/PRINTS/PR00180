CRETINALDHBP
Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) carries 11-cis-retinol and
11-cis-retinaldehyde as endogenous ligands: it is found only in visual 
tissue, where it serves as a stereo-selective agent and/or a substrate
carrier protein [1]. CRALBP can protect its substrate from photo-isomeris-
ation, suggesting a possible role in the generation of 11-cis-retinols in
the visual cycle [2]. Sequence studies have revealed no similarities either
to other lipophile-binding proteins (such as fatty-acid binding proteins)
or to other retinoid-binding proteins (such as rhodopsin or cone visual
pigments) [1]. The location of the binding site and exact function of
CRALBP are still unclear [1,2].

Alpha-tocopherol transport protein is known to share sequence similarity
with CRALBP [3]. This protein binds only alpha-tocopherol (and not the
gamma form), and as such displays the same sort of stereo-selective
binding as implicated with CRALBP [3]. 

CRETINALDHBP is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
cellular retinaldehyde binding and alpha-tocopherol transport proteins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences:
the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length. A single iteration on OWL25.1 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
