LYSASSOCTDMP
Lysozyme-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMP) are integral membrane
proteins of, as yet, unknown function [1]. Their primary structures
contain an internal repeat, each containing 4 conserved cysteine residues,
which are presumably involved in disulphide bridge formation. The two 
similar domains are separated by a proline-rich hinge region, and at the
C-terminus is a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic tail.

Macrosialin (macrophage protein CD68) [2] is an integral membrane protein
that shows some similarity to LAMP sequences. The primary structure
contains a mucin-like region, followed by a proline-rich hinge, a single
LAMP-like domain, a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. 

LYSASSOCTDMP is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for LAMP
and LAMP-like membrane glycoproteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions in the second domain, and include 3 of the conserved cysteines -
motifs 1 and 3-5 encompass the regions encoded by PROSITE patterns LAMP_1
(PS00310) and LAMP_2 (PS00311). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 16 sequences
was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences.
