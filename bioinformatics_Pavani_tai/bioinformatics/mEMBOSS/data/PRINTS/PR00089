LUCIFERASE
The enzyme responsible for bioluminescence in motile Gram-negative luminous
bacteria is bacterial luciferase [1,2], which catalyses the oxidation of
reduced riboflavin phosphate and a long-chain fatty aldehyde, with the
emission of blue-green light (490nm). Luciferase is a heterodimeric enzyme
comprising alpha and beta subunits (genes luxA and luxB), which appear to 
have arisen through gene duplication.

Some species of Photobacterium contain a bioluminescence operon that 
encodes a non-fluorescent flavoprotein (NFP) (gene luxF). The function of 
NFP is not known, but it is clearly related to the luxA and luxB subunits.

LUCIFERASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial luciferases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: motifs 2 and 3 span the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern BACTERIAL_LUCIFERASE (PS00494). Four iterations on OWL17.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, the non-
fluorescent flavoprotein LUXF_PHOLE, which fails to make significant
matches with motifs 1 and 3. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences.
