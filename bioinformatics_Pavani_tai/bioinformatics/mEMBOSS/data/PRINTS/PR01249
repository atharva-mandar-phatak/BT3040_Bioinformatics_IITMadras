RIBOSOMALL31
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2].

Ribosomal protein L31 is one of the proteins from the large ribosomal
subunit. The protein contains 66-97 amino acid residues with a calculated
molecular weight of 6967. The sequence contains four cysteine residues,
which are believed to form two disulphide bridges [2]. To date, the
protein has only been found in eubacteria and in some algal chloroplasts. 

RIBOSOMALL31 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
ribosomal protein L31. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length - motifs 2 and 3 span the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern RIBOSOMAL_L31 (PS01143). Three iterations on SPTR37_10f 
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 20 
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, both of which
are RL31 proteins that fail to make a significant match with motif 1.
