PROHIBITIN
Genes that negatively regulate proliferation inside the cell are of
considerable interest because of the implications in processes such as
development and cancer [1]. Prohibitin, a novel cytoplasmic anti-
proliferative protein widely expressed in a variety of tissues, inhibits
DNA synthesis. Studies have suggested that prohibitin may be a suppressor
gene and is associated with tumor development and/or progression of at
least some breast cancers [2]. Sequence comparisons suggest that the
prohibitin gene is an analogue of Cc, a Drosophila gene that is vital for
normal development [1].

PROHIBITIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
prohibitins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the central portion of the
alignment - motif 2 contains Val and Arg residues known to be mutated in
sporadic breast cancer. A single iteration on OWL29.1 was required to reach 
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
Two partial matches were found: L2CC_DROME is the Drosophila Cc analogue,
which matches motifs 1-3 and 6 and 7; and D9090073 is a C-terminal fragment
that matches motifs 6 and 7.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
