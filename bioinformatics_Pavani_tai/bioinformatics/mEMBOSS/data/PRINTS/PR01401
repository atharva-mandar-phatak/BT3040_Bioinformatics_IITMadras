MUTATORMUTT
MutT is a small bacterial protein (~12-15kDa) involved in the GO system [1]
responsible for removing an oxidatively damaged form of guanine (8-hydroxy-
guanine or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) from the nucleotide pool. 8-oxo-dGTP
is inserted opposite dA and dC residues of template DNA with near equal
efficiency, leading to A.T to G.C transversions. MutT degrades 8-oxo-dGTP
to the monophosphate, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate. A short
conserved N-terminal region of mutT (designated the MutT domain) is also
found in a variety of other prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic proteins
[2-5]. Recently, the generic name 'NUDIX hydrolases' (NUcleoside DIphosphate
linked to some other moeity X) has been coined for this domain family [6].

The solution structure of the MutT enzyme has been solved by NMR {7]. The
structure is globular and compact, and contains a five-stranded mixed
beta-sheet. The parallel portion of the sheet is sandwiched between two
alpha-helices, forming an alpha+beta fold [7]. 

MUTATORMUTT is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for mutator
MutT proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the N- and
C-terminal portions of the alignment - motif 1 spans beta-strands 1-4; and
motif 2 spans strands 7 and 8. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
