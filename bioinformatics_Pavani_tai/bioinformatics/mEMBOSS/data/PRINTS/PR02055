PROTEINF105
An approximately 350-residue amino acid polypeptide, designated protein
FAM105A, has been identified in a range of vertebrates. It shares a high
degree of similarity with protein FAM105B. The function of proteins
within this family is currently unknown.

PROTEINF105 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
protein family FAM105. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.
