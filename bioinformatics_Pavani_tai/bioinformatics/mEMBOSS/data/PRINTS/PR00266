INTERFERONAB
Interferons produce antiviral and antiproliferative responses in cells, and
are defined by their ability to confer viral resistance to their target
cell [1]. Type I interferons can be divided into alpha, beta and omega
(alpha-II) subtypes, depending on their sequence: these sequence
differences may possibly cause different responses to various inducers, or 
result in the recognition of different target cell types [2]. The main
conserved structural feature of interferons is a disulphide bond that, 
except in mouse beta interferon, occurs in all alpha, beta and omega
sequences.

INTERFERONAB is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for alpha,
beta and omega interferons. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 14 sequences: motifs 1 and 3 each contain one of the Cys
residues involved in disulphide bond formation, motif 3 including the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern INTERFERON_ALPHABETA (PS00252). Two
iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 93 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 92 sequences.
