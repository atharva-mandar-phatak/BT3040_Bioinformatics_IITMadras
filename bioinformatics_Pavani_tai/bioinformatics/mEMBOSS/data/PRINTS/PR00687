TRPRNAAP
The mtr operon encodes a presumed RNA-binding regulatory protein that is
required for attenuation control of the trp operon [1]. The operon consists
of two structural genes, mtrA and mtrB, predicted to encode 22kDa and 6kDa
polypeptides respectively [1,2]. MtrB is similar to RegA, an RNA-binding
regulatory protein of bacteriophage T4. Both mtrA and mtrB have been shown
to be necessary for regulation of beta-galactosidase production. 

The crystal structure of the Trp RNA-binding attenuation protein of 
B.subtilis has been solved [3,4]. The protein is an ondecamer of 7-stranded 
beta-sandwiches. The 11 subunits are stabilised by 11 inter-subunit strands,
forming a beta-wheel with a large central hole. The binding of L-tryptophan
in clefts between adjacent strands induces conformational changes in the
protein [4]. It is possible that, on binding, the mRNA target forms a
matching circle in which 11 U/GAG repeats are bound to the surface of the
protein ondecamer modified by the binding of L-tryptophan [4]. 

TRPRNAAP is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
transcription attenuation protein mtrB. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs span the full alignment
length - motif 1 spans strands 1 and 2; motif 2 includes strand 3; motif 3
spans strands 4 and 5; and motif 4 spans strands 6 and 7. A single iteration 
on OWL29.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
