HIPIPFRDOXIN
High potential iron-sulphur proteins (HiPIP) present a unique family of 
4Fe-4S ferredoxins that function in anaerobic electron transport chains;
some have a redox potential higher than any other known iron-sulphur protein
(e.g., HiPIP from Rhodopila globiformis has a redox potential of ca. 450 mV
[1]). Several HiPIPs have so far been characterised structurally [2-5],
their folds belonging to the mainly-beta class. As in other bacterial
ferredoxins, the [4Fe-4S] cluster adopts a cubane-like conformation and is
ligated to the protein via 4 cysteinyl sulphur ligands [2], which are
located in type I turns [3].

HIPIP is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for high
potential iron-sulphur proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 14 sequences: motif 1 includes the first and second
invariant Cys residues; motif 2 contains the fourth invariant Cys, and
partly spans the region encoded by PROSITE pattern HIPIP (PS00596). Two 
iterations on OWL25.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point 
a true set comprising 21 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences.
