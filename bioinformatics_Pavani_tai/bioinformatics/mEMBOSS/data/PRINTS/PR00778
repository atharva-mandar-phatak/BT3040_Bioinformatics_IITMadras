HTHARSR
Bacterial transcription regulatory proteins that bind DNA via a helix-turn-
helix (HTH) motif can be grouped into families on the basis of sequence 
similarities. One such group, termed arsR, includes several proteins that
appear to dissociate from DNA in the presence of metal ions: arsR, which
functions as a transcriptional repressor of an arsenic resistance operon;
smtB from Synechococcus, which acts as a transcriptional repressor of the
smtA gene that codes for a metallothionein; cadC, a protein required for
cadmium-resistance; and hypothetical protein yqcJ from Bacillus subtilis.

The HTH motif is thought to be located in the central part of these
proteins [1]. The motif is characterised by a number of well-conserved
residues: at its N-terminal extremity is a cysteine residue; a second Cys
is found in arsR and cadC, but not in smtA; and at the C-terminus lie one
or two histidines. These residues may be involved in metal-binding (Zn in
smtB; metal-oxyanions such as arsenite, antimonite and arsenate for arsR;
and cadmium for cadC) [2]. It is believed that binding of a metal ion could
induce a conformational change that would prevent the protein from binding
DNA [2]. 

HTHARSR is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial regulatory protein arsR family. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 2 and 3
span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern HTH_ARSR_FAMILY (PS00846), which
includes the complete HTH motif. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 21 sequences
was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which
appear to be related DNA-binding proteins that contain an HTH motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 30 sequences, and 27
partial matches.
