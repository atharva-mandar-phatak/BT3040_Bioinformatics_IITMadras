INTRLEUKIN24
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-24 (IL-24, also known as melanoma differentiation-associated 
gene-7) belongs to the family of IL-10-related cytokines, which includes 
IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [1]. It has been proposed, based on the
expression pattern of IL-24 and its receptors, that the cytokine may play
a role in epidermal functions, such as wound healing [2]. IL-24 has also
been shown to possess cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing activity, and has
therefore been suggested as a potential anti-cancer agent [3].

INTRLEUKIN24 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-24. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR55_38f was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. A single partial match was also found, Q2YHE5_HUMAN, a human 
interleukin-24 splice variant that fails to match motif 2.
