VCAM1
Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is part of the immunoglobulin
superfamily. They are important in inflammation, immune responses and in
intracellular signalling events [1]. 

VCAM-1 was first described as a cytokine-inducible endothelial adhesion
molecule. It can bind to leucocyte integrin VL-4 (very late antigen-4) to 
recruit leucocytes to sites of inflammation [2]. The predominant form of
VCAM-1 in vivo has an N-terminal extracellular region comprising seven
Ig-like domains [3]. A conserved integrin-binding motif has been identified 
in domains 1 and 4, variants of which are present in the N-terminal domain
of all members of the integrin-binding subgroup of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily [3]. The structure of a VLA-4-binding fragment comprising the
first two domains of VCAM-1 has been determined to 1.8A resolution [3]. The
integrin-binding motif is exposed and forms the N-terminal region of the
loop between beta-strands C and D of domain 1 [3]. VCAM-1 domains 1 and 2
are structurally similar to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 [2]. 

VCAM1 is 6-element fingerprint that a provides a signature for the VCAM-1
cell adhesion molecules. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignement of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
towards the N-terminal portion of the alignment - motifs 1 and 2 lie within
the N-terminus of domain 1; and the remaining motifs lie in the N-terminal
region of domain 3. Two iterations on SPTR39_14f were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified.
