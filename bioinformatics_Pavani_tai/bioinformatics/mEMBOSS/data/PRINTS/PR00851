XRODRMPGMNTB
Defects in DNA repair proteins can give rise, in humans, to the autosomal
recessive disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne's syndrome [1,2].
XP is characterised by a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer,
the effect of skin-cell hypersensitivity to UV resulting from defects in
the nucleotide excision pathway. Seven XP complementation groups have
been identified: XP-A to XP-G.  

The human DNA excision repair gene ERCC3 specifically corrects the
nucleotide excision repair (NER) defect of XP complementation group B [3,4].
In addition to its role in NER, the ERCC3 DNA helicase has also been 
identified as one of the components of the human BTF2/TFIIH transcription 
factor complex, which is required for initiation of transcription of class
II genes [3,4]. XP group B (XP-B) give rise to both XP and Cockayne syndrome
[3]. The involvement of the ERCC3 protein in the vital process of 
transcription may provide an explanation for the rarity, severity and 
wide spectrum of clinical features in this complementation group [3].

XRODRMPGMNTB is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
xeroderma pigmentosum group B complementation proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 
4 encodes the putative ATP-binding domain; and motif 5 includes a DEVH box.
Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required to reach convergence, at which 
point a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified. Two partial 
matches were also found: SSZ84168 is a pig DNA-repair protein EST; and 
F69294, a DNA repair protein RAD25 homologue.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
