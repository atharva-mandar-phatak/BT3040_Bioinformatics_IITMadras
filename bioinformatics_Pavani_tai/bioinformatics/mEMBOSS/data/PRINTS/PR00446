HYDRGNUPTAKE
The hydrogenase-specific gene (hup and hyp) products of R.capsulatus show
[1] a high degree of similarity to hydrogenase gene products from E.coli 
(hyaD) [2], R.leguminosarum (hupD) [3], A.vinlandii (hoxM) [4] and
A.eutrophus (hoxM) [5], which together are designated the hupD/hyaD family.
The hup and hox gene products are absolutely required for hydrogenase
activity, hoxM mediating the attachment of hydrogenase to the bacterial
membrane, which is essential for enzymatic activity. The function of hyaD
is unknown, but with hyaE could form a complex involved in processing of
the hydrogenase 1 structural operon. 

HYDRGNUPTAKE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hupD/hyaD family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.3 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, both of which are
hypothetical proteins: S24796 fails to make a significant match with 
motif 3, and PQ0128 is a fragment lacking the portion of sequence bearing
the final 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
