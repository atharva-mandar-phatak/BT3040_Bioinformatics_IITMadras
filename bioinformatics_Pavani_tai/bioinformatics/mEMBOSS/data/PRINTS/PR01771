ERK3ERK4MAPK
MAP (Mitogen Activated Protein) kinases participate in kinase cascades,  
whereby at least 3 protein kinases act in series, culminating in activation 
of MAP kinase [1-2]. MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation 
on both tyrosine and threonine residues of a conserved TXY motif.

ERKs (Extracellularly Regulated Kinases) belong to the family of MAP 
kinases. ERK3 was first identified in a cDNA library using a probe for 
ERK1 [6]. ERK 3 and 4, however, have no more similarity to ERK 1 and 2 than 
do the other major classes of MAP kinase, JNK and p38. ERK3 is 
constitutively located in the nucleus, despite the lack of a traditional 
nuclear localisation signal [3]. It is unique among MAP kinases in 
containing in its activation loop only a single phosphorylation site (serine 
189) - other MAP kinases have the sequence TXY in this loop, but ERK3 
contains SEG, with glycine in place of tyrosine.  

ERK3 has no homologues in nematode or yeast genomes, indicating that it may 
have arisen from a relatively late gene duplication [4-5]. Its structure, 
based on similarity to ERK2, contains segregated alpha and beta regions.

ERK3ERK4MAPK is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
ERK3/4 MAP kinases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually 
the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise the 
ERK 3 and ERK 4 enzymes but distinguish them from the rest of the 
MAP kinase family - motif 1 includes the ATP binding site. A single 
iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
