POSTSYNAPTIC
The 43kDa postsynaptic protein is a peripheral membrane protein thought
to be involved in the anchoring or stabilisation of the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor at synaptic sites [1,2]: it is possible that it
links the receptor to the postsynaptic cytoskeleton through direct
association with actin or spectrin. The protein is highly-conserved
across species, regions in the N- and C-termini possibly being important
for interaction with components of the postsynaptic membrane. 

POSTSYNAPTIC is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
43kDa postsynaptic proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 were drawn from conserved
N-terminal regions, and motifs 3 and 4 from the C-terminus - motif 1
includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern 43_KD_POSTSYNAPTIC
(PS00405). A single iteration on OWL24.0 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
