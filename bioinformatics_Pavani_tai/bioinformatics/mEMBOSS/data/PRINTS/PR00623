HISTONEH4
Histone H4 is a small, highly conserved nuclear protein that, together
with 2 molecules each of histones H2A, H2B and H3, forms the eukaryotic
nucleosome core; the nucleosome octamer winds ~146 DNA base-pairs.

HISTONEH4 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H4 histones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length - motif 1 includes the first 2 residues of the
pentapeptide encoded by PROSITE pattern HISTONE_H4 (PS00047), the lysine
residue of which is often acetylated [2] and the histidine of which is
implicated in DNA binding [3]. Two iterations on OWL29.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 29 sequences
was identified. Several partial matches were also found, most of which
are fragments: the exception is H4_ENTHI, an H4 histone that matches motif
1 only poorly and lacks the characteristic DNA-binding pentapeptide.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 34 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
