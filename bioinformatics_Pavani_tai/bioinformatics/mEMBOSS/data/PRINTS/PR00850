GLHYDRLASE59
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 59 contains galactocerebrosidases (EC 3.2.1.46). 

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is a severe, autosomal
recessive disorder that results from deficiency of galactocerebrosidase
(GALC) activity [5-7]. GALC is responsible for the lysosomal catabolism of
certain galactolipids, including galactosylceramide and psychosine [5]. 

GLHYDRLASE59 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 59 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 6 and 9 include
potential glycosylation sites. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, HUMGALACB, a
human mRNA galactocerebrosidase splice product that lacks the portion of
sequence bearing the last 4 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
