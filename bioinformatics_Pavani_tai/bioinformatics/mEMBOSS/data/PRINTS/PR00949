TYPE3IMAPROT
Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves 
transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell 
exterior [1]. There have been four secretion systems described in 
animal enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further 
sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [1]. 

The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to 
transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell 
[2] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with
the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of 
bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [3]. However, while the latter forms a
ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of
the flagellum itself [3], type III subunits in the outer membrane
translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.

It is believed that the family of type III inner membrane proteins are 
used as structural moieties in a complex with several other subunits [4]. 
One such set of inner membrane proteins, labeled "A" here for nomenclature 
purposes, includes the Salmonella InvA and Shigella MxiA, the Yersinia LcrD, 
Rhizobium Y4YR, and the Erwinia HrcI genes [4]. The flagellar protein FlhA 
also shares similarity, probably due to evolution of the Type III secretion 
system from the flagellar biosynthetic pathway. 

TYPE3IMAPROT is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
type III secretion system inner membrane A protein family. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~600 amino acids).
Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which 
point a true set comprising 35 sequences was identified. Two partial matches
were also found, both flagellar biosynthetic genes that failed to match one
or more N-terminal motifs.
