DEXMETHSNEIP
Dexamethasone is a member of the glucocorticoid group of steroid hormones;
it functions as an anti-inflammatory and immunosupressant. A differentially-
expressed transcript of unknown function has been identified in
emphysematous lungs [1] - this has been named Dexamethasone-Induced
transcript (DEXI). It is suggested that the up-regulation of DEXI in
emphysema patient's tissues may be a direct result of their treatment with
corticosteroids [1].

The human DEXI protein is a 95-residue acidic polypeptide, predicted to
contain a central transmembrane domain and a C-terminal leucine zipper [1].
It is unclear how dexamethasone influences proteins within this family.
However, the leucine zipper contains a predicted casein kinase II 
phosphorylation site, suggesting that interaction may possibly be regulated
by phosphorylation [1]. It is hoped that further studies will eventually
help to elucidate the function of this protein and its role in emphysema
and inflammatory-airway disease [1].

DEXMETHSNEIP is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for  
dexamethasone-induced proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.
