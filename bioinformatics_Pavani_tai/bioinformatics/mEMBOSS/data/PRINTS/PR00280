CHANLCOLICIN
Colicins are unusual bacterial toxins. They are directed against close
relatives of the producing strain, killing their targets in one of
three distinct ways: via a ribonuclease; via a deoxyribonuclease activity;
or by forming pores in the target cell membrane [1]. Channel-forming 
colicins are transmembrane proteins that depolarise the cytoplasmic
membrane, leading to dissipation of cellular energy [2,3]. Their N-terminal
regions are involved in their uptake, the central portion is important for
binding to outer membrane receptors, and the C-terminus forms the channel.

CHANLCOLICIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
channel-forming colicins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions towards the C-terminus, motif 4 including the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern CHANNEL_COLCIN (PS00276). Two iterations on OWL24.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
10 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, which
fails to make a significant match with motif 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 23 sequences, and 1
partial match.
