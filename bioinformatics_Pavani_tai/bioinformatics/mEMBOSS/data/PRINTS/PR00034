HTHCRP
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family groups together a range of proteins, including
anr, crp, clp, cysR, fixK, flp, fnr, fnrN, hlyX and ntcA [1-3]. Within this
family, the HTH motif is situated towards the C-terminus.

HTHCRP is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of the crp bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs completely encompass
the HTH motif, extending a few residues beyond its N- and C-termini (cf.
PROSITE pattern HTH_CRP_FAMILY (PS00042)). Four iterations on OWL21.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 27
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 48 sequences.
