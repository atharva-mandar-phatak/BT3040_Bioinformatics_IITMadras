LEUSERPINII
Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a glycoprotein in human plasma that inhibits
thrombin rapidly in the presence of dermatan sulphate or heparin [1]. In
the presence of these glycosaminoglycans, HCII becomes the predominant
thrombin inhibitor in place of antithrombin III (AT). It also inhibits
chymotrypsin, but in a glycosaminoglycan-independent manner. Not only does
HCII function as a thrombin inhibitor, but limited proteolysis near its N- 
terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) that might participate in
inflammation and in wound healing and tissue repair processes [2]. 

The sequence of HCII contains a signal peptide of 19 amino acids and a
mature protein of 480 amino acids [3]. The N-terminal portion of HCII 
contains two acidic repeats (EDDDYLD and EDDDYID) that may bind to anion-
binding exosite I of thrombin to facilitate covalent complex formation [4].
The sequence of HCII shares similarity with anti-thrombin III and other
members of the alpha 1-antitrypsin superfamily [3]. 

LEUSERPINII is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
heparin cofactor II. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
the N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1 spans the acidic repeats; 
and motif 3 contains the glycosaminoglycan binding site. A single iteration
on OWL29.4 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. Three partial matches were found, all
of which are related members of the serpin family.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
