GABABRECEPTR
GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the brain, and signals through ionotropic (GABA(A)/GABA(C)) and
metabotropic (GABA(B)) receptor systems [1]. The GABA(B) receptors have 
been cloned, and photoaffinity labelling experiments suggest that they
correspond to two highly conserved receptor forms in the vertebrate nervous
system [1]. 

GABA(B) receptors are involved in the fine tuning of inhibitory synaptic
transmission [2]. Presynaptic receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release by
down-regulating high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, while postsynaptic 
receptors decrease neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly
rectifying K+ (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory post-
synaptic potentials [2]. GABA(B) receptors negatively couple to adenylyl
cyclase and show sequence similarity to the metabotropic receptors for the
excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate. 

GABABRECEPTR is a 14-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
GABA(B) receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was 
identified. Several partial matches were also found: Q23442 is a C.elegans
protein that matches motifs 8-11; the rest are metabotropic glutamate and
pheromone receptors that match two motifs.
