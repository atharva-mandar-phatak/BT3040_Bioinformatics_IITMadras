WWDOMAIN
The WW domain, a short conserved region found in a number of disparate
proteins, is characterised by 2 conserved Trp residues and a conserved Pro
(hence its alternative name, WWP) [1]. Among the proteins known to contain
WW domains is dystrophin, the product encoded by the gene responsible for
Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The domain contains around 35-40 residues,
and may be repeated up to 4 times in some sequences. It appears to bind
proteins that contain characteristic proline motifs ([AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y),
and resembles, to an extent, the SH3 domains. It is often associated with
other domains that typify proteins involved in signal transduction.

WWDOMAIN is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the WW
domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 11
sequences: the motifs span the full domain length, and correspond to the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern WW_DOMAIN (PS01159), which includes the
2 conserved Trp residues and the conserved Pro. Two iterations on OWL26.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
19 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 43 sequences.
