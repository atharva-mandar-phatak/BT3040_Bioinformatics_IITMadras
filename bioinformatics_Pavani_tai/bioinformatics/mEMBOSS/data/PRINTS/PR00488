5LPOXGNASEAP
Five-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) is an integral membrane protein
found in cells that produce leukotrienes [1-4] - leukotrienes are the
biologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid, and have been
implicated in a variety of inflammatory responses, including asthma,
arthritis and psoriasis [3].

FLAP appears to activatate 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) by facilitating its
binding to membranes [4] - it binds arachidonic acid, and may play a role
in its transfer to 5LOX. The protein has been shown to bind to MK-886, a
compound that blocks leukotriene biosynthesis [3].

5LPOXGNASEAP is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
5-lipoxygenase activating proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
9 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, HSU09353
and MMU27195, both of which are leukotriene C4 synthases, which fail to
make significant matches with 2, 6 and 7.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
