PLPEROXIDASE
Peroxidases are haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions.
Most haem peroxidases follow the reaction scheme:

Fe(3+) + H2O2            --> [Fe(4+)=O]R' (Compound I) + H2O
[Fe(4+)=O]R' + substrate --> [Fe(4+)=O]R (Compound II) + oxidised substrate
[Fe(4+)=O]R  + substrate -->  Fe(3+) + H2O + oxidised substrate

In this mechanism, the enzyme reacts with one equivalent of H2O2 to give 
[Fe(4+)=O]R' (compound I). This is a two-electron oxidation/reduction 
reaction where H2O2 is reduced to water and the enzyme is oxidised. One 
oxidising equivalent resides on iron, giving the oxyferryl [Fe(4+)=O] 
intermediate, while in many peroxidases the porphyrin (R) is oxidised to 
the porphyrin pi-cation radical (R'). Compound I then oxidises an organic 
substrate to give a substrate radical [1].

Peroxidases are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. On the basis
of sequence similarity, fungal, plant and bacterial peroxidases can be
viewed as members of a superfamily consisting of 3 major classes [2]. Class
III comprises the secretory plant peroxidases, which have multiple tissue-
specific functions: e.g., removal of hydrogen peroxide from chloroplasts and
cytosol; oxidation of toxic compounds; biosynthesis of the cell wall;
defence responses towards wounding; indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) catabolism;
ethylene biosynthesis; and so on. The wide spectrum of peroxidase activity,
coupled with the participation in various physiological processes, is in
keeping with its relative lack of specificity for substrates and the
occurence of a variety of isozymes [3]. Plant peroxidases are monomeric
glycoproteins containing 4 conserved disulphide bridges and 2 calcium ions.
The 3D structure of peanut peroxidase has been shown to possess the same
helical fold as class I and II peroxidases [4].  

PLPEROXIDASE is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
plant peroxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment 
of 23 sequences: motif 2 contains invariant active site residues (Arg and
the "distal" His) and a conserved aromatic residue that together form a
ligand pocket for hydrogen peroxide (cf. motif 1 of signature PEROXIDASE
and PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_2 (PS00436)) - it also contains 2 invariant
Cys residues involved in disulphide bond formation; motif 3 spans helix C;
motif 4, which corresponds to motif 2 of signature PEROXIDASE, contains the
N-terminal part of helix D, and includes an invariant Cys (the D helix
N-terminus is tied to the molecular C-terminus by a disulphide bridge [4]);
motifs 5-7 correspond to motifs 3-5 of signature PEROXIDASE - motif 6
contains the invariant "proximal" His, which serves the axial ligand of the
haem iron, and spans the region encoded by PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_1
(PS00435). Two iterations on OWL27.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 61 sequences was identified. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are either plant peroxidases
(matching 3-8 motifs) or ascorbate peroxidases (matching only 2-3 motifs).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 102 sequences, and 39
partial matches.
