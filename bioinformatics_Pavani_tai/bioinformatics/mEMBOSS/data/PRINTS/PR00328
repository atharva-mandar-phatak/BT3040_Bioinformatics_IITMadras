SAR1GTPBP
The SAR1 protein, thought to be present in all eukaryotes, mediates
vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi
apparatus [1]. It is a GTP-binding protein that takes part in the
formation of secretory vesicles by binding to an ER type II membrane
protein, Sec12p [2]. SAR1 is well-conserved and possesses three short
motifs that are involved in the GTP-binding activity - these are similar
to corresponding regions in RAS-related proteins [3], and there are also
similarities to ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs).

SAR1GTPBP is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for GTP-
binding SAR1 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length, motifs 1, 2 and 4 corresponding to
regions implicated in GTP-binding - motif 5 includes the C-terminal region
encoded by PROSITE pattern SAR1 (PS01020). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 5
sequences was identified. Thirty three partial matches were also found:
S37106 is a GTP-binding protein fragment from Arabidopsis thaliana; 29 are
ADP-ribosylation factors; and the last, GBA1_YEAST, is another GTP-binding
protein - most of these are similar to the GTP-binding regions of SAR1 and
to motif 3, but show limited similarity elsewhere. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences, and 29
partial matches.
