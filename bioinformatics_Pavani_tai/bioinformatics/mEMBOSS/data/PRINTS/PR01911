PFDSPHPHTASE
Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1g05000 encodes a protein that contains the 
protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) signature motif and has been annotated 
as a putative dual specificity phosphatase [1]. The three-dimensional 
structure resembles the conserved catalytic PTP domain. Sequence analysis
shows that similar proteins exist in other plants and fungi. The
Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIW14 protein belongs to this group of PTPs, and
has been shown to be involved in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton
in response to nutrient limitation [2].

PFDSPHPHTASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for a
novel subfamily of plant and fungal dual specificity phosphatases. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 16 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the N-terminal portion of
the alignment, avoiding the catalytic PTP domain, which is conserved in the
PTP superfamily. Three iterations on SPTR49_32f were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 29 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, Leishmania and Aspergillus
proteins that seem to be putative orthologues.
