THIONIN
Thionins are small, basic plant proteins, 45 to 50 amino acids in length,
which include 3 or 4 conserved disulphide linkages. Their sequences are all
highly similar and are likely to possess the same 3D structure [1]. The
proteins are toxic to animal cells, presumably attacking the cell membrane
and rendering it permeable: this results in the inhibition of sugar uptake
and allows potassium and phosphate ions, proteins, and nucleotides to leak
from cells [1]. Thionins are mainly found in seeds where they may act as a
defence against consumption by animals. A barley leaf thionin has also been
identified: this is highly toxic to plant pathogens and is involved in the
mechanism of plant defence against microbial infections [2]. The hydro-
phobic protein crambin from the Abyssinian cabbage (Crambe abyssinica) is
also a member of the thionin family [1].

THIONIN is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
thionins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: the motifs span virtually the full alignment length, motif 1
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern THIONIN (PS00271). Two
iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 19 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences.
