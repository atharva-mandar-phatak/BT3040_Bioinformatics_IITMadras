RGSPROTEIN
Regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins are now recognised as key
elements that reduce the signal generated by the binding of hormones,
peptides, or other ligands to G protein coupled receptors. RGS proteins are
GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that function principally by accelerating
the inactivation rate of GTP-bound G protein alpha subunits, by rapidly
returning them to the inactive, GDP-bound state [1].

The RGS family has grown rapidly in the three years since its discovery. To
date, at least 60 different mammalian and invertebrate RGS proteins have
been identified. They all contain a conserved, characteristic RGS domain
(~130 amino acid residues) responsible for their physical interaction with
G protein alpha-subunits. Outside the RGS domain, the sequences show great
diversity, with disparate domain structures. Indeed, recent analysis has
suggested that mammalian RGS proteins may be divided into six
sub-families [2].

RGSPROTEIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn 
from conserved regions spanning the full length of the RGS domain. Two 
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 40 sequences was identified. A number of partial
matches were also found, all of which are believed to be RGS proteins.
