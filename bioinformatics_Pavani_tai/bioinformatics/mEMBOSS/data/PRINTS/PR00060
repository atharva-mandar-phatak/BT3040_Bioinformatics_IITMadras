RIBOSOMALL16
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2].

L16 is a protein from the large (50S) subunit; in E.coli it is located
in the A site of the peptidyltransferase centre [3], and it is known to
bind directly to the 23S rRNA molecule. It belongs to a family of ribosomal
proteins, including L16 from eubacteria, alga and plant chloroplasts,
cyanelles and plant mitochondria.

RIBOSOMALL16 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for L16
ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions encompassing
virtually the full alignment length, motifs 3 and 4 spanning the central
regions encoded by PROSITE patterns RIBOSOMAL_L16_1 (PS00586) and
RIBOSOMAL_L16_2 (PS00701). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 24 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, RL16_BACSU and S25501,
both of which are L16 protein fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 50 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
