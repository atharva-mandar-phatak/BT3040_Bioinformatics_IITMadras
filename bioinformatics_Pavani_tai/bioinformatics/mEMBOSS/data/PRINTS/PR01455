EPMEMPROT2
The epithelial membrane proteins (EMP-1, -2 and -3), peripheral myelin
protein 22 (PMP22), and lens fiber membrane intrinsic protein (LMIP)
comprise a protein family on the basis of their sequence and structural 
similarities [1]. Each family member is a small hydrophobic membrane
glycoprotein, ~160-170 amino acids in length, and shares a common predicted
transmembrane (TM) topology of four TM domains with intracellular N- and 
C-termini [2].

A role for the EMP family members in the control of cell growth has been
suggested [1]. EMP-1 is expressed at high levels in proliferating cells, and
at reduced levels in cells undergoing growth arrest [3]. In contrast, 
PMP22, which is co-expressed with EMP-1 in a range of tissues, displays an
inverse pattern of regulation, with high levels of expression in cultured
cells undergoing growth arrest [3]. It has therefore been proposed that
these proteins may have reciprocal functions in the control of cell
quiescence and proliferation.

EMP-2, previously termed XMP, was identified by expressed sequence tag 
(EST) database searching, pursuing sequences similar to EMP-1 [4]. Mouse
and human isoforms have been cloned. EMP-2 is expressed in a range of
tissues, including ovary, heart, lung and intestine [4]. Although its 
function has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that EMP-2 may be
involved in the regulation of cell proliferation on the basis of its 
sequence similarity to EMP-1 [4].

EPMEMPROT2 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
epithelial membrane protein EMP-2. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved loop
and TM regions, focusing on those sections that characterise epithelial
membrane protein EMP-2 but distinguish it from other family members - motif
1 spans part of the intracellular loop and part of TM domain 3; motif 2 lies
in TM domain 3; motif 3 resides within the second extracellular loop; and 
motif 4 lies in TM domain 4. A single iteration on SPTR39_14f was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
