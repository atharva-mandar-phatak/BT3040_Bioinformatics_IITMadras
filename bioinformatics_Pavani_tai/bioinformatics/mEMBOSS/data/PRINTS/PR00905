MG045FAMILY
Mycoplasma genitalium has the smallest known genome of any free-living 
organism. Its complete genome sequence has been determined by whole-
genome random sequencing and assembly [1]. Only 470 putative coding regions
were identified, including genes for DNA replication, transcription and
translation, DNA repair, cellular transport and energy metabolism [1]. 
A hypothetical protein from the MG045 gene [2] has a homologue of similarly
unknown function in M.pneumoniae [3]; these, in turn, share regions of
similarity with a family of putative lipoproteins from Ureaplasma parvum and
Ureaplasma urealyticum.

MG045FAMILY is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
uncharacterised MG045 lipoprotein family. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on
on SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 15 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also
found, all of which are putative Mycoplasma lipoproteins that fail to make
significant matches with one or more motifs.
