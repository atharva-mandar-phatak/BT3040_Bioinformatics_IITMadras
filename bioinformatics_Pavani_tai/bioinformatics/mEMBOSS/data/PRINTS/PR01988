EXPORTERBACE
The so-called putative bacilysin exporter, bacE, part of the bacilysin
biosynthesis operon, has been shown to be involved in self-protection to
bacilysin [1] by permitting efflux of this antibiotic. 

The protein belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), a class of
single-polypeptide, general substrate carriers that transport small solutes
in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients [2,3]. The primary structure of 
the protein is highly hydrophobic, suggesting the presence of 10-12 trans-
membrane domains. 

EXPORTERBACE is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
putative bacilysin exporter bacE. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 3 sequences - the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, each encoding a 
putative transmembrane domain. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was
identified.
