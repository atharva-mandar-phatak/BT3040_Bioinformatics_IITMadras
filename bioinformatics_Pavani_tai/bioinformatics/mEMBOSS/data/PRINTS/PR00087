LIPOXYGENASE
Lipoxygenases are iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyse the hydro-
peroxidation of lipids containing a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene structure. They
are common in plants, where they are involved in such diverse aspects of 
plant physiology as growth and development, pest resistance and senescence 
or responses to wounding [1]. In mammals, a number of lipoxygenase isozymes
are involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins and leukotrienes [2].

The iron atom in lipoxygenases is bound by 4 ligands, 3 of which are
His residues [3]. In fact there are 6 histidines conserved in all lipoxy-
genases, 5 of which are clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids. This
region contains 2 of the 3 His ligands: the other histidines are believed
to be important for lipoxygenase activity [4].

LIPOXYGENASE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
lipoxygenases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
4 sequences: the motifs span conserved regions in the vicinity of the
clustered histidines - motif 2 includes the first 3 His residues and
corresponds to PROSITE pattern LIPOXYGENASE_1 (PS00711), while motif 3
includes the 4th and 5th His residues and corresponds to PROSITE pattern
LIPOXYGENASE_2 (PS00081). Two iterations on OWL22.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 25 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 70 sequences, and 1
partial match.
