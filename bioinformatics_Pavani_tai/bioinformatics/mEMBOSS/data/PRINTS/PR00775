HEATSHOCK90
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes respond to heat shock and other forms of 
environmental stress by inducing synthesis of heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1].
Within the family of hsps is a group with an average molecular weight of 
90 Kd, the so-called hsp90 proteins. 

The precise function of hsp90 is unclear. In higher eukaryotes, the protein
has been found associated with steroid hormone receptors, tyrosine kinase
oncogene products of various retroviruses, eIF2alpha kinase, and with actin
and tubulin. They are probable chaperonins with ATPase activity [2,3]. The
sequences of hsp90s show a distinctive domain structure, with a highly-
conserved N-terminal domain separated from a conserved, acidic C-terminal
domain by a highly-acidic, flexible linker region.

HEATSHOCK90 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hsp 90 family of heat shock proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 22 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the N-terminal domain - motif 2 includes the region 
encoded by PROSITE pattern HSP90 (PS00298). Three iterations on OWL29.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
70 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are family members, most of which are fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 65 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
