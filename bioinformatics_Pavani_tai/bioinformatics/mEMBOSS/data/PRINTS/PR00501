KELCHREPEAT
Kelch is a 50-residue motif, named after the Drosophila mutant in which
it was first identified [1]. The motif appears 6 times in Drosophila
egg-chamber regulatory protein, and is also found in mouse protein MIPP [1]
and in a number of poxviruses. In addition, kelch repeats have been
recognised in alpha- and beta-scruin [2,3], and in galactose oxidase from
the fungus Dactylium dendroides [4]. The structure of galactose oxidase
reveals that the repeated sequence corresponds to a 4-stranded anti-
parallel beta-sheet motif that forms the repeat unit in a super-barrel
structural fold [5]. 

The known functions of kelch-containing proteins are diverse: scruin is
an actin cross-linking protein; galactose oxidase catalyses the oxidation
of the hydroxyl group at the C6 position in D-galactose; neuraminidase
hydrolyses sialic acid residues from glycoproteins; and kelch may have a
cytoskeletal function, as it is localised to the actin-rich ring canals
that connect the 15 nurse cells to the developing oocyte in Drosophila [2].
Nevertheless, based on the location of the kelch pattern in the catalytic
unit in galactose oxidase, functionally important residues have been
predicted in glyoxal oxidase [4]. 

KELCHREPEAT is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
kelch repeat. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 11
sequences: the motifs span the full repeat length, motif 1 including the
characteristic GG dipeptide and motif 2 a conserved Trp residue. Two
iterations on OWL28.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 17 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found (all are family members, but the multiple repeat nature of
motif has compromised diagnostic performance of the fingerprint). The 
relationship with glyoxal oxidase cannot be resolved from background noise
by this fingerprint. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 32 sequences, and 23
partial matches.
