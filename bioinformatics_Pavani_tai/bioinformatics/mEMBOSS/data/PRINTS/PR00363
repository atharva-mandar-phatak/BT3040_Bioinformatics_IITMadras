CYTOCHROMEB5
Cytochromes b5 (cyt b5) are ubiquitous electron transport proteins found in
animals, plants and yeasts [1,2]. The microsomal and mitochondrial variants
are membrane-bound, while those from erythrocytes and other animal tissues
are water-soluble [3,4]. The 3D structure of bovine cyt b5 is known, the 
fold belonging to the alpha+beta class, with 5 strands and 5 short helices
forming a framework for supporting a central haem group [5]. The haem
domain is similar to that of a number of oxidoreductases, such as plant
and fungal nitrate reductases [6], sulphite oxidase [7], yeast 
flavocytochrome b2 (L-lactate dehydrogenase) [8] and plant cyt b5/acyl 
lipid desaturase fusion protein [9]. Within this domain, 2 conserved His 
residues serve as axial ligands for the haem [5,8]. 

CYTOCHROMEB5 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
cyt b5 and cyt b5-like domains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 24 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 are adjacent, spanning the first
invariant His, which provides one of the haem ligands - within the 
structure, they correspond to beta-strand 4 (32-35) and helix 2 (48-51) of 
bovine cyt b5 [5]; motif 3 spans helix 3 (59-64); and motif 4 spans the
greater part of helix 4 (69-75) and beta-strand 6 (79-83). The second
His residue, which serves as an axial haem ligand, is situated in the
loop of variable length between helices 3 and 4. Two iterations on OWL28.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 79
sequences was identified. Five partial matches were also found, all of 
which fail to make significant matches with motifs 3 or 4: they include 
sunflower cyt b5/acyl lipid desaturase fusion protein (HACYTB5RN) [9], 
rape expressed sequence tag (PQ0816), and 3 yeast hypothetical proteins 
(S54484, SPAC1F129, S52833).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 66 sequences, and 24
partial matches.
