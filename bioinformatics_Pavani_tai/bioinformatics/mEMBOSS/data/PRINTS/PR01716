DEATHASSOCP3
The DAP3 (death associated protein 3) family appear to be positive mediators
of apoptosis. Human DAP3 mediates inteferon-gamma-induced cell death [1], 
and also mediates the effects of Fas and TNF-alpha. The proteins are 
ubiquitously expressed and are localised to the mitochondrial matrix [1,2].

DAP3 contains a potential P-loop motif, suggesting that it might be an
ATP/GTP-binding protein. Mutations in the P-loop region of human DAP3 do 
not affect the overall stability of the protein, but do however reduce its
apoptopic effects by >2-fold [3]. By contrast, mutations in the murine DAP3
P-loop motif do abolish the pro-apoptopic effects [2]. 

DEATHASSOCP3 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
death associated protein 3 (DAP3) family. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 3 spans the putative
nucleotide-binding domain. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences
was identified.
