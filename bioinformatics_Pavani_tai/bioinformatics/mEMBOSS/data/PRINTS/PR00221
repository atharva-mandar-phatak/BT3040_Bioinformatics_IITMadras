CAULIMOCOAT
Caulimoviruses are encapsidated plant viruses that contain circular double-
stranded DNA [1]. Members of the group include cauliflower mosaic virus [2],
carnation etched ring virus [3], figwort mosaic virus [4] and soybean
chlorotic mottle virus [5]. The viral coat proteins are quite similar,
containing a fairly hydrophilic N-terminal region and a highly-basic
C-terminal domain, which may be involved in DNA-binding. The sequences
contain the motif CxxCxxxHxxxC, which is similarly found in the nucleic 
acid binding protein of retroviruses [1].

CAULIMOCOAT is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
caulimovirus coat proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length, motifs 7 and 8 encoding the well-
conserved CxxCxxxHxxxC sequence. Two iterations of OWL23.2 were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was
identified. Three partial matches were also found: these are rice tungro
bacilliform virus polyproteins that contain coat proteins - although there
is little or no correspondence with the rest of the motifs, there is
considerable similarity in the possible DNA-binding region encoded by
motifs 7 and 8.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
