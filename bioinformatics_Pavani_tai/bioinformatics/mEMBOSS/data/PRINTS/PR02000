GCR1PLANT
Heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling via activated 7-transmembrane
(7TM) serpentine receptors is well known in a range of organisms, but 
evidence for the existence of this pathway in plants has been elusive.
Over the years, however, evidence that G proteins are involved in signal 
transduction in plants has been accumulating, leading several researchers
to seek plant 7TM receptors.

The first tangible evidence for a plant 7TM receptor came through an
analysis of the expresssed sequence tag database, dbEST. This revealed 
an Arabidopsis thaliana gene (GCR1) that encodes a protein with 7 predicted
TM domains, and other features characteristic of known 7TM receptors [1,2].
The amino acid sequence of GCR1, however, is unusual in that it shows
similarity to receptors from three different 7TM families [1,2], sharing
greatest levels of similarity with the Dictyostelium cAMP receptors.

GCR1 is expressed at low levels in the roots, stems and leaves of
Arabidopsis. Studies using transgenic Arabidopsis have suggested a 
functional role for GCR1 in cytokinin signal transduction [2].

GCR1PLANT is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
putative plant GPCR, GCR1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 12
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, both of 
which are related proteins that fail to make significant matches with
2 or more motifs.
