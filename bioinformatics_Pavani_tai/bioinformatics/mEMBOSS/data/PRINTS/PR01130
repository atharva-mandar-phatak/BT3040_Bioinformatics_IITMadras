DERENTRNSPRT
Delayed-early response (DER) gene products include growth progression 
factors and several unknown products of novel cDNAs. Murine and human cDNAs
from one novel DER gene (DER12) have been characterised to identify its 
product and to examine its role in the growth response [1]. Both sequences
encode a hydrophobic 36kDa protein that is predicted to contain 8 trans-
membrane (TM) domains. The protein has been localised to the nucleolus,
where its concentration increases following mitogen stimulation [1]. 

Although the function fo the protein is unknown, its identification as a 
nucleolar gene transcriptionally activated by growth factors implicates it
as participating in the proliferative response [1]. Sequence analysis
reveals the protein to share a high degree of similarity with the C-terminal
portion of equilibrative nucleoside transporters.

DERENTRNSPRT is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
delayed-early response proteins, DER12, and equilibrative nucleoside 
transporters. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length: motifs 1-7 and 9 each reside within putative TM
domains. Two iterations on SPTR37_9f were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.
