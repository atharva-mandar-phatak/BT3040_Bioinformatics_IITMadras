MTP2LACTO
Two major structural proteins from the lactococcal temperate bacteriophage
TP901-1 have been sequenced: the Major Head Protein (MHP) and the Major Tail
Protein (MTP) [1]. Homologues of the major tail protein have since been found
in Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus phages. The sequences are
fairly short, typically ~150-200 amino acid residues in length, and are well
conserved. This family of proteins (designated here phage MTP 2) has its own
distinct sequence signature that distinguishes it from the MTP 1 family
(see MTP1FAMILY). 

Sequences belonging to the MTP 2 family are longer than those belonging to
the MTP 1 family, and are well conserved across a range of species. Within
this family, the MTPs of the lactococcal phage are characterised by their
own unique sequence fingerprint.

MTP2LACTO is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
lactococcal phage major tail protein. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR57_40f
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.
