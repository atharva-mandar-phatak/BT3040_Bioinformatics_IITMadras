FILAGGRIN
Filaggrins are filament-associated proteins that interact with keratin
intermediate filaments of terminally differentiating mammalian epidermis
via disulphide bond formation [1]. They show wide species variations and
their aberrant expression has been implicated in a number of keratinising
disorders. The proteins are synthesised as large, insoluble, highly-
phosphorylated precursors, containing multiple tandem repeats of 324 amino
acids, which are not separated by a large linker. The precursor is
deposited as keratohyalin granules. During terminal differentiation, it
is dephosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved.

FILAGGRIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
filaggrins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 17
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the first
two-thirds of the alignment. A single iteration on OWL26.3 was required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 2 sequences was
identified. Numerous partial matches were also found. Most of the database
entries are fragments (including those in the initial alignment), hence the
rather fragmentary nature of the result. Consequently, this is not a
powerful discriminator, but should nevertheless be sufficient to provide
a reasonable diagnostic guide.

An update on OWL31_3 identified a true set of 3 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
