PRPHPHLPASEC
Bacillus cereus contains a monomeric phospholipase C that prefers to act 
on phosphatidylcholine, but also shows weak catalytic activity with 
sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol [1]. Sequence studies have shown 
the protein to be similar both to alpha toxin from Clostridium perfingens
and C.bifermentans, a phospholipase C involved in haemolysis and cell
rupture [2], and to lecithinase from Listeria monocytogenes, which aids
cell-to-cell spread by breaking down the 2-membrane vacuoles that surround
the bacterium during transfer [3].

Each of these proteins is a zinc-dependent enzyme, binding 3 zinc ions per
molecule [4]. The enzymes catalyse the conversion of phosphatidylcholine
and water to 1,2-diacylglycerol and choline phosphate [1,2,4].

PRPHPHLPASEC is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
prokaryotic zinc-dependent phospholipase C. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions largely spanning the central portion of the alignment -
motif 3 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern PROKAR_ZN_DEPEND_PLPC
(PS00384), the 2 conserved histidines and the conserved aspartate of which
provide 3 of the zinc ligands; and motifs 1 and 4 contain other zinc-binding
residues. Two iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was identified. A single
partial match (LIU190352) was also found, a lecithinase fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences.
