BARNASE
Barnase is the extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens,
and barstar its specific intracellular inhibitor [1,2]. Expression of
barstar is necessary to counter the lethal effect of expressed active
barnase. Barnase hydrolyses phosphodiester bonds in RNA, poly- and oligo-
ribonucleotides, resulting in 3'-nucleoside monophosphates via 2',3'-cyclo-
phospate intermediates. It is a small single-chain protein that has
neither disulphide bonds nor non-peptide components. The NMR structure [3]
contains 2 alpha-helices and a 5-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The
protein core is formed by the packing of the first alpha-helix onto the
beta-sheet.  

BARNASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for barnases.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from highly-conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length. Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 32 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
