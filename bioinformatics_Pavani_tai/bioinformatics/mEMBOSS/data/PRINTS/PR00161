NIHGNASECYTB
Bacterial membrane-bound nickel-dependent hydrogenases appear to be
associated with b-type cytochrome [1-3], which is involved in electron
transfer from hydrogen to oxygen. The cytochrome is thought to contain
4 transmembrane (TM) regions, which include several histidine residues
that may be involved in coordination of the haem iron group.

NIHGENASECYTB is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
nickel-dependent hydrogenase b-type cytochrome subunits. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the first 4 motifs
were drawn from the putative TM regions and the fifth includes a C-terminal
hydrophilic domain - motifs 1 and 4 span the regions encoded by PROSITE
patterns NI_HGENASE_CYTB_1 (PS00882) and NI_HGENASE_CYTB_2 (PS00883), both
of which contain conserved His residues. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, a fragment
lacking the last 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences, and 1
partial match.
