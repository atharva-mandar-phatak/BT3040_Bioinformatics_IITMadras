TGFBETA3
The transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta 1-5) constitute a family of
multi-functional cytokines that regulate cell growth and differentiation [1].
Many cells synthesise TGF-beta, and essentially all have specific receptors 
for this peptide [2]. TGF-beta regulates the actions of many other peptide
growth factors and determines a positive or negative direction of their 
effects. The protein functions as a disulphide-linked homodimer. Its
sequence is characterised by the presence of several C-terminal cysteine
residues, which form interlocking disulphide links arranged in a knot-like
topology. A similar "cystine-knot" arrangement has been noted in the
structures of some enzyme inhibitors and neurotoxins that bind to voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels, although the precise topology differs. 

TGF-beta genes are expressed differentially, suggesting that the various TGF-
beta species may have distinct physiological roles in vivo. Examination of
TGF-beta 3 mRNA levels in adult murine tissues indicated that expression is 
predominant in brain, heart, adipose tissue and testis [6]. TGF beta-3 mRNA
is also observed in adult mouse lung and placenta [6]. Research on rat
foetal lung fibroblasts has shown that exposure to cortisol increases TGF-
beta 3 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that
glucocorticoids may mediate their stimulatory effect on lung maturation by
inducing TGF-beta 3 expression in foetal lung fibroblasts [4]. 

The three-dimensional structures of several members of the TGF-beta super-
family have been deduced. The crystal structure of TGF-beta 3 reveals a near
identical central core to that of TGF-beta 2 [5]. The principal differences 
are witnessed in the conformations of the N-terminal alpha-helix and in the
beta-sheet loops [5], which could account for the individual cellular
responses, if these differences are recognised by the TGF-beta receptors.

TGFBETA3 is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
transforming growth factor beta 3 precursor proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on
those sections that characterise TGF-beta 3 proteins but distinguish them
from the rest of the TGF-beta superfamily. A single iteration on SPTR39_14f 
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.
