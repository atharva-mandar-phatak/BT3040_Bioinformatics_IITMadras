DOLALLERGEN
The two principal allergenic proteins in vespid venoms are antigen 5s and
phospholipases [1]. The complete amino acid sequences of the venom
phospholipase A1 from the yellow jacket, Vespula maculifrons, and the more
acidic isoenzyme from the white faced hornet, Dolichovespula maculata, have
been determined [1,2]. The proteins, which contain ~300 amino acid residues,
show no sequence similarity to other known phospholipases, but do have some
similarity to mammalian lipases (~40% identity over 123 residues) [1,2].
Experimental evidence suggests that hornet phospholipase has weak lipase
activity [2].

DOLALLERGEN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for vespid
venom allergen phospholipase A1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those regions 
that characterise the venom phospholipases but distinguish them from related 
lipases. Two iterations on OWL29.6 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are closely related lipases
that match motifs 1 and 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
