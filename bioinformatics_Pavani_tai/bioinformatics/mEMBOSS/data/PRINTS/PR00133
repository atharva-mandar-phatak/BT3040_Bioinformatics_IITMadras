GLHYDRLASE3
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-3] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt).

Family 3 includes fungal and bacterial beta-glucosidases, and the 
hypothetical protein yohA from E.coli. Alignments of such sequences reveal
a number of short conserved regions, one of which contains an aspartic acid
residue, which has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism in beta-
glucosidase from Aspergillus wentii [4].

GLHYDRLASE3 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 3 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in
the N-terminal half of the alignment, motif 5 including the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F3 (PS00775), which contains the active
site Asp. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was identified. Two partial
matches were also found, both of which fail to make significant matches
with 2 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 42 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
