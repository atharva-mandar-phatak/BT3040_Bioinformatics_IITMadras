PROTEINF105A
An approximately 350-residue amino acid polypeptide, designated protein
FAM105A, has been identified in a range of vertebrates. It shares a high
degree of similarity with protein FAM105B, but its function is currently
unknown.

PROTEINF105A is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
protein family FAM105A. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that 
characterise protein FAM105A sequences but distinguish them from the rest
of protein family FAM105. A single iteration on SPTR57_40f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
