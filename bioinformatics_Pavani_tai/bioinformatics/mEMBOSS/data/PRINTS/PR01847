VIRALFUSION
Viral fusion proteins have multiple roles in the biology of viruses. The
fusion protein is required for formation and release of the extracellular
enveloped virus and virus spread [1]. The protein is also involved in the
entry process, acting in virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell fusions [2]. An
important property of the protein is its ability to confer protection
to animals immunised with the purified protein following challenge with
lethal doses of vaccinia virus [3].

Sequence analysis studies on the vaccinia fusion protein reveal the
existence of four regions: an apparent structureless N-terminal region,
followed by a helical region from residues 29-37, a triple coiled region
from residues 44-72, and a leucine zipper motif at the C-terminus [4].

VIRALFUSION is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
viral fusion proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the conserved C-terminal region.
Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 31 sequences was identified.
