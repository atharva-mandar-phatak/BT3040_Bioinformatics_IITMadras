LACYSMPORT
Bacteria contain a number of different sugar transporter families,
including symporters and antiporters [1]. The lacY family of E.coli and
Klebsiella pneumoniae are proton/beta-galactoside symporters, which, like
most sugar transporters, are predicted as having 12 transmembrane (TM)
regions. Also similar to the lacY family are the rafinose (rafB) and
sucrose (cscB) permeases from E.coli [2].

LACYSMPORT is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
lacY proton/sugar symporter family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: motifs were drawn from the TM domains, 
motifs 1-3 TM regions 3-5, and motifs 4-8 regions 7-11 (TM domains 1, 2, 6 
and 12 were too poorly conserved to be included in the fingerprint) - 
motif 1 and motifs 5 and 6 include part of the regions described by PROSITE
patterns LACY_1 (PS00896) and LACY_2 (PS00897). A single iteration on
OWL23.2 was required to reach convergence, no new sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. A single partial match was also found, KPNLAC1, a
lacY protein fragment from Klebsiella.

An update on SPTR57_40f identified a true set of 137 sequences. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are family members that
fail to make significant matches with 2 or more motifs.
