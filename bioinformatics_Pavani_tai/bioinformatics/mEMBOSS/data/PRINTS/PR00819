CBXCFQXSUPER
The Cfx genes in Alcaligenes eutrophus encode a number of Calvin cycle
enzymes [1]. The observed sizes of two of the gene products, CfxX and CfxY,
are 35kDa and 27kDa respectively [1]. No functions could be assigned to
CfxX and CfxY. These proteins show a high degree of similarity to the
B.subtilis stage V sporulation protein K [2].

CBXCFQXSUPER is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
CbxX/CfqX superfamily. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment 
of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the 
C-terminal half of the alignment - motif 2 encodes a putative ATP binding
site. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required to reach convergence, at which 
point a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified. A single partial
match was also found, BCSP5K, a B.cereus stage V sporulation protein that
appears to have its N- and C-terminal domains swapped.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
