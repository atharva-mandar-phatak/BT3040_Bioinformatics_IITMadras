ACTREGSIRT1
Human SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays a role in cell death/
survival, senescence, and endocrine signalling [1]. Its substrates are well
characterised, but evidence for the identity of its direct regulators has 
been wanting. Recently, the nuclear protein AROS (also termed 40S ribosomal
protein S19-binding protein 1 [2]) has been implicated in the direct 
regulation of SIRT1 function - this protein has been dubbed 'active 
regulator of SIRT1 [1]. The protein has been shown to enhance SIRT1-mediated
deacetylation of p53, in vitro and in vivo, and to inhibit p53-mediated
transcriptional activity. It is the first direct SIRT1 regulator to
have been identified that modulates p53-mediated growth regulation [1].

ACTREGSIRT1 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
active regulator of SIRT1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 lie at the 
N- and C-terminal extremities. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond
the starting set. Two partial matches were also found, C3YWE7_BRAFL and
C9JW39_HUMAN, which respectively fail to make signficant matches with motif
2, and with motifs 3 and 4.
