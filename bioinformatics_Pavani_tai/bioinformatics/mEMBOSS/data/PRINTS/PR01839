RAD23PROTEIN
Rad23 is a highly conserved protein involved in nucleotide excision repair 
(NER) [1,2]. It is believed that Rad23 is present in all eukaryotic 
organisms from yeast to mammals [3], and the NER machinery has been 
conserved in structure and function from yeast to humans [4]. In humans,  
defective NER is the underlying cause of the cancer-related disease
xeroderma pigmentosum [4].

In order to facilitate assembly of the DNA repair complex on UV-damaged
DNA, Rad23 binds DNA repair factors that play essential roles in NER and 
specifically interacts with Rad4 [5].

Rad23 possesses an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL(R23)) and a 
C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA). UBLs interact with  
catalytically active 26S proteasomes, while UBAs bind to polyubiquitin  
chains [1,5,6]. A component of the base subcomplex of the regulatory 
particle of the proteasome, Rnp1, specifically recognises the UbL domain 
of Rad23 through its leucine-rich-repeat-like (LRR-like) domain. Thus, UBL  
mediates the binding of Rad23 to proteasomes, which in turn promotes DNA 
repair and modulates protein degradation, possibly by delivering 
ubiquitinylated cargo to proteasomes [7]. The UBA domain is less understood.
It has been shown that the synergistic action of its UBA domains, allows 
Rad23 to interact with ubiquitinated cellular proteins [1,5]. Recently, 
UBA domains have been shown to inhibit 26S proteasome-catalysed proteolysis
by sequestering lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains [6].

RAD23PROTEIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
DNA repair Rad23 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 19 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
toward the C-terminal portion of the alignment - motifs 2-4 span the second
UBA domain. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 22 sequences was identified.
