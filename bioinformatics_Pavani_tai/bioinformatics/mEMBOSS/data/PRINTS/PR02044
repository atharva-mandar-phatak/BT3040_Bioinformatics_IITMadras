FIBROSIN1LPF
AUTS2 is a novel gene identified in a monozygotic twin pair with autism;
its translation product is a large protein containing 1,295 amino acids [1].
Following DNA sequence analysis of autism subjects and controls, no 
autism-specific mutation was observed. Association and linkage analyses
were also negative. It is hence considered unlikely that AUTS2 is an 
autism suspecptibility gene for idiopathic autism, although it may be the
gene responsible for the disorder in the twins in this study [1]. The AUTS2
gene product shares a high level of similarity with the so-called 
fibrosin-1-like protein, a functionally uncharacterised polypeptide that
contains C-terminal Ala-rich and Pro-rich regions.

FIBROSIN1LPF is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
fibrosin-1-like protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on
SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 11 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also
found, B0BMI2_XENTR and Q4V7K7_XENLA, both of which are Xenopus translated
sequences that match motifs 4 and 5.
