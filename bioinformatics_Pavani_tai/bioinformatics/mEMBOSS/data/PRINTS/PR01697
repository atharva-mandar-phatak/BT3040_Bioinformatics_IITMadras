PARVALBUMIN
Fish allergies are common in Europe, particularly among male children and 
young adults. Children allergic to fish react variably to different species.
Cod is among the most common offenders, while salmon is the one best
tolerated. The allergy-eliciting protein has been isolated from the white
muscle albumin. It is a parvalbumin, designated Allergen M. Parvalbumins are
calcium (Ca)-binding proteins of low molecular weight. Like many other 
Ca-binding proteins, they belong to the EF-hand family characterised by
helix-loop-helix (HLH) binding motifs (two helices pack together at an angle
of ~90 degrees, separated by a loop region where calcium binds). In the 
parvalbumin HLH structural motif, calcium is coordinated through one 
carbonyl oxygen atom and the oxygen-containing side-chains of 5 amino acid
residues, or 4 residues and a water molecule [1-3].

Initially, parvalbumins were detected in relatively high amounts in lower
vertebrate white muscle, where they were thought to be important for fibre
relaxation. They were subsequently found, although in lesser amounts, in the
fast twitch skeletal muscles of higher vertebrates, as well as in a variety
of non-muscle tissues, including testis, endocrine glands, skin and specific
neurons. There are two distinct phylogenetic lineages: alpha and beta. Most
muscles contain parvalbumin of only alpha or beta origin. Cod parvalbumin 
belongs to the beta-lineage and shares significant similarity with 
parvalbumin of other fish species [1,3]. 

Allergen M contains 113 residues, is a homogenous acidic protein and belongs
to a group of muscle sarcoplasmic proteins. It carries the major allergenic
determinants associated with cod sensitivity, which is dependent directly on
the linear structure rather than on the molecular conformation. The 
allergenic activity of allergen M resides in particular epitopes found in
three loops: AB (~13-33), CD (~48-64) and EF (~80-103). It has an N-acetyl
terminal amino acid residue and includes 1 residue of glucose attached to 
the conserved N-terminal cysteine, and 1 residue each of tyrosine, 
tryptophan and arginine - the arginine is believed to play a key role in 
maintaining the tertiary structure. Mutation of the last conserved
coordinating residue of the Ca-binding loop (E101D-motif 4) has also been
shown to have a significant impact on the ability of the mutant to obtain
the sevenfold coordination preferred by Ca2+ [1].

PARVALBUMIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the  
parvalbumin family of proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the region
between the AB and CD loops, which comprises the C-terminal 3/4 of helix 2,
helix 3 and the N-terminal 3/4 of helix 4; motif 2 spans the CD loop,
encompassing the first gamma-turn, the fourth-beta turn, helix 5 and the
N-terminal portion of helix 6; motif 3 encodes helix 7; and motif 4
encompasses the EF loop, including the N-terminal portion of the final 
helix. Three iterations on SPTR39_17f were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 40 sequences was identified.
