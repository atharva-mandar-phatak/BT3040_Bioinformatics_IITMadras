INTLKN15MAML
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including 
stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [1]. It is 
required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype - a process that
is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [2]. The numbers of CD8+ memory T cells
in animals may, therefore, be controlled by a balance between IL-15 and -2.

IL-15 has been identified in mammals, birds and fish. Mammalian IL-15s are
expressed in a number of different tissues and cell types. Within the 
immune system, they are mainly produced by monocytes and macrophages [3].

INTLKN15MAML is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
mammalian interleukin-15. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 18 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
20 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found,
Q1AHQ7_MOUSE, a mouse interleukin-15 isoform that fails to match motif 3.
