6PFRUCTKNASE
6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC 2.7.1.105, EC 3.1.3.46) is a bifunctional 
enzyme that catalyses both the synthesis and the degradation of fructose-2,
6-bisphosphate. The fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase reaction involves a 
phosphohistidine intermediate.

ATP + D-fructose 6-phosphate = ADP + D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate   

D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate + H2O = 6-fructose 6-phosphate + orthophosphate

The enzyme is important in the regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism
and is found in greatest quantities in the liver, kidney and heart. In 
mammals, several genes often encode different isoforms, each of which 
differs in its tissue distribution and enzymatic activity [2].

The family described here bears a resemblance to the ATP-driven phospho-
fructokinases. However, they share little sequence similarity, although a 
few residues seem key to their interaction with fructose 6-phosphate [4].

6PFRUCTKNASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 includes strand 3 and the
N-terminus of helix 5; motif 2 spans strand 4 and the N-terminus of helix 6;
motif 3 encompasses the N-terminus of helix 7 and part of the preceding
loop; motif 4 spans strand 6, helix 8 and the N-terminus of strand 7; motif
5 includes strand 7 and helix 9, and includes the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern PG_MUTASE (PS00175); and motif 6 spans helix 13, helix 14 
and the N-terminus of helix 15. Three iterations on OWL30.2 were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 32 sequences was 
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are 
related sequences or fragments that fail to match one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 24 sequences, and 1
partial match.
