GDNFRALPHA3
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its related factors
neurturin (NTN), artemin (ART) and persephin (PSP), are members of the GDNF
family of neurotrophic factors. They form a sub-group in the transforming 
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. These factors are involved in
the promotion of neurone survival, exerting their effects through specific 
receptors.

The GDNF family receptors (GFRs) are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked,
cell surface receptors [1]. Four receptor subtypes, termed GFRalpha-1 to 4,
are currently recognised. GFRalpha-3 has been cloned from mammalian tissue
[2]. It represents the least conserved member of the GFR family in terms of
amino acid sequence, and is activated by artemin [3].

Activation of GFR family members triggers their interaction with the 
membrane bound receptor kinase Ret. This induces Ret homo-dimerisation, 
triggering a cascade of intracellular signalling events such as the 
activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
phosphpinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and 
phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) dependent pathways [1].

GDNFRALPHA3 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
receptor GFRalpha-3. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning 
virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that
characterise GFRalpha-3 but distinguish it from other GFR isoforms -
motif 1 lies towards the N-terminal portion of the alignment; motifs 2
and 3 encode part of the first globular domain; motif 4 resides within 
the second globular domain; and motif 5 lies towards the GPI-anchor part
of the protein. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach 
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
