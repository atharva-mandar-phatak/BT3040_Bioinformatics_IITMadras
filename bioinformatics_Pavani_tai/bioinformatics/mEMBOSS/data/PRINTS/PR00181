MALTOSEBP
Maltodextrin binding protein (MBP) is the primary component of bacterial
high-affinity active transport and chemotaxis [1]. It is a monomeric
protein, with 2 globular domains separated by a 2- or 3-stranded hinge.
MBP binds and transports linear oligosaccharides (of up to 7 glucosyl
units), as well as 2 cyclic maltodextrins which, although binding
tightly, cannot be transported nor initiate a chemotactic response [2].
It is thought that the hinge region is critical for the correct 
functioning of MBP, not just in the binding and recognition of sugars,
but also in allowing and maintaining the integrity of initiation of
both active transport and chemotaxis [3].

MALTOSEBP is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
maltose-binding periplasmic proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL25.2
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
