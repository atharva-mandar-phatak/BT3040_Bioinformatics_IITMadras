KIR33CHANNEL
Potassium channels are found in virtually all cell types. Their pore-
forming subunits fall into three structural families, i.e. those possessing
six, four and two transmembrane (TM) domains. The six-TM domain K+ channels
can be further subdivided into six families: the voltage-gated K+ channels
(Kv), the KCNQ channels, the eag-like K+ channels, and three Ca2+-activated
K+ channels. Inwardly-rectifying K+ channels (Kir) are the principal class
of two-TM domain K+ channels, and the recently-discovered two-pore domain
K+ channels, make up a family of four-TM domain K+ channels.

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are responsible for regulating
diverse processes including: cellular excitability, vascular tone, heart
rate, renal salt flow, and insulin release [1]. To date, around twenty
members of this superfamily have been cloned, which can be grouped into six
families by sequence similarity - these are designated Kir1.x-7.x [2,3].

Cloned Kir channel cDNAs encode proteins of between ~370-500 residues,
containing two predicted TM domains, with the characteristic K+ channel
pore-forming domain located between them. Both N- and C-termini are thought
to be cytoplasmic, and the N-terminus lacks a signal sequence. It is thought
that four Kir subunits assemble to form a tetrameric channel complex, which
may be hetero- or homomeric [1].

The Kir3.x channel family are gated by G proteins following G protein
coupled receptor (GPCR) activation. They are widely distributed in
neuronal, atrial, and endocrine tissues and play key roles in generating
late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, slowing the heart rate and
modulating hormone release. They are directly activated by G protein
beta-gamma subunits released from G protein heterotrimers of the G(i/o)
family upon appropriate receptor stimulation.

Kir3.3 does not generate receptor-evoked, or constitutively-active K+
currents, when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It may
therefore contribute to Kir channel diversity by associating with other
Kir3.x family members [2].

KIR33CHANNEL is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Kir3.3 inward rectifier K+ channel. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise Kir3.3 but distinguish it from other subtypes -
motif 1 encodes the first 15 residues of the putative cytoplasmic
N-terminus; motif 2 spans the end of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and
the start of the following first TM domain; and motifs 3-5 encode portions
of the cytoplasmic C-terminus. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond
the starting set.
