SPIKEPROTEIN
The glycoproteins of viral haemorrhagic scepticaemia virus [1] and of
infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus [2] are similar, and are responsible 
for forming spikes on the surface of the virion. The glycoprotein mediates 
binding of the virus to susceptible host cells and induces uptake of the
virus by the cell. The interaction between the internal components of the
virion and the portion of the glycoprotein exposed on the cytoplasmic face
of the plasma membrane probably directs envelopment and virus budding.

SPIKEPROTEIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for this
family of viral spike glycoproteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 18 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 26
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are fragments that lack the N- and C-terminal motifs. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 26 sequences.
