RIBOSOMALL27
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2]. 

L27 is a protein from the large (50S) subunit; it is essential for ribosome
function, but its exact role is unclear. It belongs to a family of ribosomal
proteins, including L27 from eubacteria and plant and red alga chloroplasts,
and YmL2 protein from yeast mitochondria.

RIBOSOMALL27 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for L27
ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions encompassing
the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the central region
encoded by PROSITE pattern RIBOSOMAL_L27 (PS00831). Two iterations on
OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 6 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 26 sequences.
