GLHYDRLASE10
Fungi and bacteria produce a spectrum of cellulases and xylanases for the
degradation of cellulase and xylans [1,2]. Using sequence similarity
criteria, the enzymes can be grouped into families, one of which has been
referred to as cellulase family F [3] or glycosyl hydrolase family 10 [4,5]
(http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?glycosid.txt). This family includes
fungal and bacterial endo-1,4-beta-xylanases and endo-1,3-beta-xylosidases.
Alignments of such sequences reveal a number of short conserved regions,
one of which contains a glutamic acid residue, which in exoglucanase from
Cellulomonas fimi has been shown to be involved in glycosidic bond cleavage
[6].

GLHYDRLASE10 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 10 glycosyl hyrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length (the active site motif encoded
by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F10 (PS00591) was not included as it was
not present in all sequences). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 27 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, each of which fails to
make significant matches with 2 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 66 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
