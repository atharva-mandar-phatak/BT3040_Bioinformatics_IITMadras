BACSURFANTGN
Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves 
transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell 
exterior [1]. There have been four secretion systems described in 
animal enteropathogens such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further 
sequence homologies in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [1]. 

The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to 
transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell 
[1] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with
the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of 
bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [1]. However, while the latter forms a
ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of
the flagella itself [1], type III subunits in the outer membrane translocate 
secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.

Exotoxins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal,
and are considered unique because of this [1]. Yersinia pestis secretes such 
a protein, as recently described [2]. YopT is injected into the host cell 
upon contact, and is therefore considered to be a virulence factor [2]. 
Haemophilus spp. express a similar toxin on their surface, a 76kDa
antigen [2].

BACSURFANTGN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
the Yersinia/Haemophilus type III secreted virulence surface antigen family. 
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length 
(~800 amino acids). A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
Two partial matches were also found, Q9ZHL0 and Q9ZHL3, both Haemophilus
type III surface antigens that fail to match motifs 1 and 2.
