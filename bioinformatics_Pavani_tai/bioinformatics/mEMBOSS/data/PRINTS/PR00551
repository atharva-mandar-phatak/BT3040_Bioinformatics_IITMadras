2SGLOBULIN
All legume seeds contain storage globulins, a family of proteins of 
different size and structural organisation that share several properties
(including similar amino acid composition, salting-in solubility, etc.) 
[1,2]. The globulins are generally classified with respect to their
molecular mass as 2S, 7S (vicilin) or 11S (legumin). Narbonin belongs to
the smaller, 2S globulins: it is a monomer of 290 amino acid residues and
consists of a single polypeptide chain [1,2].

Narbonin folds as an beta/alpha-protein, with strands and helices alternating
to form an 8-stranded parallel beta-barrel surrounded by a ring of 7 helices
[1,2], the familiar topology of triose phosphate isomerase and many other
enzymes. To date, attempts to identify an enzymatic activity for this
protein, however, have failed [1].

2SGLOBULIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for narbonin
and narbonin-like 2S globulins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 encode strands 1 and 2
res.; motif 4 encodes strand 3; motifs 5 and 6 span helix 3 and strand 4;
motif 7 spans strand 6 and part of helix 6; and motifs 8 and 9 span helix 7
and strand 8. Two iterations on OWL28.1 were required to reach convergence, 
at which point a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
