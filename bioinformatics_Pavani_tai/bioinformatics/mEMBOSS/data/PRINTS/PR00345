STATHMIN
Stathmin is a ubiquitous phosphorylated protein thought to act as an
intracellular relay for diverse regulatory pathways [1], functioning
through a variety of second messengers. Its phosphorylation and gene
expression are regulated throughout development [2] and in response to
extracellular signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and
function [3]. Stathmin, and the related proteins SCG10 and XB3, contains a
N-terminal domain (XB3 contains an additional N-terminal hydrophobic
region), a 78 amino acid coiled-coil region, and a short C-terminal domain.

STATHMIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
stathmins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motif 2 including the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern STATHMIN (PS00563), which corresponds to a well-conserved deca-
peptide containing the first 3 coiled coil residues. Two iterations on
OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 9 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences.
