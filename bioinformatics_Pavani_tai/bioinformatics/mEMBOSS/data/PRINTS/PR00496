NAPIN
Napins are low-molecular weight, basic storage proteins synthesised in
rape-seed embryos during seed maturation [1,2]. Sequence comparisons have
revealed that napin belongs to a diverse protein family, which includes
major allergens, trypsin inhibitors and natural anti-fungal proteins.

Napin comprises 2 polypeptide chains (MW 9000 and 4000) held together by
disulphide bonds. The protein is initially synthesised as a precursor of
178 residues, which is proteolytically cleaved to generate mature napin
chains, with 86 and 29 residues respectively.

NAPIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the napin
family of seed storage proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on
OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 33 sequences was identified. Five partial matches were also
found: these include the related mabinlins, which fail to match motifs 3
and/or 4; and a grain-softness protein, which matches motifs 2 and 4. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 20 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
