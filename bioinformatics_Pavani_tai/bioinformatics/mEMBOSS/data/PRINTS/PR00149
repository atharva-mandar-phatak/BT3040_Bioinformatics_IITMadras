FUMRATELYASE
A number of lyases, for which fumarate is the substrate, have been shown
to share a short conserved region centred around a methionine, which is
probably involved in the catalytic activity [1,2]. These enzymes include
class II fumarases, aspartases, adenylosuccinases, argininosuccinate
lyases and 3-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate cycloisomerases. Delta-crystallin 
shares around 90% sequence identity with argininosuccinate lyase, showing 
that it is an example of a 'hijacked' enzyme [3]. 

FUMRATELYASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
members of the fumarate lyase superfamily. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions within the central part of the alignment, motif 4
including the region ecoded by PROSITE pattern FUMARATE_LYASES (PS00163),
which contains the conserved methionine in the putative catalytic centre.
Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 38 sequences was identified. Two partial
matches were also found, PUR8_ECOLI and ECOADENLY, both of which are
adenylosuccinate lyases that fail to make significant matches with
motifs 1 and 3. 

An update on SPTR55_38f  identified a true set of 2838 sequences, and 
numerous partial matches, all of which are superfamily members that
fail to match one or two of the motifs.
