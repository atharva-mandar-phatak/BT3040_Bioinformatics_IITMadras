CYSSERRICHNP
Members of the cysteine/serine-rich nuclear protein family (CSRNP) contain
cysteine- and serine-rich regions and a basic domain. They possess a
transcriptional activation domain, and bind the sequence AGAGTG [1,2]. The
proteins actively influence transcriptional activity, but it has not been
established which of their domains are involved in DNA binding. It is
thought that this may potentially be mediated by the conserved cysteine-rich
or the basic domain [1,2].  

It has been shown that CSRNP genes are down-regulated in various different
cancers, suggesting that they act as tumour suppressors [1]. This would 
usually imply a relation to reduced apoptosis, but this has yet to be 
proven; in some studies, a reduction in apoptosis was not detected as 
a result of deficiencies of CSRNP genes [1].

CYSSERRICHNP is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
cysteine/serine-rich nuclear protein (CSRNP) family. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 33 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 2 and 3
encode the Cys-rich region. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 39 sequences was 
identified.
