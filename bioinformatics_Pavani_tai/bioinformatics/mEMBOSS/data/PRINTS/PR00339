PCNACYCLIN
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), or cyclin, is a non-histone
acidic nuclear protein [1] that plays a key role in the control of
eukaryotic DNA replication [2]; it acts as a co-factor for DNA polymerase
delta, which is responsible for leading strand DNA replication [3]. The
sequence of PCNA is well conserved between plants and animals, indicating a
strong selective pressure for structure conservation, and suggesting that
this type of DNA-replication mechanism is conserved throughout eukaryotes
[4]. Homologues of PCNA have also been identified in yeast and baculovirus.

PCNACYCLIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
cyclins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length, motif 3 including the N-terminal region encoded by
PROSITE pattern PCNA (PS00293), which may be involved in DNA binding. Two 
iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 14 sequences was identified. A single partial match was 
also found, PCNA_SOYBN, a soybean PCNA fragment that lacks the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
