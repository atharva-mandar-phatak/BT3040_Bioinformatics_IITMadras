DISHEVELLED2
Wnt proteins constitute a large family of secreted signalling molecules that
are involved in intercellular signalling during development. The name 
derives from the first 2 members of the family to be discovered: int-1 
(mouse) and wingless (Wg) (Drosophila) [1]. It is now recognised that Wnt 
signalling controls many cell fate decisions in a variety of different 
organisms, including mammals [2]. Wnt signalling has been implicated in 
tumorigenesis, early mesodermal patterning of the embryo, morphogenesis of 
the brain and kidneys, regulation of mammary gland proliferation and 
Alzheimer's disease [3,4].

Wnt signal transduction proceeds initially via binding to their cell
surface receptors - the so-called frizzled proteins. This activates the
signalling functions of B-catenin and regulates the expression of specific
genes important in development [5]. More recently, however, several non-
canonical Wnt signalling pathways have been elucidated that act
independently of B-catenin [6]. In both cases, the transduction mechanism
requires dishevelled protein (Dsh), a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that acts
directly downstream of frizzled [7]. In addition to its role in Wnt
signalling, Dsh is also involved in generating planar polarity in Drosophila
and has been implicated in the Notch signal transduction cascade. Three 
human and mouse homologues of Dsh have been cloned (DVL-1 to 3); it is 
believed that these proteins, like their Drosophila counterpart, are 
involved in signal transduction. Human and murine orthologues share more 
than 95% sequence identity and are each 40-50% identical to Drosophila Dsh.

Sequence similarity amongst Dsh proteins is concentrated around three 
conserved domains: at the N-terminus lies a DIX domain (mutations 
mapping to this region reduce or completely disrupt Wg signalling); a PDZ 
(or DHR) domain, often found in proteins involved in protein-protein 
interactions, lies within the central portion of the protein (point 
mutations within this module have been shown to have little effect on 
Wg-mediated signal transduction); and a DEP domain is located towards the C-
terminus and is conserved among a set of proteins that regulate various 
GTPases (whilst genetic and molecular assays have shown this module to be 
dispensible for Wg signalling, it is thought to be important in planar 
polarity signalling in flies [7,8]).

Mouse DVL-2 was first cloned in 1996 [9], followed by the human orthologue 
in 1997 [4]. Both the human and murine genes encode polypeptides of 736 
amino acids, the human protein sharing 73% identity with Xenopus Dsh.
Immunoblotting analysis of human DVL-2 in human embryonic tissues showed
the protein to be abundantly expressed in the lung, less prevalent in the 
kidney, and present at very low level in thymus, liver and intestinal 
tissues [4]. 

DISHEVELLED2 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
dishevelled-2 (DVL-2) proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that 
characterise DVL-2 proteins but distinguish them from closely related 
members of the Dsh family - motif 1 lies at the N-terminus, within the 
putative DIX domain; motif 2 includes part of the C-terminal portion of the 
putative DEP domain; and motifs 3 and 4 reside at the C-terminus. A single 
iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence, no further 
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
