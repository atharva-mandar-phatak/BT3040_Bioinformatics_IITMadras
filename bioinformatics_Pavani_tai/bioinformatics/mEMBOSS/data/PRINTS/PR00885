BCTERIALGSPH
The general (type II) secretion pathway (GSP) within Gram-negative bacteria
is a signal sequence-dependent process repsonsible for protein export
[1-3]. The process has two stages: exoproteins are first translocated
across the inner membrane by the general signal-dependent export pathway
(GEP), and then across the outer membrane by a species-specific accessory
mechanism.

A number of proteins are involved in the GSP; one of these is known as
protein H (GSPH protein). This protein shares several sequence similarities
with bacterial fimbrial protein, or pilin, the major structural protein of
pili [4]. Pili are polar flexible filamentous adhesions ~2500nm in length, 
and diameter ~5.4nm. Fimbrial and GSPG proteins share the following
characteristics: a methylated, hydrophobic N-terminal residue; a
hydrophobic leader peptide of 5-10 residues, terminating with glycine;
glutamate as the fifth residue of the mature sequence; and a highly
hydrophobic N-terminus.

BCTERIALGSPH is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial general secretion pathway protein H family. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 were drawn
from the hydrophobic N-terminal section, motif 1 including the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern PROKAR_NTER_METHYL (PS00409), in which the
conserved glycine is methylated; and motif 3 lies in the C-terminal region.
Two iterations on OWL30.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were
also found, ECRECC1 and PPDB_ECOLI, both of which are prepilin proteins that
match motifs 1 and 3.

An update on SPTR57_40f identified a true set comprising 75 sequences, 
together with 18 partial matches.
