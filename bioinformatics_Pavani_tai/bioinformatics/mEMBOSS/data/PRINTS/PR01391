BINARYTOXINB
A large group of bacterial exotoxins are referred to as "A/B toxins", 
essentially because they are formed from two subunits [1]. The "A" subunit
possesses enzyme activity, and is transferred to the host cell following
a conformational change in the membrane-bound transport "B" subunit [1].

Clostridial species are one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastro-
intestinal illnesses. They are Gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur
naturally in the soil [1]. Included in the family are: C.botulinum, which
produces one of the most potent toxins in existance; C.tetani, causative
agent of tetanus; and C.perfringens, commonly found in wound infections
and diarrhoea cases. 

Among the toxins produced by certain Clostridium spp. are the binary 
exotoxins. These proteins consist of two independent polypeptides, which
correspond to the A/B subunit moieties. The enzyme component (A) enters 
the cell through endosomes produced by the oligomeric binding/translocation
protein (B), and prevents actin polymerisation through ADP-ribosylation of 
monomeric G-actin [1-3].

Members of the "B" binary toxin family include C.perfringens iota toxin Ib
[1], C.botulinum C2 toxin CII [2], and C.difficile ADP-ribosyltransferase 
[3]. The Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) protein also shares a
high degree of similarity with this family [1], and similar proteins have 
been found in C.spiroforme [2,3].

Bacillus anthracis, a large Gram-positive spore-forming rod, is the 
causative agent of anthrax [4]. Its two virulence factors are the 
poly-D-glutamate polypeptide capsule, and the actual anthrax exotoxin [5].
The toxin comprises three factors: the protective antigen (PA); the oedema
factor (EF) [4]; and the lethal factor (LF) [6]. Each is a thermolabile 
protein of ~80kDa. PA forms the "B" part of the exotoxin and allows passage
of the "A" moiety (consisting of EF and LF) into target cells.

PA protein forms the central part of the complete anthrax toxin, and 
translocates the B moiety into host cells after assembling as a heptamer in
the membrane [5,7]. Each monomer consists of 47 beta-strands and 14 alpha-
helices, which are arranged into 4 separate domains. The first monomer binds
the A moiety before insertion into the host cell. Several proteins with
similar functions have been identified: these include the actin-specific
ADP-ribosyltransferase binary and iota toxins from several Clostridial spp.,
and the C.difficile C2 toxin.

The crystal structure of monomeric PA has been determined to 2.1A resolution
and the water-soluble heptamer to 4.5A resolution [8]. The monomer mainly 
contains anti-parallel beta-sheets and has 4 domains: an N-terminal domain
containing 2 calcium ions and the cleavage site for activating proteases;
a heptamerisation domain containing a large flexible loop implicated in
membrane insertion; a small domain of unknown function; and a C-terminal
receptor-binding domain [8]. Removal of a 20K N-terminal fragment from 
the N-terminal domain allows assembly of the heptamer, a ring-shaped 
structure with a negatively charged lumen, and exposes a large hydrophobic 
surface for binding the toxic enzymes [8]. A model of pH-dependent membrane
insertion involving the formation of a porin-like, membrane-spanning 
beta-barrel has been proposed [8].

BINARYTOXINB is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
binary toxin B protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment length - motifs 1-5 span the
PA protein calcium-binding domain; motifs 6-11 span the heptamerisation
domain; and motif 12 resides in the C-terminal domain. Two iterations on
SPTR39_15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 8 sequences was identified.
