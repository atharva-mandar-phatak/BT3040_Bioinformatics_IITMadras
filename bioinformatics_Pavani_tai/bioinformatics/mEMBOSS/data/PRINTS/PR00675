MAREKSGPA
Herpesviruses have been implicated as a cause of tumours in a number of
species. The common tumour condition of the fowl is caused by Marek's
disease Herpesvirus (MDHV). Although infection is ubiquitous, only a
proportion of fowl develop tumours, and the precise details of the process
of tumour induction remains to be elucidated.

Secretory glycoprotein GP57-65 precursor (glycoprotein A - GA) is thought
to play an immunoevasive role in the pathogenesis of Marek's disease. It is
a candidate for causing the early-stage immunosuppression that occurs after
MDHV infection. The protein is predominantly secreted, but a small amount
of mature GP57-65 is anchored in the plasma membrane, or held by other
interactions. GA is similar to Herpesvirus glycoprotein C, and belongs to
the immunoglobulin gene superfamily [1,2].

MAREKSGPA is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Marek's disease glycoprotein A. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on
OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 7 sequences was identified. Four partial matches were also
found: VGLC_HSVTF is a fragment lacking the portion of sequence bearing
the final 2 motifs; and the rest are closely related glycoprotein
homologues. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
