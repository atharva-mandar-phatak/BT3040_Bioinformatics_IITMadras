Y06768FAMILY
Mycoplasma genitalium has the smallest known genome of any free-living 
organism. Its complete genome sequence has been determined by whole-
genome random sequencing and assembly [1]. Only 470 putative coding regions
were identified, including genes for DNA replication, transcription and
translation, DNA repair, cellular transport and energy metabolism [1]. 
One family of hypothetical proteins, which includes products of the
MG067/MG068/MG395 genes, has been shown to have homologues of similarly
unknown function in M.pneumoniae [2].

Y06768FAMILY is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
the Mycoplasma MG067/MG068/MG395 family of hypothetical proteins. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length - motif 5 lies in a region that bears some similarity to the
conserved serine active site motif of the V8 family of serine proteases
(cf. PROSITE pattern V8_SER (PS00673)). Two iterations on OWL30.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
