CMYCBINDINGP
AMY1-1 (Associate of Myc-1) has been identified as a c-Myc-binding protein
that stimulates c-Myc transcription [1-3]. AMY-1 binds to the Myc box II
via the N-proximal region of c-Myc, a transcriptional activation region of
c-Myc, and stimulates E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc [2]. 

The protein has also been shown to bind to the regulatory subunit II binding
region of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchor protein 149 (AKAP149) and
S-AKAP84, an AKAP149 splice variant expressed in the testis [2]. It was 
found to localise in the mitochondria of HeLa and sperm, in association with
AKAP149 and S-AKAP84, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis [2]. It has also
been reported to be translocated from the cytoplasm, with c-Myc, into the
nucleus once the cell cycle has entered S-phase, suggesting that AMY-1
may be a co-activator for c-Myc [4].

CMYCBINDINGP is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for  
c-Myc-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 53 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Three iterations on SPTR57_40f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 69
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of 
which are suspected family members.
