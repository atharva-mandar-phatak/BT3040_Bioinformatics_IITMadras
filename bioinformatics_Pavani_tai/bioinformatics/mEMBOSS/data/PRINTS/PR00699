TMPROTEINSRB
Animals recognise a wide variety of chemicals using their senses of taste
and smell. The nematode C.elegans has only 14 types of chemosensory neuron,
yet is able to respond to dozens of chemicals because each neuron detects
several stimuli. More than 40 highly divergent transmembrane proteins that
could contribute to this functional diversity have been described [1]. Most
of the candidate receptor genes are in clusters of similar genes; 11 of 
these appear to be expressed in small subsets of chemosensory neurons. A
single type of neuron can potentially express at least 4 different receptor
genes [1]. Some of these might encode receptors for water-soluble
attractants, repellents and pheromones, which may be divergent members
of the G protein-coupled receptor family [1].

Sequences of the srb family of C.elegans receptor-like proteins contain
6-8 hydrophobic, putative transmembrane, regions. These can be
distinguished from other 7TM proteins (especially those known to couple
G proteins) by their own characteristic TM signatures.

TMPROTEINSRB is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
C.elegans srb family of integral membrane proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from the putative TM regions. A single iteration on OWL29.1 was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set. Several partial matches were found, all of which are homologues that
show certain differences in their TM signatures.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
