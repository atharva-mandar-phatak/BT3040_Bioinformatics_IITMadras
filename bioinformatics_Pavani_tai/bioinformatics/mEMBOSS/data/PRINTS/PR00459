ASPEROXIDASE
Peroxidases are haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions.
Most haem peroxidases follow the reaction scheme:

Fe(3+) + H2O2            --> [Fe(4+)=O]R' (Compound I) + H2O
[Fe(4+)=O]R' + substrate --> [Fe(4+)=O]R (Compound II) + oxidised substrate
[Fe(4+)=O]R  + substrate -->  Fe(3+) + H2O + oxidised substrate

In this mechanism, the enzyme reacts with one equivalent of H2O2 to give 
[Fe(4+)=O]R' (compound I). This is a two-electron oxidation/reduction 
reaction where H2O2 is reduced to water and the enzyme is oxidised. One 
oxidising equivalent resides on iron, giving the oxyferryl [Fe(4+)=O] 
intermediate, while in many peroxidases the porphyrin (R) is oxidised to 
the porphyrin pi-cation radical (R'). Compound I then oxidises an organic 
substrate to give a substrate radical [1].

Peroxidases are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. On the basis
of sequence similarity, fungal, plant and bacterial peroxidases can be
viewed as members of a superfamily consisting of 3 major classes [2]. Class
I, the intracellular peroxidases, includes yeast cytochrome c peroxidase
(CCP), ascorbate peroxidase (AP) and bacterial catalase-peroxidases.

In chloroplasts of higher plants, oxygen consumption in the absence of
electron acceptors is accompanied by production of H2O2 and activated
forms of oxygen. Chloroplasts contain several protective systems (such as
superoxide dismutase (SOD), alpha-tocopherol and carotenoids), which are
effective against various forms of activated oxygen. However, they lack
catalase, and the disposal of H2O2 is accomplished by other means [3].

Ascorbic acid is a strong antioxidant that is effective in scavenging 
superoxide (O2-'), hydroxyl (OH') radicals and singlet oxygen. It can
also remove H2O2 in the following reaction:
       Ascorbate + H2O2  --> dehydroascorbate + 2 H2O
Ascorbate peroxidase (AP) is the main enzyme responsible for hydrogen
peroxide removal in the chloroplasts and cytosol of higher plants [3].

The 3D structure of pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase has an overall fold
virtually identical to that of CCP [4]. The protein consists of 2 all-alpha
domains, between which is embedded the haem group. The most pronounced
difference between the AP and CCP structures is the absence of an anti-
parallel beta-hairpin between the G and H helices in the AP molecule.

ASPEROXIDASE is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
ascorbate peroxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 2 encodes the B helix
and contains invariant active site residues (Arg, Phe and the "distal" His)
that form a ligand pocket for hydrogen peroxide (cf. motif 1 of signature
PEROXIDASE and PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_2 (PS00436)); motifs 4 and 5 
encode the C and D helices, respectively; motifs 5 and 6 correspond to
motifs 2 and 3 of PRINTS signature PEROXIDASE; motif 8 contains the
invariant "proximal" His, which serves the axial ligand of the haem iron
(cf. PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_1 (PS00435) and motif 4 of signature
PEROXIDASE); motif 9 corresponds to motif 5 of signature PEROXIDASE; and 
motifs 10 and 11 span the H, I and J helices. Two iterations on OWL27.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 13
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found: the most
similar sequence is yeast CCP, which lacks motifs 1 and 3; the remaining
sequences, i.e. those matching 3 or 4 motifs and most of those matching 
just 2, belong to the fungal, plant and bacterial peroxidase superfamily.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 26 sequences, and 16
partial matches.
