CASNKINASEII
Casein kinase, a ubiquitous, well-conserved protein kinase involved in
cell metabolism and differentiation [1,2], is characterised by its 
preference for Ser or Thr in acidic stretches of amino acids [1,2]. The
enzyme is a tetramer of 2 alpha- and 2 beta-subunits [1,2]. However, some
species (e.g., mammals) possess 2 related forms of the alpha-subunit (alpha
and alpha'), while others (e.g., fungi) possess 2 related beta-subunits
(beta and beta') [3]. 

The alpha-subunit is the catalytic unit and contains regions characteristic
of serine/threonine protein kinases [1,2]. The beta-subunit is believed to
be regulatory, possessing an N-terminal auto-phosphorylation site, an
internal acidic domain, and a potential metal-binding motif [3]. The
mammalian beta-subunit gene promoter shares common features with those of
other mammalian protein kinases and is closely related to the promoter of
the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase [3].

CASNKINASEII is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the casein kinase II regulatory subunit. The fingerprint was derived from 
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 4 and 5
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern CK2_BETA (PS01101), a
Cys-rich region that may be involved in binding a metal ion such as zinc.
Two iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 15 sequences was identified. A single partial match
(DROSUSTEB) was also found, a Drosophila stellate supressor protein fragment
lacking the portion of sequence bearing the last 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences.
