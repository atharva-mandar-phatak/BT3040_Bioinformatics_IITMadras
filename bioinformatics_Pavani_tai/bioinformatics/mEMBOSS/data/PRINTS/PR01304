NORRIEDSEASE
Norrie disease is a severe, X-linked, recessive neurodevelopmental disorder
characterised by progressive atrophy of the eyes, deafness and mental 
retardation [1,2]. The Norrie disease gene is expressed in retina, choroid
and foetal brain [2]. X-linked Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (XLFEVR)
is a hereditary eye disorder that affects both the retina and the vitreous
body and is characterised by abnormal vascularisation of the peripheral
retina [3]. It has been shown that phenotypes of both XLFEVR and Norrie
disease can result from mutations in the same gene [3].

Norrie disease protein (NDP) is thought to have a tertiary structure
similar to that of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) [4].
Molecular modelling studies have suggested that NDP is a member of an
emerging family of growth factors containing a cystine knot motif [4].
NDP is thought to be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell
differentiation and proliferation, and may have a role in neuroectodermal
cell-cell interaction.

NORRIEDSEASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Norrie disease proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 resides at the N-terminus; 
and motifs 2-6 span the disulphide-linked domain. A single iteration on
SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.
