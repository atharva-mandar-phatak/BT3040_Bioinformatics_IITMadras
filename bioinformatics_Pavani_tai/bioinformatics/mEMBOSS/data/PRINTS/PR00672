INHIBINBC
Inhibins and activins are dimeric peptide hormones that regulate circulating
levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [1,2]. In turn, FSH stimulates
inhibin gene expression in the ovarian follicle [2]; this effect is
probably mediated by cAMP [3]. Inhibin is a heterodimer, linked by one or
more disulphide bonds: inhibin A is a dimer of alpha and beta-A chains;
inhibin B is a dimer of alpha and beta-B; activin A is a dimer of beta-A;
and activin AB is a dimer of beta-A and beta-B. Inhibins belong to a gene
family that also includes transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [3].

INHIBINBC is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
inhibin beta-C chains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. A single iteration on
OWL29.1 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found, both
of which are fragments: JC415 is an activin beta-D chain and IHBB_RAT is
an inhibin beta-B chain.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
