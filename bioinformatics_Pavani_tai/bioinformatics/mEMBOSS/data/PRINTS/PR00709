AVIDIN
Avidin is a minor egg white component in several groups of oviparous
vertebrates [1]; streptavidin is its bacterial homologue. The protein 
is characterised by its very tight (avid) binding to biotin, from where it 
derives its key role in biotechnology. Avidin has also been found as a
domain in sea-urchin cell surface proteins. 

Structurally and functionally the protein is closely related to the 
lipocalins, which are members of the calycin superfamily [2]; these are 
characterised by their high specificity for small hydrophobic molecules [3].

The crystal structures of avidin and avidin-biotin complexes have been 
solved, and reveal the characteristic lipocalin-like 8-stranded anti-
parallel beta-barrel. The protein forms a homotetrameric assembly of
non-covalently associated chains, each of which forms a strong and
specific non-covalent complex with one molecule of biotin.  

AVIDIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for avidins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length - motif 1 spans beta-strands 1 and 2; motif 2 encodes 
strand 3; motif 3 includes strand 5; motif 4 encodes strand 6; motif 5 spans
the C-terminal half of strand 7; and motif 6 spans helix 1 and strand 8. Two
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.
