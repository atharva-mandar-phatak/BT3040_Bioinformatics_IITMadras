NEISSPPORIN
Porins are found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria,
mitochondria and chloroplasts, where they form ion-selective channels for 
small hydrophilic molecules (up to ~600 Da) [1,2]. X-ray structure
analyses of several bacterial porins [3-5] have revealed a large 16-stranded
anti-parallel beta-barrel structure enclosing the transmembrane pore, by
contrast with all other integral membrane proteins described to date, 
which are alpha-helical. Three subunits form a trimer; the 3-fold axis is 
approximately parallel to the barrel axes and is assumed to be
perpendicular to the membrane plane [6].  

From the range of porins now known, similarities have been observed between
porins from different species, and between porins of different specificity
within the same species. But most porins cannot be related to each other on
the basis of sequence alone, and this is reflected in the lengths of the 
known porin sequences, which range from 282-483 residues/monomer.

NEISSPPORIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
porins from Neisseria species. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: motif 7 includes the consensus encoded in 
PROSITE pattern GRAM_NEG_PORIN (PS00576). Two iterations on OWL19.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 39 
sequences was identified. Note that motif 6 alone is matched by the porin 
from Rhodobacter capsulatus (PORI_RHOCA), whose sequence is otherwise 
quite different from other known classes of porin and is thus not 
identified by any of our porin signatures.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 57 sequences.
