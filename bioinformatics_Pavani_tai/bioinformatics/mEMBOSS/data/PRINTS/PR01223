BRIDEOF7LESS
During development of the Drosophila retina, the bride of sevenless (boss)
gene is required in photoreceptor neuron R8 for the development of
photoreceptor neuron R7, suggesting that boss encodes or regulates an
R7-specific inductive cue [1]. The induction of R8 photoreceptor neuron
neighbouring cells to assume an R7 cell fate is believed to be mediated by
a direct interaction of boss with sevenless [1,2]. An alternative model has
been proposed in which the boss protein functions as a receptor, based on 
a (superficial) similarity to the G protein-coupled family of membrane 
receptors [2]. 

The boss gene encodes a protein of 896 amino acids with a putative 
N-terminal signal sequence, a large N-terminal extra-cellular domain, seven
transmembrane (TM) segments and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail [1,3]. The
boss protein from Drosophila virilis shares a high level of amino acid
identity with the D.melanogaster homologue, with highest levels of
similarity in the TM domains [3]. 

BRIDEOF7LESS is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
boss family of proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the putative TM
regions within the C-terminal half of the alignment. A single iteration
on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set.
