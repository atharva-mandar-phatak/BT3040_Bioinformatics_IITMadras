YTRCYTRDABC
The genome of Bacillus subtilis, a well-characterised Gram-positive
bacterium, encodes 4,100 protein-coding genes [1].Within the genome, 
six ytr genes form a single operon, ytrABCDEF, which may play a role in
acetoin utilisation during stationary phase and sporulation, and is believed
to encode a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system [2].It has
been suggested that YtrC and YtrD, which are highly hydrophobic proteins,
may form a channel through the cell membrane: YtrC is predicted to contain
9 TM segments and YtrD only 8 [2].

YTRCYTRDABC is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
YtrC/YtrC probable ABC transporter permeases. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 2,
3 and 5 span predicted transmembrane regions. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 
8 sequences was identified.
