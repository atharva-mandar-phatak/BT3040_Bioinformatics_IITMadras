RHESUSRHD
The RH (rhesus) blood group system is important in clinical medicine by
virtue of being involved in haemolytic disease of the newborn, transfusion
reactions, autoimmune haemolytic anaemias, and haemolytic reactions of 
nonimmune origin [1]. The RH locus from RhD-positive donors contains 2
homologous structural genes, one of which encodes the D protein that
carries the major antigen of the RH system. Hydropathy analysis of the 
RhD gene product reveals 13 hydrophobic domains, all of which have been 
assumed to be transmembrane (TM) [1]. 

RHESUSRHD is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
RhD proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn largely from the hydrophobic segments
suggested by le van Kim et al. to be membrane-spanning - they do not 
correspond precisely with those identified in [1], because the alignment
seemed to render 13 TM domains implausible (hydropathy analysis alone is
unlikely to be a reliable predictor of membrane-spanning motifs). A single
iteration on OWL22.1 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Three partial matches
were also found, one lacking the last 2 motifs and two lacking the last 7.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
