MEALWORMBTLB
The B proteins secreted by the tubular accessory sex glands of the male
mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, share sequence similarity with Drosophila
CS-5 proteins. On the basis of sequence analysis studies, it has been
suggested that the Drosophila proteins are related to abundant antennal
proteins previously identified in moths, the pheromone-binding protein
(PBP) family [1,2]. Together, these sequences are believed to represent
a class of carrier proteins that, like the lipocalins, may have broad
significance in a number of different tissues [2]. Sequence similarity
within the superfamily is very low.

MEALWORMBTLB is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
subfamily of mealworm beetle B proteins and Drosophila CS-5 proteins. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length. A single iteration on OWL27.1 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
