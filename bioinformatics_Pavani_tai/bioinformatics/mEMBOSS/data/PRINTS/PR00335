KUPTAKETRKA
The NAD(+)-binding protein TrkA is a component of a low-affinity K+
uptake system in E.coli [1]. Sequence analysis reveals that the protein
consists of 2 tandemly arrayed halves that are 22% identical, a situation 
that might have arisen through gene duplication. TrkA also exhibits
similarity to other E.coli proteins [2], in particular KefC, a glutathione-
regulated efflux protein [3], and to various dehydrogenase proteins that
possess NAD+ binding sites.

KUPTAKETRKA is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for TrkA
and related proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs correspond to conserved regions spanning an 
80-residue domain, which includes the predicted N-terminal NAD+/NADH
binding site (motif 1). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found (DHL2_LACCO and A49337),
both of which are dehydrogenases possessing NAD+/NADH binding sites. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
