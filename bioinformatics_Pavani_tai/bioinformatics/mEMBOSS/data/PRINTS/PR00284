TOXIN
A variety of peptide scorpion toxins have been identified that exert
their effect by binding to sodium or potassium channels, inhbiting
inactivation of activated channels and hence blocking neuronal 
transmission [1,2]. Another class of toxin includes plant proteins that
are toxic to animal cells [3]. Again, their effect is exerted at the level
of the cell membrane, although the precise mechanism is unknown. Comparison
of the primary and tertiary structures of toxins from different sources
shows a degree of similarity - this suggests that fine tuning of the
mode of action of the toxins is both tissue-specific and related to local
variations in the primary and tertiary structures.

The toxin structure is based on a 3-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, a
short length of alpha helix running parallel to the sheet, and several
beta-turns [4,5]. A number of disulphide bridges, some of which are
closely association with the helix and the sheet, provide a rigid core.
Overall, the shape of the molecule resembles a right-hand fist.

TOXIN is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for this super-
family of toxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs encode 4 conserved Cys resides, 2 towards the
N-terminus and 2 towards the C-terminus. Three iterations on OWL23.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
49 sequences was identified.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 48 sequences.
