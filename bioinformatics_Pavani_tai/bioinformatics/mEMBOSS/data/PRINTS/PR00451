CHITINBINDNG
A number of plant and fungal proteins that bind N-acetylglucosamine (e.g.,
non-leguminous plant lectins; plant endochitinases; wound-induced proteins,
hevein and win1/win2; and K.lactis killer toxin alpha subunit) contain a
conserved domain of around 43 amino acids [1]. The domain, which may occur
singly or multiply, is thought to be involved in recognition or binding of
chitin subunits: wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) contains a 4-fold repetition
of the domain; most chitinases contain a single copy, but that from the
nettle Urtica has 2 copies [2]. In chitinases and potato wound-induced
proteins, the chitin-binding domain is located N-terminally, while in the
killer toxin alpha subunit it lies centrally [3].

The sequence of the domain contains 8 conserved cysteine residues, all
of which are involved in disulphide bond formation in WGA. The topology
of the disulphides is summarised schematically below:

CHITINBINDNG is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
chitin-binding domain of plant and fungal proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs span the well-
conserved central portion of the domain, as shown above, which contains 5
of the 8 conserved cysteines, and includes the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern CHITIN_BINDING (PS00026). Three iterations on OWL26.3 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 71 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found: MZECHITC contains an
insertion, so fails to make a signficant match with motif 3; and CHIT_DIOJA
is a fragment that fails to match the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 75 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
