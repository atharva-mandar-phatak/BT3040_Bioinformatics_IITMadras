TNFACTORR11A
The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more
than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on
similarity in their extracellular domain - a region that contains many
cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [1]. The
cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for
ligand binding [2].

Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are
assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their
intracellular domains and sequences [3]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore
induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation,
differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the
receptor involved [4,5].

TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial
biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and
adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [3]. Drugs that
manipulate their signalling have potential roles in the prevention and
treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart
disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [6].

TNF receptors 11A and 11B mediate the effects of receptor activator for
NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL), an essential osteoclast regulatory factor. The
receptors have opposing effects - activation of TNF receptor 11A by RANKL
promotes osteoclast differentiation [7], while TNF receptor 11B acts as a
soluble decoy receptor for the ligand, thus inhibiting differentiation [8].

Mutations in the TNF receptor 11A gene have been implicated in a range of 
bone disorders, such as expansile osteolysis, osteopetrosis, and Paget 
disease of bone. The receptor also has a role in immune function, vascular 
disease and mammary gland development [9].

TNFACTORR11A is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
tumour necrosis factor receptor 11A. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those 
sections that characterise TNF receptor 11A but distinguish it from other 
TNF receptor subtypes - motif 1 resides within the extracellular N-terminal
region; motif 2 lies partially within the extracellular N-terminal region
and partially within the transmembrane domain; and motifs 3 and 4 reside
within the intracellular C-terminal region. A single iteration on SPTR57_40f
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified 
beyond the starting set.
