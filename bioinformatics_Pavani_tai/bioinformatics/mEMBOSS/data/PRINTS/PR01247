RECEXONCLASE
REC1 of Ustilago maydis plays a key role in regulating the genetic system
of the fungus. REC1 mutants are very sensitive to UV light - mutation
leads to a complex phenotype with alterations in DNA repair, recombination,
mutagenesis, meiosis and cell division [1]. The predicted product of the
REC1 gene is a polypeptide of 522 amino acid residues with molecular mass 
57 kDa. The protein shows 3'-->5' exonuclease activity, but only in cells
over-expressing REC1 [1]. While it is distinguishable from the major
bacterial nucleases, the protein has certain enzymatic features in common
with epsilon, the proof-reading exonuclease subunit of E.coli DNA polymerase
III holoenzyme [1].

RECEXONCLASE is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Rec1 exonuclease. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise the
Rec1 protein but distinguish it from members of the related Rad1 family. A
single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
