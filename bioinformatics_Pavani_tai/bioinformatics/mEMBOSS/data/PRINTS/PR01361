MEROZOITESA
A novel antigen of Plasmodium falciparum has been cloned that contains a
hydrophobic domain typical of an integral membrane protein [1]. The antigen
is designated apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) by virtue of appearing to 
be located in the apical complex [1]. AMA-1 appears to be transported to 
the merozoite surface close to the time of schizont rupture [1]. 

The 66kDa merozoite surface antigen (PK66) of Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian
malaria, possesses vaccine-related properties believed to originate from a 
receptor-like role in parasite invasion of erythrocytes [2]. The sequence
of PK66 is conserved throughout Plasmodium, and shows high similarity to
P.falciparum AMA-1. Following schizont rupture, the distribution of PK66 
changes in a coordinate manner associated with merozoite invasion [2]. Prior
to rupture, the protein is concentrated at the apical end, following which
it distributes itself entirely across the surface of the free merozoite [2].
Immunofluorescence studies suggest that, during invasion, PK66 is excluded
from the erythrocyte at, and behind, the invasion interface [2]. 

MEROZOITESA is a 15-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
apical membrane antigen 1 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, spanning the N- and
C-terminal flanks of the putative TM domain - motifs 1-13 lie in the
putative extracellular domain; and motifs 14 and 15 reside in the putative
cytoplasmic domain. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, O15681, an apical
membrane antigen 1 homologue from Toxoplasma gondii that matches 4 motifs.
