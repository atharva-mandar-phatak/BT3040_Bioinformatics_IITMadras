INSP3RECEPTR
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is an intracellular second messenger 
that transduces growth factor and neurotransmitter signals. InsP3 mediates 
the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by binding to specific Ca2+ 
channel-coupled receptors. One such receptor contains a C-terminal Ca2+ 
channel with 8 possible transmembrane (TM) regions, while its N-terminal 
cytoplasmic region houses ligand-binding and modulatory sites [1,2]. Ca2+
appears to inhibit ligand binding, possibly by interacting with a Ca2+-
binding protein that itself inhibits the receptor.

The InsP3 receptor is an integral membrane protein located in the
endoplasmic reticulum. It is a homotetramer. The protein shows some
similarity to the ryanodine receptor, which functions as a Ca2+-release
channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle [3].

INSP3RECEPTR is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
InsP3 receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 11 sequences - the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
the N-terminal third of the alignment. A single iteration on OWL29.4 was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found, S27272 and
MVRYR3, both of which are ryanodine receptors that match motifs 3 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences.
