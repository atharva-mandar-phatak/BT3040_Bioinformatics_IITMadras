CUCUMOCOAT
Cucumoviruses are tripartite RNA plant viruses believed to share a close
evolutionary relationship with brome mosaic viruses. The cucumoviruses
include cucumber mosaic [2], peanut stunt [3] and tomato aspermy
viruses [4]. The viral coat proteins show a high degree of sequence
similarity [2].

CUCUMOCOAT is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
coat protein of cucumoviruses. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations of OWL23.2 were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
22 sequences was identified.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 51 sequences.
