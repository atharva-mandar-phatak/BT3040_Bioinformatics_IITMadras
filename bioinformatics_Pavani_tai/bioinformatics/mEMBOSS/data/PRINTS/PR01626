LCACHANNELB
Calcium channels are generally discriminated by their biophysical and/or
pharmacological sensitivity. L-type calcium channels are distinguished by
their modulation by compounds such as dihydropyridines. These channels
tend to be localised mainly around the neuronal cell body, where they
influence calcium-dependent modulation and excitation-transcription coupling,
but are also found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, where they play a role in
excitation-contraction coupling and action potential shaping, respectively.

L-type calcium channnels are formed from different alpha-1 subunit isoforms
that determine the pharmacological properties of the channel, since they
form the drug binding domain. Other properties, such as gating voltage-
dependence, G protein modulation and kinase susceptibility, are influenced 
by alpha-2, delta and beta subunits [1].

Co-expression of beta subunit mRNA with alpha-1 subunit mRNA in xenopus
oocytes produces increased calcium currents, which are accompanied by a
shift in the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative membrane
potentials. Conversely, microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides to 
beta subunit mRNA produces decreased calcium currents and shifts voltage-
dependent activation to more positive membrane potentials. There are
four distinct beta subunits: beta-1, beta-2, beta-3 and beta-4; and the
magnitude of these effects varies with the particular subtype [2].

LCACHANNELB is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
L-type calcium channel beta subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 16 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the central portion of the alignment. Two iterations on
SPTR40_18f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 34 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also
found, Q9QVV4, a beta-2 subunit that appears to be truncated at the
N-terminal end.
