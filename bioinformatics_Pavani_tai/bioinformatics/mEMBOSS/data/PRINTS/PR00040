HTHMERR
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family groups together a range of proteins, including
the mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein merR, Bradyrhizobium
nodulation protein nolA and E.coli soxR protein [1-3]. Within this family,
the HTH motif is situated towards the N-terminus.

HTHMERR is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of the merR bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the first 2 motifs
completely encompass the HTH motif (cf. PROSITE pattern HTH_MERR (PS00552)),
and the third encodes a conserved region immediately beyond its C-terminus.
Two iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 17 sequences was identified. A single partial
match was also found, namely regulatory protein glnR from Bacillus subtilis.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 40 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
