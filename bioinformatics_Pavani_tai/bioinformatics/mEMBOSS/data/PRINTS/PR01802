SYNEMBRYN
Heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of alpha, beta and gamma subunits,
transduce signals from seven transmembrane (7TM) helix receptors to various
downstream effector systems. They are involved in the regulation of a wide
range of intracellular pathways and functions. Normally, ligand binding to
the receptor causes it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF),
binding the inactive GDP-bound G protein complex, and stimulating the release
of GDP from the G-alpha subunit. This facilitates dissociation of G-alpha-GTP
from the G-beta-gamma dimer, and thus from the recptor. The dissociated
G protein subunits then interact with their various effectors [1].

Synembryn is a novel non-receptor protein that acts as a potent GEF for
several G-alpha subunits. It is found in species as diverse as mammals and
the nematode C.elegans, where it was first discovered [2]. The role of
synembryn appears to be conserved across species, in that it is always
involved in regulating neurotransmitter transmission. The mechanism of
synembryn-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange is quite different from that
of the 7TM receptors. Synembryn binds to GDP-bound G-alpha in the absence of
the G-beta-gamma dimer, forming a stable, nucleotide-free G-alpha-synembryn
complex. To disrupt the complex, GTP-binding is required, releasing
synembryn and the activated G-alpha protein [2].

SYNEMBRYN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
synembryn family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in the C-terminal
portion of the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, Q9H9E7 from human and
Q9W356 from Drosophila, both of which have shorter C-termini.
