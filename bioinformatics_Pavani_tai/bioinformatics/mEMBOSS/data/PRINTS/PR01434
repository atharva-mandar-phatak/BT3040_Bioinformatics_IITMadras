NADHDHGNASE5
Mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) is an integral inner 
membrane protein. The protein is part of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(complex I), which catalyses the transfer of two electrons from NADH to 
ubiquinone in a reaction that is associated with proton translocation 
across the membrane [1]:
            NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol
In chloroplasts, this reaction is:
		NADH + plastoquinone = NAD(+) + plastoquinol. 

Defects in the ND5 gene are one of the causes of Leber's hereditary optic
neuropathy, a maternally inherited disease resulting in acute bilateral 
blindness due to retinal degeneration, predominantly in young men [2,3].
Cardiac conduction defects and neurological defects have also been described,
resulting in optic nerve degeneration and cardiac dysrhythmia [4]. The
clinical manifestations of this disease are thought to be the product of an
overall decrease in mitochondrial energy production, rather than the result
of a defect in a specific mitochondrial enzyme [3]. 

NADHDHGNASE5 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for NADH-
ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 5. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 73 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the central portion of the alignment. Three iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 212 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are family members that fail to make significant matches
with one or more motifs.
