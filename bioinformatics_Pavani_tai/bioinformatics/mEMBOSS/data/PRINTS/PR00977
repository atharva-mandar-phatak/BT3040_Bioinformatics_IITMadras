SCYTLDPTASE
Aspartic proteases have a catalytic aspartate residue at their active site.
A number of families (denoted by the letter A followed by a number) have 
been identified, most of which (including pepsin, retropepsin and 
cauliflower mosaic virus peptidase) have been grouped into a single clan 
(AA), as they are all thought to share a common ancestry. Families A6 and
A21 belong to the AB clan. The remaining families have not yet received 
clan assignments [1-3]. 

Scytalidopepsin B is a fungal aspartic protease belonging to the A4 family
[1,4]. This family of proteases has not yet been assigned to a clan. The
proteins are thermostable, pepstatin insensitive and are active at low pH 
ranges [1]. The enzyme has a unique heterodimeric structure, with a
39-residue light chain and a 173-residue heavy chain bound to each other
non-covalently [5]. 

SCYTLDPTASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
scytalidopepsin B aspartic protease (A4) family. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn 
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full length of the heavy
chain. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence
at which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
