AQUAPORIN10M
Aquaporins form water-specific channels that provide the plasma membranes 
of red cells and kidney proximal tubules with high permeability to water,
thereby permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient.
Aquaporin amino acid sequences contain two tandem repeats, each containing
three transmembrane (TM) domains and a pore-forming loop, with the signature
motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).

Aquaporin-10 forms a water channel [1]; it is not permeable to urea and
glycerol. It may contribute to water transport in the upper portion of small
intestine. The family is expressed exclusively in duodenum and jejunum. The
highest expression in absorptive epithelial cells is at the tips of villi
within the jejunum [2].

AQUAPORIN10M is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
mammalian aquaporin-10. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those sections
that characterise mammalian aquaporin-10 but distinguishes it from closely
related members of the aquaporin family - motif 1 lies in the third TM 
domain; motif 2 lies in the extracellular region between TM domains 3 and 4;
motif 3 resides in the fourth TM domain; motif 4 lies in the middle of the
sixth TM domain; and motif 5 resides in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region.
Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 3 sequences was identified.
