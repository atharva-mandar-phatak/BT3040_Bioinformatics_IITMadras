DKSAZNFINGER
The dksA gene product suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth and
filamentation of a dnaK deletion mutant of E.coli [1]. Gene knockout [1]
and deletion [2] experiments have shown the gene to be non-essential,
mutations causing a mild sensitivity to UV light, but not affecting DNA
recombination [2]. The protein contains a C-terminal region thought to fold
into a 4-cysteine zinc finger. Other proteins found to contain a similar
domain include the traR gene product, present on the conjugative plasmid
F [3], and several hypothetical proteins from bacteria and bacteriophages.

DKSAZNFINGER is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
dksA/traR zinc finger. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the full finger domain, spanning
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern DKSA_TRAR_ZN_FINGER (PS01102). Two
iterations on OWL28.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences.
