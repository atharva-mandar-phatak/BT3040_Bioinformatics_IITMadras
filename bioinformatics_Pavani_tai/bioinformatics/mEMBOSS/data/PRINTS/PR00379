INTEIN
Inteins, or protein introns, are parts of protein sequences that are
post-translationally excised, their flanking regions (exteins) being
spliced together to yield an additional protein product [1,2]. This
process is believed to be self-catalysed, apparently initiating at
the C-terminal splice junction, where a conserved asparagine residue
mediates the nucleophilic attack of the peptide bond between it and its
neighbouring residue.

Inteins are difficult to identify from sequence data because they lie in
the same reading frame as the spliced protein and they are characterised
by only a few short conserved motifs [1]: two of these are similar to
the nonapeptide LAGLIDADG, which is diagnostic of certain homing
endonucleases (mutation of one such motif causes loss of endonucleic
activity, but not of the protein splicing function); another includes the
C' splice site, mutations in which disable protein function.

INTEIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for inteins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions within the central portion
of the alignment (after Pietrokovski [1]) - motifs 2 and 3 include the nona-
peptide characteristic of endonucleic acitivity; motif 6 includes the C'
splice site containing the nucleophilic asparagine, and corresponds to
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern PROTEIN_SPLICING (PS00881). Two
iterations on OWL26.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. A single partial match was
also found, the yeast HO endonuclease, which fails to make significant
matches with motifs 4 and 6 (note, although the fingerprint makes only a
single identification of entries DPOL_THELI and PYWKODPOL, each in fact
contains 2 independent protein sequences).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 18
partial matches.
