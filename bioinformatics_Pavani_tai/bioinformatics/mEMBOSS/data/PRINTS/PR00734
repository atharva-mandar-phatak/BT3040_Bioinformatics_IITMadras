GLHYDRLASE7
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt).

Family 7 includes exoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases [5], which play a 
role in the conversion of cellulose to glucose by cutting the dissaccharide
cellobiose from the nonreducing end of the cellulose polymer chain. 
Structurally, cellulases and xylanases generally consist of a catalytic
domain joined to a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) via a linker region that
is rich in proline and/or hydroxy-amino acids. In type I exoglucanases, the
CBD domain is found at the C-terminal extremity of these enzyme (this short
domain forms a hairpin loop structure stabilised by 2 disulphide bridges).

GLHYDRLASE7 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
family 7 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
within the catalytic domain, prior to the linker region and C-terminal
cellulose-binding domain. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 24 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
cellobiohydrolase fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences.
