GERMIN
Synthesis of germin, a rare glycoprotein, signals the onset of growth in
germinating wheat embryos [1]. Germins are homopentameric proteins that
may play a role in altering the properties of cell walls during germinative
growth [2]. Spherulins 1a and 1b, which are similar to germins, are
specifically produced in slime molds during encystment (commonly known as 
spherulation) [3]. It has been suggested that these proteins may be
involved in cell-wall responses to dessication, hydration and osmotic
stress [2].

GERMIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
germins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motif 1 including most of the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern GERMIN (PS00725), which contains a well-conserved deca-
peptide. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 43 sequences.
