DAPIT
Streptozotocin (STZ) is an analogue of glucose that destroys the pancreatic
beta-cells, resulting in marked insulin deficiency and consequently altered
glucose metabolism and a diabetic-like state. For this reason STZ-induced
diabetes is the standard experimental model for diabetic research in
animals. The major tissues where glucose metabolism is regulated by insulin
are skeletal muscle and adipose.

Expression analysis experiments in rats exhibiting STZ-induced diabetes
identified a novel gene with down-regulated expression in skeletal muscle.
The transcript contained an open reading frame for a 58-residue putative
protein, designated Diabetes-Associated Protein in Insulin-sensitive Tissues
(DAPIT). DAPIT was found to be expressed in all tissues subjected to 
Northern blot analysis, highest levels being found in skeletal and cardiac
muscle, both of which are insulin sensitive. DAPIT contains a sequence of
hydrophobic amino acids from residues 27-46 that is predicted to contain a
possible transmembrane region [1]. Other members of the family have been
found to be up-regulated in response to active stretch of skeletal muscle.

DAPIT is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for DAPIT-like
proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set.
