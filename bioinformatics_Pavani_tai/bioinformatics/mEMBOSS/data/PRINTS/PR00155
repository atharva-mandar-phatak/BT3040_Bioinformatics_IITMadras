AMICYANIN
Type I blue copper proteins are found in methylothropic bacteria, where
they appear to function as the electron acceptor to methylamine dehydro-
genase [1]. They bind a single copper atom and are characterised by an
intense electronic absorption band near 600nm [2]. Several subclasses of
the blue copper proteins, such as the azurins and plastocyanins, have been
identified. Based on their primary sequences and their unique metabolic
role, amicyanins are considered as a distinct subclass of cupredoxins,
although they appear to be closely related to the plant plastocyanins.

The structure of amicyanin is a beta-sandwich, built from 9 beta-strands.
The copper atom is located between 3 loops on one end of the molecule.
Two of these loops contribute the copper ligands. The other 3 ligands are 
located on the loop between strands 8 and 9. The structure departs from
the general cupredoxin fold in having a 21-residue N-terminal extension,
which forms an extra beta-strand, and it shows significant differences
between strands 5 and 7 (this forms a helix in azurin and an acidic
patch in plastocyanin).  

AMICYANIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
amicyanins and pseudoazurins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 5 including the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern COPPER_BLUE (PS00196), which contains conserved
Cys and His residues involved in copper binding. Two iterations on OWL25.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
12 sequences was identified. Thirteen partial matches were also found,
virtually all of which are closely related plastocyanins.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
