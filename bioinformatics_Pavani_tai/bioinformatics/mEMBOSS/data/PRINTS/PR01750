AP2BTNSCPFCT
Activator protein-2 (AP-2) transcription factors constitute a family of
closely related and evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind to the DNA 
consensus sequence GCCNNNGGC and stimulate target gene transcription [1,2].
Four different isoforms of AP-2 have been identifed in mammals, termed AP-2
alpha, beta, gamma and delta. Each family member shares a common structure, 
possessing a proline/glutamine-rich domain in the N-terminal region, which 
is responsible for transcriptional activation [1], and a helix-span-helix
domain in the C-terminal region, which mediates dimerisation and site-
specific DNA binding [2].

The AP-2 family have been shown to be critical regulators of gene expression
during embryogenesis. They regulate the development of facial prominence and
limb buds, and are essential for cranial closure and development of the lens
[3]; they have also been implicated in tumorigenesis. AP-2 protein 
expression levels have been found to affect cell transformation, tumour 
growth and metastasis, and may predict survival in some types of cancer [4,5].

AP-2 beta was originally isolated by cDNA screening of a human genomic 
library [6]. The protein was designated AP-2 beta on the basis of its high 
sequence similarity to AP-2 alpha, its site-specific DNA binding, and its
ability to stimulate transcription [6]. Defects in AP-2 beta have been shown
to cause Char syndrome, an autosomal dominant trait characterised by patent
ductus arteriosus, facial dysmorphism and hand anomalies [7].

AP2BTNSCPFCT is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
transcription factor AP-2 beta proteins. The fingerprint was derived from 
an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions in the N-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those sections 
that characterise AP-2 beta but distinguish it from other family members -
motif 1 resides within the transcriptional activation domain; and motifs 2-4
lie between the transcriptional activation domain and the dimerisation
domain. A single iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
