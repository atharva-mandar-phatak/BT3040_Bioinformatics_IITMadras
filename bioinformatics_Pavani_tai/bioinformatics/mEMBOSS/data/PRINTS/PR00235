HSVCAPSIDMCP
The Herpesvirus major capsid protein (MCP) is the principal protein of the
icosahedral capsid, forming the main component of the hexavalent and
probably the pentavalent capsomeres. It shares similarity with all other
Herpesvirus major capsid proteins.

HSVCAPSIDMCP is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Herpesvirus major capsid proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL21.1
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences.
