THYMDSNTHASE
Thymidylate synthase catalyses the conversion of deoxypuridine monophosphate
(dUMP) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to oxythymidine monophosphate
(dTMP) and dihydrofolate. This provides the sole de novo pathway for 
production of dTMP and is the only enzyme in folate metabolism in which the
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate is oxidised during one-carbon transfer [1].
The enzyme is essential for regulating the balanced supply of the 4 DNA
precursors in normal DNA replication: defects in the enzyme activity
affecting the regulation process cause various biological and genetic
abnormalities, such as thymineless death [2]. The enzyme exists as a homo-
dimer, and is also found as a bifunctional enzyme in protozoa, containing
dihydrofolate reductase activity [1].

THYMDSNTHASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
thymidylate synthases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs surround the active site, motif 4
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern THYMIDYLATE_SYNTHASE
(PS00091), which contains the catalytically important Cys residue. Two
iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 30 sequences was identified. A single partial match
was also found, TYSY_LACLA, a thymidylate synthase fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 47 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
