ANNEXINX
The annexins (or lipocortins) are a family of proteins that bind to
phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner [1]. They are distributed
ubiquitously in different tissues and cell types of higher and lower
eukaryotes, including mammals, fish, birds, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus
laevis, Caenorhabtidis elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum and Neurospora 
crassa [2,3]. The plant annexins are somewhat distinct from those found in
other taxa [3].

Several distinct annexin subtypes exist, each of which has an amino acid
sequence consisting of an N-terminal 'arm' followed by 4 or 8 copies of a
conserved domain of 61 residues (only one of these residues, an arginine,
is conserved between all copies). The calcium binding sites are found within
the repeated domains [4]. Individual repeats (sometimes referred to as 
endonexin folds) consist of 5 alpha-helices wound into a right-handed
superhelix. The biological roles of some annexin subtypes is unclear; the
family has been linked with inhibition of phospholipase activity,
exocytosis and endoctyosis, signal transduction, organisation of the
extracellular matrix, resistance to reactive oxygen species and DNA
replication [2].

Human annexin A10 (annexin 14) was first identified in silico by searches of
dbEST with a number of divergent annexins [5]. The analysis revealed single
human and mouse ESTs corresponding to a novel and rarely expressed annexin
in which three of the four tetrad core repeats lack the calcium-binding 
domain. It was proposed that this subtype, together with A5 annexin, gave
rise to the type VI octad through a process of gene duplication and fusion 
in early chordate evolution [5].

ANNEXINX is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
type A10 annexins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full 
alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise type A10 
annexins but distinguish them from other closely related annexin subtypes -
motif 1 lies at the N-terminus; motif 2 resides between repeats 1 and 2; 
and motif 3 lies in the C-terminal region beyond the fourth repeat. Two 
iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 3 sequences was identified. A single partial match
was also found, Q9D7W0, a mouse annexin A10 that lacks part of the 
N-terminus and therefore fails to match the first motif.
