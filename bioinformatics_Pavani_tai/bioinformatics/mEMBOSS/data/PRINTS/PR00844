GLHYDRLASE48
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 48 encompasses endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) and 
cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91).

The largest cellulase gene sequenced to date is one of the cellulases (celA)
from the genome of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Caldocellum 
saccharolyticum [5]. The celA gene product is a polypeptide of 1751 amino
acids; this has a multidomain structure comprising two catalytic domains 
and two cellulose-binding domains, linked by Pro-Thr-rich regions (so-called
PT linkers) [5]. The N-terminal domain encodes an endoglucanase activity on
carboxymethylcellulose, consistent with its similarity to several endo-1, 
4-beta-D-glucanase sequences. The C-terminal domain shows similarity to a 
cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum (CelS), which acts synergistically
with a second component to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose [5]. 

GLHYDRLASE48 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 48 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal portion of the alignment, which corresponds to the
second catalytic domain, downstream from the Pro-Thr-rich region in celA 
from C.saccharolyticum. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 1
partial match.
