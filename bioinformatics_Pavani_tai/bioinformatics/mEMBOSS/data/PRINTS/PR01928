INTRLEUKN12B
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12, also known as natural killer cell stimulatory 
factor and cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor) is a 75 kDa heterodimer
composed of two genetically unrelated subunits - an alpha chain (p35 
subunit) and a beta chain (p40 subunit). Production of the cytokine plays 
an important role in the generation of cell-mediated immunity against many
infectious pathogens [1]. The IL-12 beta chain also associates with 
IL-23 alpha to form IL-23 [2], a proinflammatory cytokine that is 
over-expressed in and around tumour tissues, where it induces local
inflammation and promotes tumour development [3].

INTRLEUKN12B is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
interleukin-12 beta subunit. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal two thirds of the alignment - motifs 1 and 2
encompass short regions of beta strand, and motif 3 spans a beta turn. Two
iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 43 sequences was identified.
