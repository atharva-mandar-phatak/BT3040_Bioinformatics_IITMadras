HIVVPRVPX
HIV is the human retrovirus associated with AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome), and SIV its simian counterpart. Three main groups
of primate lentivirus are known, designated HIV-1, HIV-2/SIVMAC/SIVSM and
SIVAGM. More recently, SIVMND has been suggested to represent a fourth 
distinct group [1]. These groups are believed to have diverged from a
common ancestor long before the spread of AIDS in humans.

Genetic variation in HIV-1 and HIV-2 has been studied extensively, and
the nucleotide sequences reported for several strains [2]. ORF analysis
has revealed 2 open reading frames, yielding the so-called R- and X-ORF
proteins, whose functions are unknown, but which show a high degree of
sequence similarity. 

HIVVPRVPX is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
HIV R-ORF and X-ORF proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Three iterations on OWL26.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
107 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 266 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
