EUTPISMRASEI
Eukaryotic topoisomerase I, otherwise known as relaxing enzyme, untwisting 
enzyme or swivelase, catalyses the ATP-independent breakage of single-
stranded DNA, followed by passage and rejoining of another single-stranded 
DNA region [1]. This reaction brings about the conversion of one topological
DNA isomer into another: e.g., relaxation of positive and negative super-
coils; interconversion of simple and knotted rings of single-stranded DNA;
and intertwisting of single-stranded rings of complementary sequences [1,2].

A tyrosine residue at the active site is involved in the transient breakage
of a DNA strand and formation of a covalent protein-DNA intermediate [1].
Human topoisomerase I has been shown to be inhibited by camptothecin (CPT),
a plant alkaloid with antitumour activity [2].

EUTPISMRASEI is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
eukaryotic topoisomerase I. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
throughout the alignment length - motif 6 contains part of the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern TOPOISOMERASE_I_EUK (PS00176), the tyrosine
residue of which is involved in creating the covalent protein-DNA
intermediate. Two iterations on OWL26.3 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 16 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 28 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
