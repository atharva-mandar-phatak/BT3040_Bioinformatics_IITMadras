SPERACTRCPTR
The egg peptide speract receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein of about
500 amino acids [1]. Topologically, it comprises a large extracellular
domain of about 450 residues, followed by a transmembrane domain and a
short cytoplasmic region of about 12 amino acids. The extracellular
domain contains 4 repeats of a well-conserved region, which spans 115
amino acids and contains 6 conserved cysteines. A similar domain is also
found towards the C-terminus of macrophage scavenger receptor type I [2],
a membrane glycoprotein implicated in the pathologic deposition of
cholesterol in arterial walls during artherogenesis, and in the CD5
glycoprotein, which acts as a receptor in regulating T-cell proliferation.

SPERACTRCPTR is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
egg peptide speract receptor and related proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from a number of short regions within the conserved domain, motifs
1-3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE pattern SPERACT_RECEPTOR
(PS00420). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 17 sequences was identified. Partial
matches were also made with T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 precursors.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 28 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
