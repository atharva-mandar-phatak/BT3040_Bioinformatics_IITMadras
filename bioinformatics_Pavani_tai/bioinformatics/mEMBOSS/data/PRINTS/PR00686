TIFACTORIID
Transcription factor TFIID (also known as TATA-binding protein, TBP) is a
general factor that plays a central role in the activation of eukaryotic
genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II [1,2]. TFIID binds specifically to
the TATA-box promoter element, which lies close to the position of
transcription initiation.

The C-terminal domain (~180 residues) of eukaryotic TFIID sequences is
highly conserved and is involved in TATA-box binding. The most striking
feature of the domain is the presence of 2 conserved 77 amino-acid repeats.
The symmetrical disposition of these features generates a saddle-shaped
structure that straddles the DNA [3].

Drosophila TRF (TBP-related factor), a sequence-specific transcription
factor that also binds to the TATA-box, is highly similar to TFIID [4].

TIFACTORIID is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for TFIID
TATA sequence-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 16 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions essentially spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment, motifs 2
and 3 lying in the region encoded by PROSITE pattern TFIID (PS00351). Two
iterations on OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 40 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were
also found, all of which are TATA-binding proteins that fail to make a
significant match with motif 1. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 47 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
