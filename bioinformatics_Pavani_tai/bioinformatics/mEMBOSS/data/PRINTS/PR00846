GLHYDRLASE56
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 56 encompasses a group of hyaluronidases (EC 3.2.1.35)
that includes venom hyaluronidases [5] and mammalian sperm surface proteins
(PH-20) [6].

The venom of honeybees contains several biologically-active peptides and 
two enzymes, one of which is a hyaluronidase [5]. The amino acid sequence
of bee venom hyaluronidase contains 349 amino acids, and includes four
cysteines and a number of potential glycosylation sites [5]. The sequence
shows a high degree of similarity to PH-20, a membrane protein of mammalian 
sperm involved in sperm-egg adhesion, supporting the view that hyaluronidases
play a role in fertilisation [5]. 

PH-20 is required for sperm adhesion to the egg zona pellucida; it is
located on both the sperm plasma membrane and acrosomal membrane [6]. The
amino acid sequence of the mature protein contains 468 amino acids, and
includes six potential N-linked glycosylation sites and twelve cysteines,
eight of which are tightly clustered near the C-terminus [6].

GLHYDRLASE56 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 56 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL30.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
18 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 20 sequences.
