HAEMOXYGNASE
Haem oxygenase is an essential enzyme in haem catabolism, catalysing the 
oxidative cleavage of the haem ring at the alpha methene bridge, yielding
biliverdin and carbon monoxide [1]. This microsomal enzyme is induced by
its substrate haem, heavy metal atoms, and various other factors [1].
Mammals possess 2 oxygenase isozymes (HO1 and HO2), which show a high  
degree of sequence similarity [2]: unlike HO1, however, HO2 is not
inducible by haem and other factors [1,2]. It is believed that HO2 may
be active in the brain, producing carbon monoxide, which is said to act
as a neurotransmitter [2]. 

HAEMOXYGNASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for haem
oxygenases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motif 4 including the active centre region
encoded by PROSITE pattern HEME_OXYGENASE (PS00593), the His of which is
thought to bind the haem. Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
