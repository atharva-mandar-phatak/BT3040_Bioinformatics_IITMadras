OMS28PORIN
The outer membrane-spanning (Oms) proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi have been 
isolated and their porin activities characterised; 0.6-nS porin activity 
was found to reside in a 28kDa protein, designated Oms28 [1]. The gene
sequence of oms28 was found to encode a 257-amino-acid precursor protein 
with a putative 24-amino-acid leader peptidase I signal sequence [1]. The
Oms28 protein partly fractionated to the outer membrane, and was
characterised by an average single-channel conductance of 1.1 nS in a
planar lipid bilayer assay, confirming Oms28 to be a porin [1].

OMS28PORIN is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
Oms28 porin from the Lyme disease spirochete. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration 
on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
