PROTEASES2C
The E.coli htrA gene product (or DegP protein) is essential for bacterial
survival at temperatures above 42 degrees [1,2]. The htrA gene has been 
sequenced and an open reading frame coding for a protein of 491 amino acids
identified [1]. The protein has an N-terminal sequence typical of a leader
peptide. The HtrA protein has been shown to be a specific endopeptidase 
that is inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, suggesting that HtrA is
a serine protease [2]. 

The degQ and degS genes of E.coli encode proteins of 455 and 355 residues
that are homologues of the DegP protease [3]. Purified DegQ protein has the
properties of a serine endoprotease, and is processed by the removal of a
27-residue N-terminal signal sequence. Deletion studies suggest that DegQ,
like DegP, functions as a periplasmic protease in vivo [3].

PROTEASES2C is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
htrA/degQ family of serine proteases. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the central portion of the alignment - motif 1 includes
the catalytic histidine; motif 2 contains the catalytic Asp; and motif 4
includes the catalytic Ser. Three iterations on OWL30.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 40 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which appear
to be related proteases that fail to match one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 41 sequences, and 25
partial matches.
