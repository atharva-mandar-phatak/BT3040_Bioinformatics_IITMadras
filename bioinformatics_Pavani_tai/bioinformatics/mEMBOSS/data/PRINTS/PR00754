AEROLYSIN
Aerolysin is responsible for the pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila, a
bacterium associated with diarrhoeal diseases and deep wound infections [1].
In common with other microbial toxins, the protein changes in a multi-step
process from a water-soluble form to produce a transmembrane channel that
destroys sensitive cells by breaking their permeability barriers [1].

The structure of proaerolysin has been determined to 2.8A resolution and
shows the protoxin to adopt a novel fold [1]. Images of an aerolysin 
oligomer derived from electron microscopy have helped to construct a
model of the protein and to outline a mechanism by which it might insert
into lipid bilayers to form ion channels [1].

AEROLYSIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
aerolysins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 10
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL29.4 was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. A single partial match was found, CLOALPTOX, a related
alpha-toxin from Clostridium septicum that matches motifs 4 and 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
