GLHYDRLASE16
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt).

Family 16 mainly encompasses bacterial beta-glucanases. These enzymes
hydrolyse 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in beta-D-glucans containing
1,3- and 1,4-bonds.

The 3D structure of a hybrid endo-1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase
from Bacillus has been refined to 1.6A [5]. The protein belongs to the
mainly-beta class, with 16 strands and 3 helices; the fold reveals a
compact jellyroll-type beta-sheet structure that comprises two major
anti-parallel beta-sheets and a 3-stranded minor mixed sheet. Amino acid
residues involved in catalysis (two closely-clustered conserved glutamates
[6]) and substrate binding are located inside a deep channel spanning the
surface of the protein [5]. 

GLHYDRLASE16 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 16 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions 
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1 spans beta-strands
6 and 7; motif 2 includes strand 8; motif 3 spans strand 9 and includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F16 (PS01034), which
contains the catalytic cluster of acidic residues; motif 4 includes strand
10; motif 5 spans helix 2 and strand 12; motif 6 spans strands 13 and 14;
motif 7 spans strand 15 and helix 3; and motif 7 includes strand 16. Two
iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 25 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are related sequences that fail to make
significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences, and 11
partial matches.
