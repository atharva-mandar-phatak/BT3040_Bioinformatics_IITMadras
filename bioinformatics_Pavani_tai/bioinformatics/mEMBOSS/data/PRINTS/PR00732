GLHYDRLASE4
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 4 includes 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases, alpha-
galactosidases, and B.subtilis LPLD protein. 

GLHYDRLASE4 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
family 4 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions 
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. A single iteration on OWL29.3
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 1
partial match.
