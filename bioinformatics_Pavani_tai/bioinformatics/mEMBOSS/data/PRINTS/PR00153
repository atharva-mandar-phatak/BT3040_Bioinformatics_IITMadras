CSAPPISMRASE
In vertebrates, cyclophilin is the major high-affinity binding protein 
for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CSA) [1]. The protein
exhibits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase or rotamase) activity
- PPIase accelerates protein folding by catalysing the cis-trans
isomerisation of proline imide bonds in oligopeptides [2]. It is thought
that CSA may mediate some of its effects by inhibition of PPIase.
Cyclophilin is a cytosolic protein that belongs to a family of isozymes,
including cyclophilins B and C, PPIase, and natural killer cell
cyclophilin-related protein [3-5].

CSAPPISMRASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
cyclophilin and related proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length, motif 2 including the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern CSA_PPIASE (PS00154). Two iterations on 
OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 43 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were
also found, which are either fragments or sequences that fail to make
significant matches with one or more of the motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 129 sequences, and 20
partial matches.
