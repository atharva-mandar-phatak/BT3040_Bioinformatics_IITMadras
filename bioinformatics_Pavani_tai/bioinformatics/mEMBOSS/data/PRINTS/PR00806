VINCULIN
Vinculin is a eukaryotic protein that appears to be involved in the
attachment of actin-based microfilaments to the plasma membrane [1].  
It also interacts with other structural proteins, such as talin [2] and
alpha-actinin. The protein is located on the cytoplasmic side of focal
contacts or adhesion plaques.

Vinculin is a large protein (~1000 residues) that contains an acidic
N-terminal domain, separated from a smaller, basic C-terminal domain by a
50-residue proline-rich region [3]. The central part of the N-terminal
domain consists of a variable number of repeats of a 110-residue domain,
one of which is lacking in nematode vinculin [4]. Alpha-catenins are 
evolutionarily related to vinculin, but differ in terms of their structure
in lacking the repeated domain and proline-rich segment.

VINCULIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
vinculins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
C-terminal half of the alignment - motifs 1 and 2 lie in the proline-rich
region; and motifs 3-7 lie in the C-terminal domain. Two iterations on
OWL30.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 8 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found,
S87175S3 and VINC_XENLA, both of which are vinculin fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
