BCATNINFAMLY
The beta catenins and homologues, plakoglobin and the Drosophila Armadillo
protein [1], are implicated in cell adhesion and Wnt signalling [2].
Originally identified as downstream elements (armadillo phenotype) of
the Wnt signalling pathway (wingless phenotype) [3,4], these proteins have
also been shown to be components of adherens junctions, joining classical
cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in cell adhesion [5]. The beta-catenin
structure has been determined [6-7]. 

Beta catenin family proteins contain several ARM repeats, sequences of
approximately 50 amino acids involved in protein-protein interactions. Each
repeat consists of three helices [6-8], with helix 1 and 3 antiparallel to
each other and perpendicular to helix 2 [6-8]. A conserved glycine residue
allows the sharp turn between helices 1 and 2 [6-8]. 

BCATNINFAMLY is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
beta-catenin family of proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 lie in
the N-terminal acidic (Asp/Glu-rich) region; motifs 3-9 reside in the first,
third, fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth and twelfth ARM repeats respectively.
Three iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 24 sequences was identified.
