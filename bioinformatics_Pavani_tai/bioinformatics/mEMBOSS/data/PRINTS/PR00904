FRATAXIN
Friedreich ataxia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by
loss of function mutations in the gene encoding frataxin (FRDA). Frataxin
mRNA is predominantly expressed in tissues with a high metabolic rate 
(including liver, kidney, brown fat and heart). Mouse and yeast frataxin
homologues contain a potential N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
and human frataxin has been observed to co-localise with a mitochondrial
protein. Furthermore, disruption of the yeast gene has been shown to result
in mitochondrial dysfunction. Friedreich's ataxia is thus believed to be a
mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the nuclear genome
(specifically, expansion of an intronic GAA triplet repeat).

FRATAXIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for frataxin.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Two partial
matches were found: AF028240 is a human frataxin gene splice variant, and
CELF59G14 is a C.elegans sequence whose N-terminal domain shows high
similarity to motifs 6 and 7 (and lower similarity also to motifs 4 and 5) -
the C-terminal domain is a protein tyrosine phosphatase.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences, and 1
partial match.
