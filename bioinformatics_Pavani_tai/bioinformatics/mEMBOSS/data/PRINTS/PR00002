GLABONE
Bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (BGP) and matrix gamma- 
carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP) are the only vitamin K-dependent 
proteins that have been isolated from bone. MGP is a 79 residue protein 
found in bone, dentin and cartilage: it contains 5 gamma-carboxyglutamic 
acid (Gla) residues (formed by post-translational modification of glutamic 
acid by vitamin K-dependent carboxylase) and a single disulphide bond. 
BGP is a 49 residue protein found in bone: it contains 3 Gla residues and 
a single disulphide bond. There is little similarity between these vitamin 
K-dependent bone proteins and the blood coagulation proteins, though they 
are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor [1].

GLABONE is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
invariant Gla domain of bone protein. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 5 sequences (after Price et al. [1]): the motifs span
the full length of the Gla domain. Two iterations on OWL11.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 17 sequences
was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences.
