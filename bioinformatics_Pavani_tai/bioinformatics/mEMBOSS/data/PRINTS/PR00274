GLYCOHORMONE
The glycoprotein hormone family includes luteinising hormone (LH), follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and placental 
chorionic gonadotrophins hCG and eCG [1], all of which are central to the 
complex endocrine system that regulates normal growth, sexual development, 
and reproductive function [2]. The hormones LH, FSH and TSH are secreted
by the anterior pituitary gland, while hCG and eCG are secreted by the 
placenta [3]. 

The glycoprotein hormones are dimeric proteins, each containing a common
alpha subunit (well conserved within species, but differing between them
[2]), and a unique beta subunit, which confers biological specificity [1].
Intracellular levels of free alpha subunits are greater than those of the
mature glycoprotein, implying that hormone assembly is limited by the
appearance of the specific beta subunits, and hence that synthesis of alpha
and beta is independently regulated [1].

GLYCOHORMONE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the glycoprotein hormones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 4 including
regions encoded by PROSITE patterns GLYCO_HORMONE_ALPHA_1 (PS00779) and
GLYCO_HORMONE_ALPHA_2 (PS00780). Two iterations on OWL22.1 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 23 sequences
was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 34 sequences.
