RAGALLERGEN
Seeds of cereals contain a variety of serine proteases and alpha-amylase
inhibitors. These inhibitors can be grouped into families based on structural
similarities. Trypsin/alpha-amylase inhibitors are specific to trypsin or to
alpha-amylase, and a few are bifunctional. The proteins contain ~120 amino
acids, including 10 cysteine residues, all of which are involved in
disulphide bond formation [1], as represented schematically below:

The 3D structure of the bifunctional alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor (RBI)
from seeds of ragi (Eleusine coracana) has been determined in solution using
multidimensional 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy [2]. The inhibitor forms a 
globular 4-helix motif with a simple "up-and-down" topology, and includes
a short anti-parallel beta-sheet [2]. 

This family also includes various rice seed allergenic proteins (RA) [3,4].
Genomic and two novel cDNA clones for RA have been isolated and their
nucleotide sequences determined [3]. One genomic clone was found to contain
two RA genes, RAG1 and RAG2, which are arranged divergently [3]. Blotting
analyses showed that RA are encoded by a multigene family consisting of at
least four members. A conserved sequence similar to a motif identified in
rice glutelin promoters was observed in the 5' region of the two genes [3].
RA genes are specifically expressed in ripening seeds and their transcripts 
accumulate maximally 15-20 days after flowering [3]. 

RAGALLERGEN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the RAG family of rice seed allergenic proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from short conserved sections spanning the full alignment length, focusing
on those regions that characterise the RAG proteins but distinguish them
from the rest of the cereal trypsin/alpha-amylase inhibitor family - motif 1
lies in the leader sequence; and motifs 2 and 3 span the region encoded by 
PROSITE pattern CEREAL_TRYP_AMYL_INH (PS00426), which itself includes the
first 3 conserved Cys residues. A single iteration on OWL30.0 was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set. Several partial matches were found, all of which are either 
fragments or sequences lacking the characteristic signal peptide; IAA1_HORVU 
is a closely related sequence from the HOR allergen family that matches 
motifs 2, 3 and 8.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 1
partial match.
