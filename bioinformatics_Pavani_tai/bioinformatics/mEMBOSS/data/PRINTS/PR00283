MYOTOXIN
Myotoxins [1,2] are small basic peptides found in rattlesnake venom that 
cause severe muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. The peptides
act very rapidly, causing instantaneous paralysis of the limbs to limit
the flight of prey, and promoting death by paralysis of the diaphragm.
Myotoxins have a well-conserved structure containing 6 cysteine residues, 
which are involved in 3 disulphide bridges.

MYOTOXIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
myotoxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs span the full alignment length and include the
6 well-conserved Cys residues encoded by PROSITE pattern MYOTOXINS
(PS00459). Two iterations on OWL23.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also indentified, C39560, a myotoxin fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences.
