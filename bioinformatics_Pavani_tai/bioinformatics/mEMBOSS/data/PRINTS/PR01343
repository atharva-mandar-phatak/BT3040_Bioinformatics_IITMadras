YEASTERF
Elongation factors belong to a family of proteins that promote the GTP-
dependent binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the A site of ribosomes during
protein biosynthesis, and catalyse the translocation of the synthesised
protein chain from the A to the P site. The proteins are all relatively
similar in the vicinity of their C-termini, and are also highly similar
to a range of proteins that includes the nodulation Q protein from 
Rhizobium meliloti, bacterial tetracycline resistance proteins [1]
and yeast elongation factors.

Although the yeast elongation factors, or omnipotent suppressor proteins,
share a large degree of similarity with other eukaryotic elongation factors,
the chief difference is that they possess an N-terminal extension rich in 
repetitive, glutamine-rich elements, and a central charged unit.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERF2 expression has been shown to cause non-
mendelian (all progeny to the first and second generation exhibit the
phenotype) inheritance of nonsense suppression (stop-codon read-through),
mediated by the N-terminal and charged regions. This observation has led to
the hypothesis that the yeast elongation factors are 'yeast prions',
showing the same properties as those theorised to exist in mammalian
prions [2].

YEASTERF is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the yeast
eukaryotic release factors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: motif 1 was drawn from the central, charge-rich
region; and motifs 2-5 reside at the C-terminus. Three iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 5 sequences was identified.
