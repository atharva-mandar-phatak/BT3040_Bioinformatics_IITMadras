ACRYSTALLIN
The crystallins are water-soluble structural proteins that occur in
high concentration in the cytoplasm of eye lens fibre cells. Four major
groups of crystallin have been distinguished on the basis of size,
charge and immunological properties: alpha-, beta- and gamma-crystallins
occur in all vertebrate classes (though gamma-crystallins are low or
absent in avian lenses); and delta-crystallin is found exclusively in
reptiles and birds [1,2].

Alpha-crystallin occurs as large aggregates, comprising 2 types of related
subunits (A and B). These are highly similar to the small (15-30kDa) heat
shock proteins (HSPs), particularly in their C-terminal halves. The
relationship between these families is one of classic gene duplication
and divergence, from the small HSP family, allowing adaptation to novel
functions. Divergence probably occurred prior to evolution of the eye
lens, alpha-crystallin being found in small amounts in tissues outside
the lens [1].

ACRYSTALLIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
alpha crystallins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length, motifs 3-7 falling in the C-terminal domain encoded
by PROSITE profile HSP20 (PS01031). Two iterations on OWL25.2 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 51 sequences was
identified. Numerous partial matches were also found, i.e. the  related
family of heat shock proteins, all of which fail to match motifs 1 and 7. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 56 sequences, and 38
partial matches.
