ABHYDROLASE
The alpha/beta hydrolase fold is common to a number of hydrolytic enzymes
of widely differing phylogenetic origin and catalytic function. The core
of each enzyme is an alpha/beta-sheet (rather than a barrel), containing 8
strands connected by helices [1]. The enzymes are believed to have diverged
from a common ancestor, preserving the arrangement of the catalytic
residues. All have a catalytic triad, the elements of which are borne on
loops, which are the best conserved structural features of the fold. 

ABHYDROLASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
members of this diverse family of enzymes. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: motifs 2 and 4 include elements
of the catalytic triad. Three iterations on OWL17.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10 sequences was
identified: this included hydrolases, dehalogenases, lipases, and a
depolymerase. Several partial matches were also found, including magnesium
chelatase, chloroperoxidase, atropine acylhydrolase, haloacetate
dehalogenase, and so on, all of which are likely to be family members. The
low level of similarity between the different sequence types means that the
fingerprint has not performed well, and has missed sequences that are
probably family members (e.g. epoxide hydrolases). It does, however,
provide a rough diagnostic tool.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 29 sequences, and 44
partial matches.
