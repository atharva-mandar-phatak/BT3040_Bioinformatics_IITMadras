NAFLGMOTY
Energy to power the rotation of bacterial flagella can be derived from the
proton or sodium transmembrane potential [1]. The motY gene encoding a
component of the sodium-type flagellar motor of Vibrio parahaemolyticus has
been cloned, and a 33kDa product identified [1]. Unlike mot genes from
other bacteria, the locus was not an extended region with multiple motility 
genes [1]. 

To date, sequence analysis has failed to reveal significant similarity to
known motility components. Nevertheless, the MotY C-terminus is similar
to a number of outer membrane proteins known to interact with peptidoglycan,
including OmpA and peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins [1]. This suggests 
that MotY may play the role of a stator in the sodium flagellar motor, 
stabilising the force-generating unit through direct interaction with the 
cell wall [1]. 

NAFLGMOTY is a 13-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
sodium-type flagellar protein MotY. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 includes the putative
signal sequence; and motifs 10-12 span the OmpA-like domain. A single 
iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found, 
OMPA_BORAV and YIAD_ECOLI, both of which contain C-terminal OmpA-like
domains and hence match the C-terminal motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
