PSTLEXTENSIN
Extensins are plant cell-wall proteins; they can account for up to 20% of
the dry weight of the cell wall. They are highly-glycosylated, possibly
reflecting their interactions with cell-wall carbohydrates. Amongst their 
functions is cell wall strengthening in response to mechanical stress (e.g.,
during attack by pests, plant-bending in the wind, etc.).

By contrast with extensin genes, pistil-specific extensin-like genes are
not induced under stress conditions [1]. Gene expression is organ-specific 
and temporally regulated during pistil development. After pollination, 
transcript levels of pistil-specific extensin-like genes change relative to
levels in unpollinated pistils [1]. The protein sequence is characterised
by a number of ser-pro-pro-pro-pro pentapeptide repeats.

PSTLEXTENSIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
pistil-specific extensin-like proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were largely drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1
lies towards the N-terminus, while motifs 2-8 reside in the C-terminal
domain. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, 
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Two partial
matches were found, both of which are related proteins that fail to match
one or more motifs.
