CRCMSPRZOITE
The circumsporozoite (CS) protein is the most prominant surface antigen on
the sporozoite of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium spp. The sporozoite is
the infectious stage of the Plasmodium life cycle, the form in which malaria
is passed from the mosquito vector to the mammalian host [1]. Antibodies to
this protein are used in the field to detect exposure to malaria [2] and it 
is a target for several vaccines [3].

The sequence of the CS protein consists of head and tail regions, which are
largely conserved, and a large set of low-complexity repeats, which are 
variant across strain and species [4]. The C-terminal region is probably
used for anchoring the protein to the cell membrane, while the central
repeat sequences would be the surface antigen of the organism. The repeats,
which encode the immunodominant epitope of the CS protein, diverge more
rapidly than the remainder of the gene. It is thought that the maintenance
and evolution of the repeats is achieved via a mechanism that acts not at
the protein level but, rather, directly on the DNA sequence [4]. 

CRCMSPRZOITE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Plasmodium circumsporozoite proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the conserved
N- and C-terminal regions of the alignment, flanking the central repeats -
motif 1 spans the putative signal sequence. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 49
sequences was identified.
