LUTEOGP1COAT
Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) can be separated into two groups based 
on serological relationships, presumably governed by the viral capsid 
structure [1]. Coding regions of coat proteins have been identified for the
MAV-PS1, P-PAV (group 1) and NY-RPV (group 2) isolates of BYDV. Group 1 
proteins show 71% sequence similarity to each other, 51% similarity to those
of group 2, and a high degree of similarity to those from other luteoviruses
(including coat proteins from beet western yellow virus (BWYV) [2] and 
potato leafroll virus (PLRV) [3,4]). 

Among luteovirus coat protein sequences in general, several highly conserved
domains can be identified, while other domains differentiate group 1 isolates
from group 2 and other luteoviruses. Sequence comparisons between the genomes
of PLRV, BWYV and BYDV have revealed ~65% protein sequence similarity 
between the capsid proteins of BWYV and PLRV and ~45% similarity between 
BYDV and PLRV [1]. The N-terminal regions of these sequences, like those of 
many plant virus capsid proteins, is highly basic. These regions may be 
involved in protein-RNA interaction.

LUTEOGP1COAT is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
luteovirus group 1 coat proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 22 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Three iterations on 
OWL30.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 48 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are fragments or family members that fail to match one 
or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 53 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
