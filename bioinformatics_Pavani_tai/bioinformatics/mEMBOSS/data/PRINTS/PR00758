ARSENICPUMP
Arsenic is a toxic metalloid whose trivalent and pentavalent ions inhibit
a variety of biochemical processes. Operons that encode arsenic resistance
have been found in multicopy plasmids from both Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria [1]. The resistance mechanism is encoded from a single
operon, which houses an anion pump. The pump has two polypeptide components:
a catalytic subunit (the ArsA protein), which functions as an oxyanion-
stimulated ATPase; and an arsenite export component (the ArsB protein), 
which is associated with the inner membrane [2]. The ArsA and ArsB proteins
are thought to form a membrane complex that functions as an anion-
translocating ATPase.

The ArsB protein is distinguished by its overall hydrophobic character, 
in keeping with its role as a membrane-associated channel. Sequence
analysis reveals the presence of 13 putative transmembrane (TM) regions.

ARSENICPUMP is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
arsenical pump ArsB membrane-associated proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif
1 spans putative TM regions 3 and 4; motif 2 includes part of the fifth TM
region; motif 3 spans the sixth TM region; motifs 4, 5 and 6 include parts
of the seventh, ninth and tenth putative TM regions; and motifs 7 and 8 span
the twelfth and final TM regions. A single iteration on OWL29.4 was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
fragments and family members that fail to make significant matches with
one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
