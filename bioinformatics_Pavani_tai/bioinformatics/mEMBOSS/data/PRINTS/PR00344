BCTRLSENSOR
The term sensor refers to a family of proteins that respond to extra-
cytoplasmic stimuli in bacteria [1-3]. Sensors are usually linked to a 
2-component regulatory system consisting of the sensor and a cytoplasmic 
regulator protein [1,3]. The cytoplasmic C-terminal portions of the sensor 
proteins show marked sequence similarity and are responsible for kinase 
activity [1,3]. Some sensor proteins are cytoplasmic and may respond to 
several external stimuli [3]. Sensors also show similarity to some 
regulatory proteins [3].

BCTRLSENSOR is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial sensor proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in
the C-terminal portion of the alignment. Four iterations on OWL11.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 33
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, both
regulatory proteins that fail to match the final motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 139 sequences, and 215
partial matches.
