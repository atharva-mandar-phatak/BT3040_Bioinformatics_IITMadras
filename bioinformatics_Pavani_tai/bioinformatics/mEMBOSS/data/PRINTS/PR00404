MADSDOMAIN
Human serum response factor (SRF) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein important
for cell proliferation and differntiation [1]. SRF function is essential
for transcriptional regulation of numerous growth-factor-inducible genes,
such as c-fos oncogene and muscle-specific actin genes. 

A core domain of around 90 amino acids is sufficient for the activities
of DNA-binding, dimerisation and interaction with accessory factors. Within
the core is a DNA-binding region, designated the MADS box [1], which is
highly similar to many eukaryotic regulatory proteins: among these are
MCM1, the regulator of cell type-specific genes in fission yeast; DSRF,
a Drosophila trachea development factor; the MEF2 family of myocyte-
specific enhancer factors; and the Agamous and Deficiens families of
plant homeotic proteins. 

Proteins belonging to the MADS family function as dimers, the primary
DNA-binding element of which is an anti-parallel coiled coil of 2
amphipathic alpha-helices, one from each subunit. The DNA wraps around
the coiled coil allowing the basic N-termini of the helices to fit into
the DNA major groove. The chain extending from the helix N-termini reaches
over the DNA backbone and penetrates into the minor groove. A 4-stranded,
anti-parallel beta-sheet packs against the coiled-coil face opposite the
DNA and is the central element of the dimerisation interface.

MADSDOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
MADS domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 12
sequences: the motifs span the full domain length - motifs 1 and 2 span
the helix, and motif 3 spans the 2-short beta-strands. Two iterations on
OWL26.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 97 sequences was identified. Eight partial matches were also
found, all of which are fragments missing part of the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 189 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
