CHLAMIDIAOM6
Three cysteine-rich proteins (also believed to be lipoproteins) make up the
extracellular matrix of the Chlamydial outer membrane [1]. They are involved 
in the essential structural integrity of both the elementary body (EB) and 
recticulate body (RB) phase. As these bacteria lack the peptidoglycan layer
common to most Gram-negative microbes, such proteins are highly important 
in the pathogenicity of the organism.

The largest of these is the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and 
constitutes around 60% of the total protein for the membrane [2]. OMP6
is the second largest, with a molecular mass of 58kDa, while the OMP3 
protein is ~15kDa [1]. MOMP is believed to elicit the strongest immune 
response, and has recently been linked to heart disease through its sequence
similarity to a murine heart-muscle specific alpha myosin [3].

The OMP6 family plays a structural role in the outer membrane during 
the EB stage of the Chlamydial cell, and different biovars show a small, yet 
highly significant, change at peptide charge level [1]. Members of this 
family include C.trachomatis, C.pneumoniae, and C.psittaci.  

CHLAMIDIAOM6 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
the Chlamydial cysteine-rich outer membrane 6 protein (OMP6) family.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length 
(~530 amino acids). Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified.
