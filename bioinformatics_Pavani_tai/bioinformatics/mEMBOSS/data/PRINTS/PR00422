TRANSFERRIN
Transferrins are eukaryotic iron-binding glycoproteins that control the
level of free iron in biological fluids [1]. The proteins have arisen by
duplication of a domain of about 340 residues, each duplicated domain
binding 1 iron atom. The iron atoms are bound by 4 conserved residues:
an aspartic acid, 2 tyrosines and a histidine [2]. All cysteines in each
domain are involved in disulphide bond formation. To date, the family
members have been shown to include blood serotransferrin (siderophilin);
milk lactotransferrin (lactoferrin); egg white ovotransferrin (conalbumin);
and membrane-associated melanotransferrin.

TRANSFERRIN is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
transferrins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
15 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
the full length of the first domain - motif 1 spans the C-terminus of beta-
strand 2 and alpha-helix 2; motif 2 spans strand 3 and helix 3, and includes
a conserved iron-binding aspartate residue; motif 3 encodes strand 5 and 
contains a conserved iron-binding tyrosine residue; motif 4 spans strand 6 
and the N-terminal portion of helix 5; motif 5 encodes helices 6 and 7 and
strand 7; motif 6 spans helix 9 and strand 8, and includes a conserved iron-
binding tyrosine residue; motif 7 spans strands 9 and 10 and the N-terminal
portion of helix 12; motif 8 encodes the C-terminal portion of helix 12 and
strands 11 and 12, and includes a conserved iron-binding histidine residue;
motif 9 includes strand 13; and motif 10 spans helices 14 and 15. Two 
iterations on SPTR39_15f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 38 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are transferrins or transferrin-like proteins
that fail to match one or more motifs.
