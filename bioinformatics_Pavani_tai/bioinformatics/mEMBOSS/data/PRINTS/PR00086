LLDHDRGNASE
L-Lactate dehydrogenase (LLDH) is the enzyme involved in the last step of 
anaerobic glycolysis [1], catalysing the NAD-dependent interconversion of 
lactate and pyruvate [2]. LLDH is a tetrameric enzyme present in prokaryote
and eukaryote organisms. In vertebrates there are 3 tissue-specific LLDH
isoenzymes: the M form (LDH-A), found largely in muscle tissue; the H form
(LDH-B), found in heart muscle; and the X form (LDH-C), found in the 
spermatozoa of birds and mammals [1]. An evolutionary relationship exists
between LLDH and L-2-deoxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (L-hicDH), an enzyme
that catalyses the reversible and stereospecific interconversion between
2-ketocarboxylic acids and L-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids.

LLDHDRGNASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
L-lactate dehydrogenases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs surround the active site, motif 5
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern L_LDH (PS00064), the
conserved His of which is essential for the catalytic activity. Two
iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 48 sequences was identified, including an
L-2-deoxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. Eight partial matches were also
found, all of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 101 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
