GTPRANTC4
The small nuclear protein Ran (or TC4) binds and hydrolyses GTP, and has
been implicated in a large number of processes: e.g., nucleocytoplasmic
transport; RNA synthesis, processing and export; and cell cycle check-
point control [1,2].

Ran is a distant relative of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding
proteins [3]. It principally differs from the Ras family in bearing an
acidic C-terminus, rather than having C-terminal cysteine residues, which
in Ras are subject to prenylation. Nevertheless, in common with Ras
proteins, it requires a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor and a
specific GTPase activating protein to stimulate overall GTPase activity.

GTPRANTC4 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran/Tc4 family. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 18 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
short conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif
2 encompassing part of the GTP-binding B motif (cf. PROSITE pattern RAN
(PS01115)). Two iterations on OWL29.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 25 sequences was identified. Two
partial matches were also found, both of which are fragments: CEU66216
lacks the first motif, and ATTS1902 lacks motifs 4 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 26 sequences.
