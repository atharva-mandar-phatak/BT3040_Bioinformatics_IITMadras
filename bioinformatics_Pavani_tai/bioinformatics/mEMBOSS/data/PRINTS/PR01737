FIMBRILLIN
Periodontal disease in humans is a major health problem in the developed 
world, and is caused by a number of specialised pathogens that inhabit 
the oral cavity. Amongst the bacterial species culturable from periodontal 
lesions are the streptococcal microbes S.mutans and S.sobrinus, and 
the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis [1]. The
latter bacterium has been implicated as the causative agent of peridontitis,
pulpal infections and tonsillar abcesses [1].

Adherence by P.gingivalis to the periodontal surface is mediated by its 
major virulence factor fimbriae [2]. This differs from other pathogenic 
Gram-negative bacterial polymeric Type I and IV fimbriae/pili in that it is 
much more simplified, consisting of only a monomeric fimbrillin repeating 
subunit, Fma1/FimA. Fma1/FimA has a molecular weight of 43kDa, and can 
exhibit antigenic diversity in different Porphyromonas gingivalis strains 
[2]. Unusually, this form of fimbrillin possesses a far longer leader 
peptide compared to the fimbrial subunits of other bacteria [3]. It has been  
hypothesised that this allows for the maturation of the preprotein during 
secretion [3].

Recently, a study into the different antigenic types of P.gingivalis
fimbrillin classified them into five distinct groups, depending on their 
gene sequences [4]. Investigations into the functional differences of
each type revealed that in the majority of peridontitis cases, bacterial
strains possessing the type II Fma1/FimA were the most prevalent [4]; in
healthy adults, type I strains were the most common. This has implications 
for particular strains that are associated with periodontal disease.

FIMBRILLIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin proteins. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~400 amino acids). 
Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at 
which point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified.
