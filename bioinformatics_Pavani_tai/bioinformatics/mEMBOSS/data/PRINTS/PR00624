HISTONEH5
Histone H5 is a nuclear protein involved in the condensation of nucleosome
chains into higher order structures. In this respect, it performs the same
function as histone H1, and replaces H1 in certain cells.

The structure of GH5, the globular domain (residues 22-100) of the linker
histone H5, has been solved [1,2]. The fold is similar to the DNA-binding
domain of the catabolite gene activator protein, CAP, thus providing a
possible model for the binding of GH5 to DNA. The structure comprises 3
alpha-helices and 2 short beta-strands.

HISTONEH5 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H5 histones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length - motifs 1-3 encode most of helices 1-3 res.; 
motif 4 spans the 2 beta-strands; and motifs 5-7 span a lysine-rich region
in the C-terminal section beyond the globular domain. Two iterations on
OWL29.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 9 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are closely related H1 histones.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 84
partial matches.
