SHIKIMTKNASE
Shikimate kinase (EC 2.7.1.71) catalyses the fifth step in the biosynthesis
of aromatic amino acids from chorismate (the so-called shikimate pathway) 
[1]:

	     ATP + shikimate = ADP + shikimate-3-phosphate	     

The protein is found in bacteria, plants and fungi (where it is part of
a multifunctional enzyme that catalyses five consecutive steps in this 
pathway).

In 1994, the 3D structure of shikimate kinase was predicted to be very close
to that of adenylate kinase, suggesting a functional similarity as well as
an evolutionary relationship [2]. This prediction has since been confirmed
experimentally [3]. The protein is reported to possess an alpha/beta fold,
consisting of a central sheet of five parallel beta-strands flanked by
alpha-helices [3]. Such a topology is very similar to that of adenylate
kinase [3].

SHIKIMTKNASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
shikimate kinase family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the central portion of
the alignment - motifs 3 and 4 span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern 
SHIKIMATE_KINASE (PS001128), which includes a run of 3 conserved glycines.
Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are related sequences or fragments that fail
to match one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
