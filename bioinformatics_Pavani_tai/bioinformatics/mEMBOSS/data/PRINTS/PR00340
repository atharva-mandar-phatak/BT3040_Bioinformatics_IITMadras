PIIGLNB
In Gram-negative bacteria, the activity and concentration of glutamine
synthetase (GS) is regulated in response to nitrgen source availability.
PII, a tetrameric protein encoded by the glnB gene, is a component of the
adenylation cascade involved in the regulation of GS activity [1]. In
times of nitrogen deficiency, GS is activated by deadenylation of each of
the subunits in the dodecameric GS complex [2] via a pathway stimulated by
uridylated PII. In nitrogen excess, PII is deuridylated, resulting in GS
inhibition by adenylation of each of the GS subunits [1]. PII also
regulates GS concentration at the transcriptional level by affecting the
phosphorylation of the NRI protein, which is the transcriptional activator
of the GS gene, glnA [2].

PIIGLNB is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for PII
proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motif 4 including the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern PII_GLNB_CTER (PS00638). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, B61030, which is 
similar to PII proteins but lacks the uridylation site and shows little
similarity to the C-terminal region described by motif 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 51 sequences.
