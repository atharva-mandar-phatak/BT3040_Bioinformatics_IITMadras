CCMFBIOGNSIS
Within mitochondria and bacteria, a family of related proteins is involved
in the assembly of periplasmic c-type cytochromes: these include CycK [1],
CcmF [2,3], NrfE [4] and CcbS [5]. These proteins may play a role in 
guidance of apocytochromes and haem groups for their covalent linkage 
by the cytochrome-c-haem lyase. Members of the family are probably integral
membrane proteins, with up to 16 predicted transmembrane (TM) helices. 

The gene products of the hel and ccl loci have been shown to be required
specifically for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes in the Gram-negative
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus [6]. The ccl locus contains
two genes, ccl1 and ccl2, each of which possesses typical signal sequences
to direct them to the periplasm [6]. Ccl1 is similar to proteins encoded
by chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, suggesting analogous functions in 
these organelles. It is believed that the hel-encoded proteins are required 
for the export of haem to the periplasm, where it is subsequently ligated
to the c-type apocytochromes [6]. 

The CycK and CycL proteins of Bradyrhizobium japonicum share up to 53% 
amino acid sequence identity with Rhodobacter capsulatus proteins Cc11 and
Cc12 proteins, respectively [7]. CycK and CycL proteins, which are encoded
by the cycHJKL-cluster, may form part of a cytochrome c-haem lyase complex
whose active site faces the periplasm [7]. 

CCMFBIOGNSIS is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein CcmF. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise the CCMF proteins but distinguish them from 
the rest of the cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein family. Three 
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 11 sequences was identified.
