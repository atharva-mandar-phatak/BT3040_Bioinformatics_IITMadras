KRINGLE
Kringles are autonomous structural domains, found throughout the blood 
clotting and fibrinolytic proteins. They are believed to play a role in
binding mediators (e.g., membranes, other proteins or phospholipids), and
in the regulation of proteolytic activity [1-3]. The kringle domain is 
characterised by a triple loop, 3-disulphide bridge structure, whose 
conformation is defined by a number of hydrogen bonds and small pieces of 
anti-parallel beta-sheet.

KRINGLE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
kringle domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 
7 sequences (after McMullen [1]): the motifs span the full domain length,
motif 3 including the conserved hexapeptide encoded by PROSITE pattern
KRINGLE (PS00021). Four iterations on OWL11.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 34 sequences was
identified. One further sequence was of note: UROK_CHICK is not identified
unambiguously by the fingerprint - although it matches strongly with motifs
1 and 3, it fails to match motifs 2 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 53 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
