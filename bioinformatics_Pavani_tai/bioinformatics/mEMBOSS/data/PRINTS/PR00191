FACTINCAPA
The actin filament system, a prominent part of the cytoskeleton in 
eukaryotic cells, is both a static structure and a dynamic network that
can undergo rearrangements: it is thought to be involved in processes
such as cell movement and phagocytosis [1], as well as muscle contraction.
Capping proteins bind to the ends of actin filaments, blocking the addition
of actin monomers at this end. The capping protein is a heterodimer of alpha
and beta subunits [2]: it binds to the barbed end of actin filaments, but
unlike gelsolin and severin does not sever the filament [1]. Neither of the
subunits shows sequence similarity to other filament-capping proteins [1].

FACTINCAPA is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
F-actin capping protein alpha subunit. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs span conserved regions
located in the C-terminal half of the alignment, motifs 2 and 3 including
the regions encoded by PROSITE patterns F_ACTIN_CAPPING_A_1 (PS00748) and
F_ACTIN_CAPPING_A_2 (PS00749). Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
