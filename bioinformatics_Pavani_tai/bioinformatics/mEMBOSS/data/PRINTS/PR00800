YHDCRBOXLASE
A number of pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases share regions of sequence
similarity, particularly in the vicinity of a conserved lysine residue,
which provides the attachment site for the pyridoxal-phosphate group [1,2].
Among these enzymes are aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (L-dopa
decarboxylase or tryptophan decarboxylase), which catalyses the 
decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine [3]; tyrosine decarboxylase,
which converts tyrosine into tyramine; and histidine decarboxylase, which 
catalyses the decarboxylation of histidine to histamine [4]. These enzymes
belong to the group II decarboxylases [1,3].

YHDCRBOXLASE is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylases and related enzymes. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs
3-7 span an N-terminally located tandem repeat region, motifs 3-5 lying in 
the first repeat, and motifs 6 and 7 lying in the second. Two iterations on
OWL29.4 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 28 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are fragments and family members that fail to make
significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 35 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
