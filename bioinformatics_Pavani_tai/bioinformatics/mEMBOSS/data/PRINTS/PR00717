GPCRKINASE
Rapid regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involves agonist-
promoted receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs) [1]. This process
is followed by arrestin binding and transient receptor internalisation. 
It has been shown that beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK-1 or GRK2)
follows a similar pattern of internalisation upon agonist activation of
beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)AR) and that beta ARK expression
levels modulate receptor sequestration [1]. Such studies indicate a
functional relationship between receptor phosphorylation and sequestration,
showing that beta ARK not only translocates from the cytoplasm to the
plasma membrane in response to receptor occupancy, but also shares
endocytic mechanisms with the beta(2)AR [1]. These results suggest a role
for beta ARK in the sequestration process, or involvement of receptor
internalisation in the intracellular trafficking of the kinase [1].

GPCRKINASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
GPCR kinases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 
6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions within the
central kinase domain. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 35 sequences was
identified. Three partial matches were also found, all of which are family
members that fail to make significant matches with motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 42 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
