ADHESIVEI
An impressive property of mussels is their ability to stick to wet surfaces.
Exactly how they do this is unclear, but they are known to exploit bundles
of threads, each of which has a fibrous collagenous core coated with 
adhesive proteins [1]. These proteins are able to displace water from a wet
surface and then set to form tight junctions.

The adhesive protein of Mytilus coruscus contains 848 amino acids, including
a 20-residue signal peptide, a 21-residue non-repetitive linker and a 
repetitive domain that constitutes the bulk of the protein [2]. The 
representative repeat motif of this domain, YKPK(I/P)(S/T)YPP(T/S), is
similar to that of M.galloprovincialis [2]. The codon usage patterns for 
the same amino acids differ in different positions of the decapeptide motif
[1,2]. Almost identical nucleotide sequences appear several times in the
repetitive region, suggesting that mussel adhesive protein genes have
evolved through repeat duplication [2]. 

The repeat motif is reminiscent of repeat units found in extensins, a group
of plant proteins involved in the strengthening of the cell wall in response
to mechanical stress.

ADHESIVEI is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for mussel
adhesive plaque proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the N-terminal portion of the alignment - motif 5 spans two deca-
peptide repeat units. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being  identified beyond the starting set

An update on SPTR55_38f identified a true set comprising 6 sequences.
