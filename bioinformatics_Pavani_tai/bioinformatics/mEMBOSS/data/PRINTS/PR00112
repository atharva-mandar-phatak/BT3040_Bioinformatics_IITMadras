ACYLPHPHTASE
Acylphosphatase is an enzyme of approximately 98 amino acid residues that 
specifically catalyses the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond of
acylphosphates [1], its substrates including 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and 
carbamyl phosphate [2]. It is distributed in a tissue-specific manner in a 
wide variety of species, although its physiological role is as yet unknown
[2]: it may, however, play a part in the regulation of the glycolytic 
pathway and pyrimidine biosynthesis [3]. The enzyme has a mainly beta-sheet
structure with 2 short alpha-helical segments.

ACYLPHPHTASE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
acylphosphatases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
5 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 include regions encoded by PROSITE patterns
ACYLPHOSPHATASE_1 (PS00150) and ACYLPHOSPHATASE_2 (PS00151), the former
involving the first beta-strand, the latter spanning the end of the first
helix and the 2nd and 3rd strands; and motif 3 spans the 4th beta-strand.
Two iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences.
