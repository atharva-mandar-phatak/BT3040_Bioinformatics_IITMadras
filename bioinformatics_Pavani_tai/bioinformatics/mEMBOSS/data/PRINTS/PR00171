SUGRTRNSPORT
The sugar transporters belong to a family of membrane proteins responsible 
for the transport of various sugars in a wide range of prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic organisms [1]. The similarity between the sugar transporters in 
such diverse organisms as bacteria and mammals is considered too great to 
have arisen from convergent evolution. Gene transfer from eukaryotes to 
their prokaryotic symbionts has been suggested, but it is more likely that 
the transporters have evolved from an ancient protein present in living 
organisms before the divergence into prokaryotes and eukaryotes [2]. In 
mammals, these proteins are expressed in a number of organs [3]. 

SUGRTRNSPORT is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for a 
superfamily of sugar transporters. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn largely from
transmembrane (TM) domains (i.e. 1, 4, 7 and 10), motif 5 corresponding to
the conserved loop between the tenth and eleventh TM regions (the
remaining TM domains were not sufficiently well conserved to be able to
characterise the superfamily). Three iterations on OWL11.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 32 sequences
was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 120 sequences, and 49
partial matches.
