ARGINASE
Arginase, which catalyses the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine,
is one of the five members of the urea cycle enzymes that convert ammonia
to urea as the principal product of nitrogen excretion [1]. There are
several arginase isozymes: a liver isozyme takes part in the final step of
the urea cycle in ureotelic animals [2]; other isozymes take part in the
first step of arginine degradation in various cell types (the kidney, small
intestine and lactating mammary glands) [3], and differ in catalytic,
molecular and immunological properties [2]. Deficiency in the liver isozyme
leads to argininemia, which is usually associated with hyperammonemia [2].

ARGINASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
arginases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motifs 1 and 4 including the regions encoded by
PROSITE patterns ARGINASE_1 (PS00147) and ARGINASE_2 (PS00148). Two
iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 8 sequences identified. A single partial match was
found, HUTG_KLEAE, a histidine utilization protein fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 11
partial matches.
