ZPELLUCIDA
A large domain, containing around 260 amino acids, has been recognised in a
variety of receptor-like eukaryotic glycoproteins [1]. These include: sperm
receptor ZP2 and ZP3, which are responsible for sperm adhesion in the zona
pellucida; glycoprotein GP2, which is the major component of pancreatic
secretory granule membranes; TGF-beta receptor type III, which is a 
proteoglycan that binds to TGF-beta; and uromodulin, which is a urinary
glycoprotein of unknown function. All of these are mosaic proteins, each
containing an extracellular region followed by either a TM domain and a
short cytoplasmic region, or by a GPI-anchor. The domain common to all
these proteins is located in the C-terminal portion of the extracellular
region, and contains 8 conserved Cys residues, which are probably involved
in disulphide bond formation.

ZPELLUCIDA is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
zona pellucida sperm-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions encompassing virtually the full domain length and include
5 conserved Cys residues - motifs 4 and 5 span the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern ZP_DOMAIN (PS00682). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18
sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also found, all of
which are family members that fail to make significant matches with one
or more of the motifs. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 34 sequences, and 39
partial matches.
