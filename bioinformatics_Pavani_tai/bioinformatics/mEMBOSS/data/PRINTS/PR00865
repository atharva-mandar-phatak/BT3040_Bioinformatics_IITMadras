HPVCAPSIDL1
Papillomaviruses are members of the papovavirus superfamily. More than
70 different types of papillomavirus have been discovered in humans, some
of which have been shown to cause genital carcinomas and cutaneous
warts. The viruses contain a circular dsDNA genome surrounded by an 
icosahedral capsid. Two proteins are involved in capsid formation: a major
(L1) and  minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%.
Experiments have indicated that intermolecular disulphide bonding is 
responsible for cohesion of the L1 capsid proteins [1].

HPVCAPSIDL1 is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the major L1 protein in the papillomavirus capsid. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 18 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iterations on OWL29.6 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 106 sequence was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are fragments that lack one or more motifs:
AF001600 fails to match motif 11; those with 5 motifs match motifs 4-8; two
distinct groups of fragment match three motifs, namely 3-5 and 6-8; and
almost all with 2 motifs match motifs 9 and 10. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 100 sequences.
