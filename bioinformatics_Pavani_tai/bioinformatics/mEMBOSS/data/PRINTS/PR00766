CUDAOXIDASE
Amiloride binding protein (ABP) is found in a variety of epithelium-rich 
and hematopoietic tissues [1]. The protein binds amiloride and some of its
derivatives, including phenamil, benzamil and ethylpropylamiloride [1,2].
ABP has diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, catalysing the degradation of 
compounds such as putrescine, histamine, spermine and spermidine [1];
these substances are involved in a range of activities, including allergic
and immune responses, cell proliferation, tissue differentiation, tumour
formation and possibly apoptosis. Placental DAO is thought to play a role
in the regulation of female reproductive function [2].

The protein acts as a disulphide-linked homodimer. The catalysed reaction, 
RCH(2)NH(2) + H(2)O + O(2) = RCHO + NH(3) + H(2)O(2), requires copper and 
topaquinone as cofactors.

CUDAOXIDASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
copper-containing diamine oxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif VII contains
the putative amiloride-binding aspartate and a potential copper-binding
histidine residue. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was found, RNU72632, a rat membrane
amine oxidase N-terminal fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences.
