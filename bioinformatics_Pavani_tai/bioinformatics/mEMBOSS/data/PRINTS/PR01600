ZONOCCLUDNS3
Zona occludens (ZO), or tight junctions (TJ), are specialised membrane 
domains found at the most apical region of polarised epithelial and endo-
thelial cells that create a primary barrier, preventing paracellular 
transport of solutes, and restricting the lateral diffusion of membrane 
lipids and proteins, thus maintaining cellular polarity [1]. Under freeze-
fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a network of continuous 
anastomosing intramembranous strands. These strands consist mainly of 
claudins and occludin, which are transmembrane proteins that polymerise 
within plasma membranes to form fibrils [2].

The zona occuldens proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3) are a family of TJ- 
associated proteins that function as cross-linkers, anchoring the TJ strand 
proteins to the actin-based cytoskeleton [3,4]. Each protein contains three 
PDZ (postsynaptic density, disc-large, ZO-1) domains, a single SH3 (Src 
Homology-3) domain and a GK (guanylate kinase) domain, the presence of which
identifies them as members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase 
(MAGUK) protein family. They also share an acidic domain at the C-terminal 
region of the molecules not found in other MAGUK proteins. It has been 
demonstrated that the first PDZ domain is involved in binding the C-terminal
-Y-V motif of claudins [4]. By contrast, the occludin-binding domain of
ZO-1 has been shown to lie in the GK and acidic domains [5]. Although the
precise location of the actin-binding motif has not been elucidated, it 
appears to be within the C-terminal half of the molecules, since 
transfection of this region into fibroblasts induces co-localisation 
of ZO-1 and ZO-2 with actin fibres [5].

ZO-3 was first identified as a 130kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitates
with ZO-1 [6]. It shares ~65% overall similarity with ZO-1 and ZO-2 
proteins, with highest levels of similarity in the MAGUK and acid domains.
In vitro binding studies indicate that ZO-3 may interact directly with ZO-1
through its second PDZ domain, although it does not appear to bind directly
to ZO-2 [7].

ZONOCCLUDNS3 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
zona occludens protein ZO-3. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections 
that characterise ZO-3 but distinguish it from other family members - motif
1 lies between the first and second PDZ domain; motifs 2 and 3 reside 
between the SH3 and GK domains; motif 4 encodes part of the GK domain; and
motif 5 lies beyond the GK domain in the C-terminal portion of the
alignment. A single iteration on SPTR39.22_17.3f was required to reach 
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
