GONADOLIBRNI
Reproduction is controlled in humans by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
axis [1]. A key molecule in this control circuit is the decapeptide 
luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), also termed gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) [1]. GnRH is produced by hypothalamic neurones, 
secreted in a pulsatile manner into the capillary plexus of the median 
eminence and mediates the release of luteinising hormone and follicle 
stimulating hormone from gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary [1].
The peptide may have additional functions, as LHRH or LHRH-like immuno-
reactivity has been found in gonadal tissue, placenta and the central
nervous system, and exogenously administered LHRH affects behaviour [1].

The GnRH decapeptide is processed from a larger precursor protein termed
progonadoliberin I, which also contains prolactin release-inhibiting factor 
I.

GONADOLIBRNI is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
progonadoliberin precursor. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 contains the gonado-
liberin I decapeptide; and motifs 2-4 span the prolactin release-inhibiting
factor I. Two iterations on SPTR39_15f were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also found, Q9IAU2, a frog gonadoliberin sequence that
matches motifs 1 and 2.
