TRANSAMINASE
Aminotransferases share certain mechanistic features with other pyridoxal-
phosphate dependent enzymes, such as the covalent binding of the pyridoxal-
phosphate group to a lysine residue [1].

TRANSAMINASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
aspartate aminotransferases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment. Five iterations on SPTR57_40f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 
1048 sequences was identified. Thirty eight partial matches were also found,
which are all family members that fail to make significant matches with one
or more motifs.
