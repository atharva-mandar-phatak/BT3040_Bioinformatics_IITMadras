HUNTINGTIN
Huntington's disease (HD) is a mid-life onset, inherited, neurodegenerative
disorder characterised by motor impairment, involuntary movements (chorea),
psychiatric disorders and dementia [1,2]. The disease results from the
expansion of a polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat in a gene of unknown
function. Moderate expansion of glutamine-coding CAG repeats has been
found in other neurological diseases (e.g. spinobulbar muscular atrophy
and Machado-Joseph disease), in all of which the pathological mechanism
linked to the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the protein remains
a mystery.

The HD transcript is highly conserved, significant differences, as already
noted, occurring in the N-terminal Gln-repeat region. Huntingtin normally
contains 10-35 repeats, but shows 36-120 repeats in the disease form.
Migration differences between normal and mutated huntingtin in a denaturing
polyacrylamide gel suggest that the poly-Gln stretch disrupts the protein
conformation [2]. This finding is consistent with the observation that
Gln repeats may form tightly-linked beta-sheets that could act as polar
zippers [3]. 

HUNTINGTIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Huntington's disease protein. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, but not including the 
N-terminal poly-glutamine region. A single iteration on OWL26.0 was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
