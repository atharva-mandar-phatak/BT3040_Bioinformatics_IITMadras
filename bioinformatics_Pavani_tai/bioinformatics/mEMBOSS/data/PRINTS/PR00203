AMYLOIDA4
Amyloid A4 protein precursor (APP) is an integral, glycosylated membrane
brain protein. APP contains a 40-residue peptide, known as beta-amyloid
protein (beta-APP), which forms the major constituent of the amyloid
deposits that characterise Alzheimer's disease and aged Down's Syndrome. The
exact function of APP is unknown, but it may mediate cell-cell inter-
actions. The protein comprises a large extracellular N-terminal domain,
and a short hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, followed by a short
C-terminal region - the beta amyloid protein both precedes and forms 
part of the transmembrane domain [1-3].

AMYLOIDA4 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
amyloid A4 protein precursor. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: motif 1 includes the extracellular region encoded
by PROSITE pattern A4_EXTRA (PS00319); motif 3 corresponds to the trans-
membrane domain; and motif 4 includes the cytoplasmic region encoded by
PROSITE pattern A4_INTRA (PS00320). Two iterations on OWL21.1 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10 sequences was
identified. Six partial matches were also found, most of which are
fragments: YWK2_RAT is a sperm membrane protein known to share a high
degree of similarity with the A4 amyloid protein towards its C-terminus.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
