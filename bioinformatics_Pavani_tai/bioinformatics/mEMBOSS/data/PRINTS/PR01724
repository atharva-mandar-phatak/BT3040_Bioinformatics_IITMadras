GABAARPI
Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are members of the neuro-
transmitter ligand-gated ion channels: they mediate neuronal inhibition on
binding GABA. The effects of GABA on GABAA receptors are modulated by a range
of therapeutically important drugs, including barbiturates, anaesthetics and
benzodiazepines (BZs) [1,2]. The BZs are a diverse range of compounds,
including widely prescribed drugs, such as librium and valium, and their
interaction with GABAA receptors provides the most potent pharmacological
means of distinguishing different GABAA receptor subtypes [1].

GABAA receptors are pentameric membrane proteins that operate GABA-gated
chloride channels [3]. Eight types of receptor subunit have been cloned,
with multiple subtypes within some classes: alpha 1-6, beta 1-4, gamma 1-4,
delta, epsilon, pi, rho 1-3 and theta [4,5]. Subunits are typically 50-60kDa
in size and comprise a long N-terminal extracellular domain, containing
a putative signal peptide and a disulphide-bonded beta structural loop; 4
putative transmembrane (TM) domains; and a large cytoplasmic loop connecting
the third and fourth TM domains [2]. Amongst family members, the large
cytoplasmic loop displays the most divergence in terms of primary structure,
the TM domains showing the highest level of sequence conservation [6].

Evidence suggests that the structure of GABAA receptors is analagous to that
of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, namely a pentameric protein with
the ion channel located in the centre of a rosette formed between five 
homologous subunits [4]. The majority of receptors contain one type of alpha
and beta subunit, and a single gamma polypeptide in a ratio of 2:2:1 [1].

The existence of a pi subunit was first reported in 1997, where it was
detected in a number of human and rat tissues. The subunit shares 30-40%
amino acid identity with other members of the GABAA receptor subunit family.
The polypeptide is found in several peripheral tissues, including the
uterus, where its function appears to be related to tissue contractility: pi
subunits can co-assemble with other GABAA receptor subunits to form
recombinant receptors with altered sensitivity to pregnenalone [7].   

GABAARPI is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for GABAA
receptor pi subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the 
full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise pi 
subunits but distinguish them from the rest of the GABAA receptor subunit 
family - motifs 1-3 reside within the presumed extracellular N-terminal 
region, motif 1 encoding the putative signal peptide; and motif 4 lies in
the large cytoplasmic loop between TM domains 3 and 4. A single iteration
on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.
