GATASE
Glutamine amidotransferase activity involves the removal of the ammonia 
group from a glutamate molecule and its subsequent transfer to a specific 
substrate, thus creating a new carbon-nitrogen group on the substrate. This
activity is found in a range of biosynthetic enzymes, including glutamine 
amidotransferase, anthranilate synthase component II, p-aminobenzoate, and 
glutamine-dependent carbamoyl-transferase (CPSase). Glutamine amidotrans-
ferase (GATase) domains can occur either as single polypeptides, as in
glutamine amidotransferases, or as domains in a much larger multifunctional
synthase protein, such as CPSase.

GATASE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the super-
family of enzymes that have glutamine amidotransferase activity. The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: motif 1
encodes an area that is well conserved in all GATases, and motif 2 spans
the glutamine binding site (cf. PROSITE pattern GATASE_TYPE_I (PS00442)).
Three iterations on OWL17.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 47 sequences was identified. Fifteen partial
matches were also found: these include amidotransferase HisH; GMP synthase;
CTP synthase and ammonia-dependent CPSase proteins; as well as anthranilate
synthase component II fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 119 sequences, and 55
partial matches.
