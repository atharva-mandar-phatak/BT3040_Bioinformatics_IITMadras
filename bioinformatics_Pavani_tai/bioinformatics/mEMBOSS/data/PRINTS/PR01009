FLGMRINGFLIF
The flgH, flgI and fliF genes of Salmonella typhimurium encode the major 
proteins for the L, P and M rings of the flagellar basal body [1]. In fact,
the basal body consists of four rings (L,P,S and M) surrounding the
flagellar rod, which is believed to transmit motor rotation to the filament 
[2]. The M ring is integral to the inner membrane of the cell, and may be
connected to the rod via the S (supramembrane) ring, which lies just distal
to it. The L and P rings reside in the outer membrane and periplasmic space,
respectively.

The sequences of the FlgH, FlgI and FliF gene products have been determined
[1]. FlgH and FlgI, have typical N-terminal cleaved signal-peptide sequences 
[1,3] and are predicted to have extensive beta-sheet structures [1]. By 
contrast, FliF lacks a signal peptide and is predicted to have considerable 
alpha-helical structure, including an N-terminal sequence that is likely
to be membrane-spanning [1]. Overall, however, FliF has a relatively
hydrophilic sequence, with a high charge density, especially towards its 
C-terminus [1]. Several aspects of the DNA sequence of these genes and 
their surrounds suggest complex regulation of the flagellar gene system. 

FLGMRINGFLIF is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
flagellar M-ring proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the central portion of the alignment. Four iterations on OWL30.2
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
10 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
