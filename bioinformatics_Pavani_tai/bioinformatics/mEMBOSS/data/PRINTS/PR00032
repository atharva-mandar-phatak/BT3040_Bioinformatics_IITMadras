HTHARAC
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family groups together a range of proteins, including
aadA, appY, aracC, celD, envY, exsA, fapR, melR, mmsR, rhaR, rhaS, rns,
soxS, tetD, virF and xylS [1-4]. Although the sequences belonging to this
family differ somewhat in length, in each case the HTH motif is situated 
towards the C-terminus.

HTHARAC is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the araC 
bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs completely encompass the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern HTH_ARAC_FAMILY (PS00041), which includes a
conserved region 30 residues after the DNA-binding domain. Four iterations
on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 42 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 119 sequences.
