BRSTCANCERI
Breast cancer is a common malignancy, affecting 1 in 8 women. A major
contributary factor in disease development lies in a positive family
history, a correlation that is striking for early-onset breast cancer.
Mutations in BRCA1 are believed to be responsible for 45% of inherited
breast cancer and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancer.

The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and
ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids [1]. The protein
contains an N-terminal zinc-finger domain, but otherwise appears unrelated
to currently known protein families. It is hoped that BRCA1 will both
facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, and  
provide a better understanding of breast cancer biology [1].

BRSTCANCERI is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
breast cancer type I susceptibility proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing
on domains in which mutations have been linked to disease development. A
single iteration on OWL27.0 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match
was also found, MMU33835, a fragment that matches motifs 3 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences, and 1
partial match.
