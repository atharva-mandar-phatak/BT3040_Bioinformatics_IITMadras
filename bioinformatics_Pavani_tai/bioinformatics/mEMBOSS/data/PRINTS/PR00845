GLHYDRLASE52
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 52 encompasses the beta-xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37) [5].

Proteins harboring beta-xylosidase and xylanase activities have been
identified in the Gram-positive, facultative thermophilic aerobe Bacillus
stearothermophilus 21 [5]. This microbe, which functions in xylan 
degradation, can utilise xylan as a sole source of carbon. The enzyme
hydrolyses 1,4-beta-D-xylans, removing successive D-xylose residues from 
the non-reducing termini. It also hydrolyses xylobiose.

GLHYDRLASE52 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 52 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. Two iterations on OWL30.0 
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
3 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
