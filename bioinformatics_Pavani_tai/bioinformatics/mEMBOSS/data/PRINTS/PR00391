PITRANSFER
Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) is a ubiquitous cytosolic
protein, thought to be involved in transport of phospholipids from their
site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to other cell
membranes [1]. More recently, PITP has been shown to be an essential
component of the polyphosphoinositide synthesis machinery and is hence
required for proper signalling by epidermal growth factor and f-Met-Leu-Phe,
as well as for exocytosis. The role of PITP in polyphosphoinositide
synthesis may also explain its involvement in intracellular vesicular
traffic [1].

PITRANSFER is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
