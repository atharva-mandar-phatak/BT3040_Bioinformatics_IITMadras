PHPHLIPASED
Phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase D is an extracellular
amphiphilic glycoprotein [1,2]: it hydrolyses the inositol phosphate linkage
in proteins anchored by phosphatidylinositol glycans, releasing these
proteins from the membrane. The enzyme catalyses the reaction: glycoprotein
phosphatidylinositol + H(2)O = phosphatidate + glycoprotein inositol.

PHPHLIPASED is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
phospholipase D. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL29.3 was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. A single partial match was found, PHLD_HUMAN,
a composite sequence a phospholipase D fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
