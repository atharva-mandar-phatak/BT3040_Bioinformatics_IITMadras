RAD1REC1
REC1 of Ustilago maydis plays a key role in regulating the genetic system
of the fungus. REC1 mutants are very sensitive to UV light - mutation
leads to a complex phenotype with alterations in DNA repair, recombination,
mutagenesis, meiosis and cell division [1]. The predicted product of the
REC1 gene is a polypeptide of 522 amino acid residues with molecular mass 
57 kDa. The protein shows 3'-->5' exonuclease activity, but only in cells
over-expressing REC1 [1]. While it is distinguishable from the major
bacterial nucleases, the protein has certain enzymatic features in common
with epsilon, the proof-reading exonuclease subunit of E.coli DNA polymerase
III holoenzyme [1].

The rad1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe comprises three exons and encodes
a 37kDa protein that exhibits partial similarity to the REC1 gene of 
Ustilago maydis [2]. The two genes share putative functional similarities
in their respective organisms. 

RAD1REC1 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Rad1
repair and related Rec1 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 7 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found,
both of which are related Rad-like proteins that match 2 motifs.
