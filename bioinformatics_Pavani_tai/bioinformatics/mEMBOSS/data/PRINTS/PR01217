PRICHEXTENSN
Extensins are plant cell-wall proteins; they can account for up to 20% of
the dry weight of the cell wall [1]. They are highly-glycosylated, possibly
reflecting their interactions with cell-wall carbohydrates. Amongst their 
functions is cell wall strengthening in response to mechanical stress (e.g.,
during attack by pests, plant-bending in the wind, etc.). Their amino acid
sequences are characterised by a number of tyr-thr-pro-ser-pro-lys-pro-pro 
octapeptide repeats, and other pro-lys-thr-rich regions.

PRICHEXTENSN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
proline-rich extensins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved repeat
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 8 spans the
proline-rich C-terminus. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q40692, a rice 
hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein that is closely similar but differs
slightly in its repeat motifs.
