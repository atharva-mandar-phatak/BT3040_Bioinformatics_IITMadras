FRACTALKINER
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a vast protein family that
encompasses a wide range of functions (including various autocrine,
para-crine and endocrine processes). They show considerable diversity at the
sequence level, on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct
groups. We use the term clan to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group
of families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship,
but between which there is no statistically significant similarity in
sequence [1,2]. The currently known clan members include the rhodopsin-like
GPCRs, the secretin-like GPCRs, the cAMP receptors, the fungal mating
pheromone receptors, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor family.

The rhodopsin-like GPCRs themselves represent a widespread protein family
that includes hormone, neurotransmitter and light receptors, all of 
which transduce extracellular signals through interaction with guanine
nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Although their activating ligands vary
widely in structure and character, the amino acid sequences of the
receptors are very similar and are believed to adopt a common structural
framework comprising 7 transmembrane (TM) helices [3-5].

Chemokines are proteins that have important physiological and patho-
physiological roles in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory
processes [6]. Their sequences are similar and are characterised by a
4-cysteine motif: the family can be divided according to whether the first 2
Cys residues are adjacent (the C-C family), or separated by an intervening
residue (the C-x-C family). 

Two additional chemokine families have also been identified, each containing
only one member. C chemokines have only one of the first two Cys residues,
while C-x3-C chemokines contain both cysteines, separated by three
intervening residues [7]. The only C-x3-C chemokine identified to date is
fractalkine, a TM molecule containing a chemokine domain on an extended
mucin-like stalk [7,8]. The membrane-bound form of fractalkine can be 
induced on endothelial cells in response to inflammation, and promotes
adhesion of monocytes and T lymphocytes. The chemokine can also be released
in a soluble form, which causes chemotaxis of monocytes and T cells [7,8].

Both the adhesive and chemotactic effects of fractalkine are mediated 
through a G protein-coupled receptor - CX3CR1. CX3CR1 is expressed 
specifically on T cells, natural killer cells and monocytes and has closest 
similarity to the C-C chemokine receptors. Coupling of the receptor to 
pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins leads to calcium mobilisation and 
chemotaxis. In contrast, adhesion mediated by the receptor is insensitive to
pertussis toxin and does not appear to involve calcium mobilisation [7]. 
CX3CR1 has also been found to act as a weak fusion cofactor for some HIV-1 
strains, an interaction that can be potently and specifically blocked by 
fractalkine [8].

FRACTALKINER is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
fractalkine receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that
characterise the fractalkine receptors but distinguish them from the rest of
the chemokine receptor family - motif 1 resides at the N-terminus; motif 2
spans part of the N-terminus, leading into TM domain 1; motif 3 spans the
second cytoplasmic loop; motif 4 encodes the C-terminal portion of TM domain
4, leading into the second external loop; motif 5 lies in the second
external loop, leading into TM domain 5; motif 6 spans the third external
loop; and motifs 7-9 reside at the C-terminus. A single iteration on
SPTR39.22_17.3f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences 
being identified beyond the starting set.
