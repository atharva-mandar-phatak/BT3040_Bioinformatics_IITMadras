MAMMALPTPASE
Low molecular weight (LMW) phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (or acid
phosphatase) acts on tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, low-MW aryl
phosphates and natural and synthetic acyl phosphates [1,2]. It is a
cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyses the reaction:
protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein tyrosine + orthophosphate.

The structure of the protein has been solved by NMR [3]. It belongs to the
alpha/beta class, with 6 alpha-helices and 4 beta-strands forming a 3-layer
alpha-beta-alpha sandwich architecture.

MAMMALPTPASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
mammalian low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length - motif 1 spans the C-terminus of helix 1 and helix 2;
motif 2 includes helix 4; motif 3 spans the third beta-strand and helix 5;
motif 4 includes the second beta-strand; and motif 5 encompasses helix 6.
Two iterations on OWL29.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
