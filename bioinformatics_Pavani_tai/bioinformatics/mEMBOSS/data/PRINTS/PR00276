INSULINFAMLY
The insulin family of proteins groups together several evolutionarily
related active peptides [1]: these include insulin [2,3], relaxin [4,5],
insect prothoracicotropic hormone (bombyxin) [6], insulin-like growth
factors (IGF1 and IGF2) [7,8], mammalian Leydig cell-specific insulin-like
peptide (gene INSL3), early placenta insulin-like peptide (ELIP) (gene
INSL4), locust insulin-related peptide (LIRP), molluscan insulin-related
peptides (MIP), and Caenorhabditis elegans insulin-like peptides. The 3D
structures of a number of family members have been determined [7-9]. The
fold comprises two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by two disulphide
bonds: all share a conserved arrangement of 4 cysteines in their A chain,
the first of which is linked by a disulphide bond to the third, while the
second and fourth are linked by interchain disulphide bonds to cysteines
in the B chain.

INSULINFAMLY is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
insulin family proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 77 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the two conserved 
regions that delineate the A and B chains, motif 1 spanning the B chain and 
motif 2 spanning the A chain. Six iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 440 sequences was
identified.
