PHAGEIV
Gene IV proteins are filamentous bacteriophage proteins [1,2]. Their exact
function is unknown, but they are thought to be involved in phage assembly
and morphogenesis. The proteins are related to the bacterial general
secretion pathway D (GSPD) family.

PHAGEIV is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the gene
IV protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length - motifs 8 and 9 span part of the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern T2SP_D (PS00875). Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.
Several partial matches were also found, all of which are family members
or homologues that match only motifs 3 and 5: S64727 and AF044261 are
members of the type II secretion family; and GSPD_PSEAE is a member of the
GSPD family.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
