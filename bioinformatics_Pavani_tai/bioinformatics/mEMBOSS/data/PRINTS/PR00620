HISTONEH2A
Histone H2A is a small, highly conserved nuclear protein that, together
with 2 molecules each of histones H2B, H3 and H4, forms the eukaryotic
nucleosome core [1]; the nucleosome octamer winds ~146 DNA base-pairs.

HISTONEH2A is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H2A histones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 23
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length - motif 1 includes the N-terminal region encoded by
PROSITE pattern HISTONE_H2A (PS00046). Two iterations on OWL29.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 84
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of
which are histone H2A related proteins and fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 105 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
