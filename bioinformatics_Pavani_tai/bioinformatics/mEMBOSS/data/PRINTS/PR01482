PERTACTIN
Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative, aerobic coccobacillus that causes 
pertussis (whooping cough), especially in young children [1]. Once present 
in the lungs, the bacterium attaches to ciliated pulmonary epithelial cells 
via a collection of outer membrane proteins, all of which are virulence 
factors [1].

Pertactin, or P69 protein, is one of these virulence factors. Pertactin and
filamentous haemagglutinin have been identified as bordetella adhesins [2]. 
Both proteins contain an arg-gly-asp (RGD) motif that promotes binding to
integrins, known to be important in cell mobility and development [2]. The
production of most bordetella virulence factors (including pertactin) is 
controlled by a two-component signal transduction system, comprising the
BvgA regulator and the BvgS sensor [3]. Pertactin shares a high level of
similarity with other bordetella adhesins, such as BrkA [3]. The protein is
first produced as a 93kDa precursor. Upon secretion into the extracellular
environment, a 30kDa domain at the C-terminus remains in the outer membrane,
while the mature 60.4kDa pertactin molecule is released [4].

The crystal structure of mature pertactin has been determined to 2.5A 
resolution by means of X-ray diffraction {4]. The fold is characterised by
a 16-stranded parallel beta-helix, with a V-shaped cross-section. Several
between-strand amino-acid repeats form internal and external ladders [4].
The helical structure is interrupted by several protruding loops that
contain motifs associated with the activity of the protein [4]. One 
such sequence - [GGXXP]5 - appears directly after the RGD motif, and may
mediate interaction with epithelial cells [4]. The C-terminal region of
P.69 pertactin contains a [PQP]5 motif loop, which contains the major
immunoprotective epitope [4]. 

PERTACTIN is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
Bordetella pertussis pertactins. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1 spans beta-
strands 1 and 2; motif 2 includes strands 5 and 6; motif 3 spans strands 7
and 8; motif 4 spans strands 9-11; motif 5 includes strands 16 and 17; motif
6 includes strands 20 and 21, and contains the conserved Arg of the RGD
attachment site; motif 7 spans strands 22-24; motif 8 spans strands 25-27;
motif 9 spans strands 34-36; motif 10 spans strands 38-40 and alpha-helix 2;
and motif 11 encodes strands 41 and 42. Two iterations on SPTR39_15f were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found: O86044 is a
B.pertussis putative autotransporter that matches motifs 8-11; and Q45340
is the B.pertussis BrkA, which matches motifs 4 and 11.
