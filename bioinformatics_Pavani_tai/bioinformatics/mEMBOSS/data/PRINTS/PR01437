NUOXDRDTASE4
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase is part of complex I of respiratory chains,
which catalyses the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in a
reaction that is associated with proton translocation across the membrane [1]:
              NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol. 

Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a maternally-inherited disease 
characterised by optic nerve degeneration and cardiac dysrhythmia [2]. A
mitochondrial DNA replacement mutation that correlates with this disease
in multiple families has been identified [2] - the mutation converts a 
conserved arginine to a histidine at codon 340 in the NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 4 gene. This finding demonstrates that a nucleotide change in a
mitochondrial DNA energy production gene can result in a neurological
disease [2]. 

NUOXDRDTASE4 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 4. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 38 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the central portion of the alignment. Five iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 149 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are related family members that fail to match one or 
more motifs.
