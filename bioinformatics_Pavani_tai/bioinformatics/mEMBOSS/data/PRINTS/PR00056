HSFDOMAIN
Heat shock factor (HSF) is a transcriptional activator of heat shock genes
[1]: it binds specifically to heat shock promotor elements, which are
palindromic sequences rich with repetitive purine and pyrimidine motifs [1].
Under normal conditions, HSF is a homotrimeric cytoplasmic protein, but
heat shock activation results in relocalisation to the nucleus [2].

Each HSF monomer contains 1 C-terminal and 3 N-terminal leucine zipper
repeats [3]. Point mutations in these regions result in disruption of
cellular localisation, rendering the protein constitutively nuclear [2].
Two sequences flanking the N-terminal zippers fit the consensus of a bi-
partite nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Interaction between the N- and  
C-terminal zippers may result in a structure that masks the NLS sequences 
[3]: following activation of HSF, these may then be unmasked, resulting in 
relocalisation of the protein to the nucleus [3]. The DNA-binding component
of HSF lies to the N-terminus of the first NLS region, and is referred to
as the HSF domain.

HSFDOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
heat shock factor domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
around the centre of the domain, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the well-conserved
region encoded by PROSITE pattern HSF_DOMAIN (PS00434). Two iterations on
OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
containing 21 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 35 sequences.
