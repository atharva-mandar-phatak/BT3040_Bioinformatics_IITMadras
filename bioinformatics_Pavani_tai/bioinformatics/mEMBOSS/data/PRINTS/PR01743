SSDNABINDING
The sequence-specific single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSDP) family is
thought to be involved in transciption regulation. SSDP specifically binds
single-stranded pyrimidine-rich mirror repeat elements commonly found in
promoter regions, and is believed to regulate alpha-2(I) collagen [1]. It
has been identified as a target for unbalanced translocations and deletions
in acute myelogenous leukemia cells, implying a role as a tumour suppressor
gene [2]. It is expressed in spleen, lymph node, peripheral blood, bone
marrow, thymus and foetal liver [2]. Family members have been identified in
chicken, human, rat, mouse and Drosophila. The highest sequence identity is
observed in the first 100 N-terminal residues, which contains a tryptophan-
rich region in its centre. The C-terminus is more viariable, with glycine/
proline-rich low complexity regions.

SSDNABINDING is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
single-strand DNA-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the conserved
N-terminal region. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q9P038, a human protein
that lacks the N-terminal residues characteristic of other family members.
