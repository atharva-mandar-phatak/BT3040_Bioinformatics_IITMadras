ACCCTRFRASEA
Fatty acid synthesis involves a set of reactions, commencing with 
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA [1]. This is an irreversible
reaction, catalysed by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (EC 6.4.1.2); a
heterohexamer of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase and two
non-identical carboxyl transferase subunits (alpha and beta) in a 2:2
association [1,2]. 

The reaction involves two steps: 

(1) Biotin carrier protein + ATP + HCO(3)(-) <=>
	    Carboxybiotin carrier protein + ADP + Phosphate

(2) Carboxybiotin carrier protein + Acetyl-CoA ->
	    Malonyl-CoA + Biotin carrier protein

In the first step, biotin carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of the
carrier protein to form an intermediate. Next, the transcarboxylase complex
transfers the carboxyl group from the intermediate to acetyl-CoA forming
malonyl-CoA.

ACCCTRFRASEA is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
acetyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl transferase alpha subunit. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions within the N-terminal and central portions of the
alignment - motif 1 lies within a potential acyl-CoA binding domain. Two
iterations on OWL31.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 17 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences.
