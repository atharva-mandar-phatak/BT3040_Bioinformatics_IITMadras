MTUNCOUPLING
The brown fat uncoupling protein (UCP) dissipates oxidative energy into heat
by transporting protons from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix [1].
UCP functions as a dimer, forming a proton channel that leads to uncoupling
of oxidative phosphorylation by dissipation of the electrochemical potential
across the inner membrane.

The protein has a tripartite structure, with 3 similar ~100 residue domains.
The domains exhibit striking conservation of several residues, especially
of glycine and proline, which may constitute structurally strategic
positions [2]. The protein is thought to contain 6 transmembrane helices
[3]. These characteristics are shared by the ADP/ATP carrier protein, which
is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. 

MTUNCOUPLING is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 lies in
the first putative TM region; motif 2 spans part of the fifth putative
TM region; and motif 6 lies at the C-terminal extremity, in the purine
nucleotide binding domain. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was
identified.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
