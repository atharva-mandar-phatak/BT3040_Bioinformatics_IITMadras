IGFBPFAMILY4
Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)-I and -II are small secreted peptides 
that stimulate the survival, and promote the proliferation and 
differentiation, of many cell types [1]. In biological fluids, these growth
factors are usually bound to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which regulate
their availability and activity by prolonging their half-life and 
modulating their receptor interactions.

To date, six IGFBP family members have been identified (termed IGFBP1-6)
[2]. They share a conserved gene (intron-exon) organisation and high IGF
binding affinity. Structurally, the proteins also share a common domain 
architecture, possessing a conserved N-terminal IGFBP domain, a highly 
variable mid-section, and a thyroglobulin type-1 (Tg1) domain in their 
C-terminal regions.

In addition to their role in the regulation of IGF activity, there is 
evidence for the direct association of IGFBPs with a variety of 
extracellular and cell surface molecules [3,4], with consequent effects 
upon important biological processes. These include modulation of bone cell
proliferation [5], and growth arrest of breast and prostate cancer cells 
[3,6].

IGFBP4 is abundant in serum, and is expressed in many different tissues. The
protein functions as a cardiogenic growth factor in mice - an effect that
is IGF-independent, and mediated by inhibition on the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway [7]. 

IGFBPFAMILY4 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on
those sections that characterise IGFBP4 but distinguish it from other 
family members - motif 1 resides within the IGFBP domain; motif 2 lies 
between the IGFBP and Tg1 domains; and motif 3 resides within the Tg1 
domain. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also found, B4E351_HUMAN, a translated human cDNA 
sequence that fails to match motif 1.
