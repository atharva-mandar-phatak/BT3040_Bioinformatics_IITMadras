TMFOUR
A number of eukaryotic cell surface antigens have been shown to be related
[1], including mammalian leukocyte antigen CD37, mammalian lysosomal 
membrane protein CD63, human tumour-associated antigen CD-029, and several
others. These proteins are all type II membrane proteins: they contain an
N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain, which acts both as a signal sequence
and a membrane anchor, and 3 additional TM regions (hence the name 'TM4').
The sequences contain a number of conserved cysteine residues. 

TMFOUR is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
TM4 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 8
sequences: the motifs were drawn largely from the TM domains, motifs 2 and
3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE pattern TM4 (PS00421), which 
encompasses the intervening loop. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 20 sequences was
identified. A single partial match (B35826) was also found, a fragment
lacking part of TM domain 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 47 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
