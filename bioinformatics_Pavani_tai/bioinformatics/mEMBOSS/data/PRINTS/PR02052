ABRAXAS
Members of protein family FAM175 include the BRCA1-A complex subunit 
Abraxas [1,2], BRISC complex subunit Abro1 (Abraxas brother protein 1)
[3,4], and an uncharacterised protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

It is thought that BRCA1-A complex subunit Abraxas acts as a central
scaffold protein responsible for assembling the various components of the
BRCA1-A complex, and mediates recruitment of BRCA1 [1,2]. Its primary
sequence contains an MPN-like domain [4], and shares strong resemblance
in this region with an uncharacterised Arabidopsis protein.

ABRAXAS is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
BRCA1-A complex subunit Abraxas. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections 
that characterise Abraxas sequences but distinguish them from the rest of 
protein family FAM175. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f was required 
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. Two partial matches were also found, Q4R9B8_MACFA and
Q4SYF3_TETNG, both of which are presumed family members that fail to make
significant matches with one or more motifs.
