GLUTELIN
Glutelins are major storage proteins that aggregate in protein bodies in 
the endosperm of maize [1,2]. They comprise the second largest protein 
fraction in maize endosperm [2] (zeins being the largest), and show 
sequence similarities to other cereal storage proteins, such as gliadins, 
glutenins, hordeins, etc.. Glutelins have a well-defined structure, 
including an N-terminal region containing varying numbers of repeats of 
the sequence PPPHVL [1]; a Gln rich region that can be separated into 2 
domains; and a Cys rich C-terminal domain that shows some regions of 
internal similarity. Glutelins have been shown [2] to exhibit structural 
similarity to other cereal storage proteins, including a beta-reverse 
turn region which forms a loose helix-like domain.

GLUTELIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
glutelins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL18.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was 
identified.

An update on SPTR57.15_40.15f identified a true set of 14 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
