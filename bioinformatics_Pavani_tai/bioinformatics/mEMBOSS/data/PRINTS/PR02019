AQUAPORIN7
Aquaporins form water-specific channels that provide the plasma membranes 
of red cells and kidney proximal tubules with high permeability to water,
thereby permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient.
Aquaporin amino acid sequences contain two tandem repeats, each containing
three transmembrane (TM) domains and a pore-forming loop, with the signature
motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).

Aquaporin-7 (AQP7) forms a channel for water, glycerol and urea. It is
possible that testis-specific glycerol kinase and AQP7 are functionally
coupled, and that the major function of AQP7 is glycerol transport rather
than water transport. It may have an important role in spermatogenesis [1]
and possibly in fertilisation. It is mercury-resistant. It is also found in 
oocytes in some species [2], and thus may be generally connected with
gamete production.

AQUAPORIN7 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
aquaporin-7. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length - motif 1 resides at the end of the cytoplasmic N-terminal
region; motifs 2-4 span the extracellular domain between TM regions 1 and 2;
motif 5 resides within TM domain 3; motifs 6 and 7 lie in the extracellular
domain between TM domains 3 and 4; motif 8 lies in the fourth TM domain; 
and motif 9 resides in TM domain 6. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7
sequences was identified. Eleven partial matches were also found, 10 of 
which are fragments or family members that fail to make significant matches
with one or more motifs; the other, Q67EP9_SPAAU, is an unclassified 
aquaporin from Sparus aurata, which matches motifs 3 and 6.
