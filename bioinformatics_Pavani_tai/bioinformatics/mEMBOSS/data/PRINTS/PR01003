FLGFLIH
Many flagellar proteins are exported by a flagellum-specific export pathway. 
Attempts have been made to characterise the apparatus responsible for this
process, by designing assays to screen for mutants with export defects [1].
Experiments involving filament removal from temperature-sensitive flagellar
mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have shown that, while most mutants were 
able to regrow filaments, flhA, fliH, fliI and fliN mutants showed no or 
greatly reduced regrowth [1]. This suggests that the corresponding gene 
products are involved in the process of flagellum-specific export [1]. The
sequence of fliH has been deduced and shown to encode a protein of molecular
mass of 25,782 Da.

FLGFLIH is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for flagellar
assembly protein FliH. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
