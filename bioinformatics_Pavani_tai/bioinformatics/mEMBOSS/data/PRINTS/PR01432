RABAPTIN
Regeneration of injured axons at neuromuscular junctions has been assumed
to be regulated by extra-cellular factors that promote neurite outgrowth.
A novel neurite outgrowth factor from chick denervated skeletal muscle has 
been cloned and characterised. The protein, termed neurocrescin (rabaptin),
has been shown to be secreted in an activity-dependent fashion [1].

Rabaptin is a 100kDa coiled-coil protein that interacts with the GTP form
of the small GTPase Rab5, a potent regulator of endocytic transport [2]. It
is mainly cytosolic, but a fraction co-localises with Rab5 to early 
endosomes [2]. Rab5 recruits rabaptin-5 to purified early endosomes in a
GTP-dependent manner, demonstrating functional similarities with other
members of the Ras superfamily [2]. Immunodepletion of rabaptin-5 from 
cytosol strongly inhibits Rab5-dependent early endosome fusion. Thus, 
rabaptin-5 is a Rab effector required for membrane docking and fusion [2].

RABAPTIN is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
rabaptins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn largely from hydrophobic segments spanning
virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR39_14f was 
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond
the starting set. A single partial match was found, Q62835, a fos-related 
antigen from Rattus norvegicus that matches motifs 2, 3, 8 and 11.
