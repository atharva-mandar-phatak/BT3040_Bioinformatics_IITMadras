AMINEOXDASEF
Monoamine oxidases (MAO) A and B are encoded by two genes derived from
a common ancestral gene [1]. The enzymes catalyse the oxidative deamination
of biogenic and xenobiotic amines and have important roles in the metabolism
of neuroactive and vasoactive amines in the central nervous system and
peripheral tissues [2]. MAO-A preferentially oxidises biogenic amines such
as 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. MAO-A deficiency
has been linked to Brunner's syndrome, a form of X-linked nondysmorphic
mild mental retardation [2].

The protein contains two similarly-sized subunits, one of which contains
covalently-bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The FAD binding site
lies near the C-terminus; at the N-terminus are features characteristic
of the ADP-binding fold, suggesting that this region is also involved in
FAD binding [2]. The A and B forms of the enzyme share 70% sequence identity;
both contain the pentapeptide Ser-Gly-Gly-Cys-Tyr, the cysteine of which
binds FAD [3].

AMINEOXDASEF is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
flavin-containing amine oxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 lies in the
N-terminal putative nucleotide-binding region; and motif 6 contains the
conserved C-terminal pentapeptide, the cysteine of which binds the FAD
cofactor. A single iteration on OWL29.4 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are fragments and related
oxidases that fail to match one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
