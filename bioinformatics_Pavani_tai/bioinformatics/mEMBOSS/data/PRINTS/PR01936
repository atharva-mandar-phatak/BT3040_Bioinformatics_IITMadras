INTRLEUKIN22
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) belongs to the family of IL-10-related cytokines, 
which includes IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [1]. It is produced by 
activated T cells and acts as a T cell mediator, promoting the innate, 
non-specific immunity of tissues [2]. IL-22 also regulates early defense 
mechanisms against attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens [3].

INTRLEUKIN22 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-22. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length - motifs 2, 3, 6 and 7 encompass short regions of
helix, and motifs 4 and 5 each span a beta turn. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9
sequences was identified.
