MPIPHPHTASE
M-phase inducer phosphatases function as dosage-dependent inducers in
mitotic control [1-4]. They are tyrosine protein phosphatases required for
progression of the cell cycle. They may directly dephosphorylate p34(cdc2)
and activate p34(cdc2) kinase activity. They catalyse the reaction:
protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein tyrosine + orthophosphate.

MPIPHPHTASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for M-phase
inducer phosphatases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motif 4 includes the active
site cysteine. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 18 sequences was identified. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are family members that fail
to make significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
