HISTONEH3
Histone H3 is a small, highly conserved nuclear protein that, together
with 2 molecules each of histones H2A, H2B and H4, forms the eukaryotic
nucleosome core [1]; the nucleosome octamer winds ~146 DNA base-pairs.

Several proteins have been found to contain a C-terminal H3-like domain,
including the mammalian centromeric protein CENP-A (which may act as a core
histone necessary for the assembly of centromeres) [2]; yeast chromatin-
associated protein CSE4 [3]; and C.elegans chromosome III proteins 
YL82_CAEEL and YMH3_CAEEL, whose function is unknown.

HISTONEH3 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H3 histones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 16
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 span the N-terminal region
encoded by PROSITE pattern HISTONE_H3_1 (PS00322), and motif 4 includes
the central region encoded by PROSITE pattern HISTONE_H3_2 (PS00959). Two
iterations on OWL29.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 51 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found: these include the histone H3-related sequences (CSE4_YEAST,
CENA_HUMAN, CENA_BOVIN, YMH3_CAEEL and YL82_CAEEL) and various fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 46 sequences, and 16
partial matches.
