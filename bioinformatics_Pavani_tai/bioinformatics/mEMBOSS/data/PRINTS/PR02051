PROTEINF175
Members of protein family FAM175 include the BRCA1-A complex subunit 
Abraxas [1,2], BRISC complex subunit Abro1 (Abraxas brother protein 1)
[3,4], and an uncharacterised protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

It is thought that BRCA1-A complex subunit Abraxas acts as a central
scaffold protein responsible for assembling the various components of the
BRCA1-A complex, and mediates recruitment of BRCA1 [1,2]. Similarly, Abro1
probably acts as a scaffold facilitating assembly of the various components
of BRISC [3] - the protein does not interact with BRCA1, but binds
polyubiquitin [4]. The primary sequences of these proteins contain an 
MPN-like domain [4], and share strong resemblance in this region with an 
uncharacterised Arabidopsis protein.

PROTEINF175 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
protein family FAM175. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 19 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
largely spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment - motifs 1-4 span 
the MPN-like domain. Three iterations on SPTR57.15_40.15f were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 21 sequences
was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
presumed family members that fail to make significant matches with one or
more motifs.
