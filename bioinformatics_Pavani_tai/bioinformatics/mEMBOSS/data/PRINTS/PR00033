HTHASNC
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family includes the E.coli asnC and leucine-responsive
regulatory proteins [1], and the Streptomyces glycerol operon regulatory
protein [2]. The HTH motif in each of these proteins is situated towards
the N-terminus.

HTHASNC is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of the asnC bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs completely
encompass the HTH motif and extend slightly beyond it in both N- and C-
terminal directions, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern HTH_ASNC_FAMILY (PS00519). A single iteration on OWL21.1 was
required to reach convergence, no new sequences being identified beyond
the starting set. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 36 sequences, and 13
partial matches.
