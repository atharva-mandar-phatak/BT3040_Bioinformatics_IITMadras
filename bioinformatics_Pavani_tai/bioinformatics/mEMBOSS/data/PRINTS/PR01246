RAD1REPAIR
The rad1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe comprises three exons and encodes
a 37kDa protein that exhibits partial similarity to the REC1 gene of 
Ustilago maydis [2]. The two genes share putative functional similarities
in their respective organisms. 

RAD1REPAIR is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Rad1 DNA
repair proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise the
Rad1 proteins but distinguish them from members of the related Rec1 family.
A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
