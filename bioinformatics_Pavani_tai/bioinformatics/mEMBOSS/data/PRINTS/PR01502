UXTPROTEIN
The human Xp11 region is extremely gene rich and of great interest
biologically due to the large number of disease loci found there. Disease-
related genes found in this regions are involved in Norrie disease,
retinitis pigmentosa, synovial sarcoma, syndromic and nonsyndromic mental
retardation, Renpennning syndrome, Prieto syndrome and Sutherland-Hann
syndrome. A number of oncogenes are also found here.

A novel gene was identified in the Xp11 region via exon-trapping
experiments. Northern analysis revealed no apparent splice variants, and
significant expression in all tissues tested. The gene was thus named
ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT). UXT does not share significant 
sequence similarity with any known genes. However, a search of dbEST 
indicated widespread expression in tumour tissue [1].

UXTPROTEIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
ubiquitously expressed transcript protein. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on
SPTR39_14f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.
