RIBTRNSFRASE
Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in 
which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to proteins; this process
is responsible for the toxicity of some bacterial toxins (e.g., cholera and
pertussis toxins) [1]. A family of mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases exists in
vertebrates that transfer ADP-ribose to arginine [1]:

	NAD(+) + L-arginine = nicotinamide + N2-(ADP-D-ribosyl)-L-arginine

At least five forms of the enzyme have been characterised to date, some
of which are attached to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchors, while others appear to be secreted. The enzymes contain ~250-300 
residues, which encode putative signal sequences and carbohydrate attachment
sites. In addition, the N- and C-termini are predominantly hydrophobic, a
characteristic of GPI-anchored proteins [2].

RIBTRNSFRASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
ADP-ribosyltransferases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 4 includes
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern ART (PS01291); and motif 7 includes
the active site glutamate. Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18 sequences was 
identified. Three partial matches were also found, all of which are 
fragments or homologues that fail to match one or more motifs. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 1
partial match.
