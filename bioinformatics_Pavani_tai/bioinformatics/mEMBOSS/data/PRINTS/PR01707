56KDTSANTIGN
A variety of exotic diseases are caused by bacteria from the order 
Rickettsiales, such as spotted fever, typhus and scrub typhus, and Q fever 
[1]. Infections by the obligate intracellular pathogens are usually 
characterised by fever, rash, pneumonia, myocarditis and intravascular 
coagulation [1]. Serological tests are most commonly used to discriminate
between the closely related Rickettsia spp. that cause such symptoms [1]. 

Rickettsia (Orienta) tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of scrub typhus, 
and is spread to the human host through an insect vector - Leptotrombidium
fuji or the trombiculid mite [2]. Several strains of the bacterium have 
been isolated, and each can be distinguished by the antigenic variation of 
the immunodominant 56kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) [3,4]. The TSA is a 
major virulence factor of O.tsutsugamushi, responsible for the recognition 
and uptake of the microbe into host macrophages [4]. 

More recently, the sequences of each TSA variant were used to type the 
different strains based on their similarities [5] - eight major Asian 
strains have been recognised to date. 

56KDTSANTIGN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Rickettsia 56kDa type-specific antigen family. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the C-terminal portion of the alignment - motif 2
encodes the N-terminus of a putative transmembrane domain. Two iterations on
SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 16 sequences was identified.
