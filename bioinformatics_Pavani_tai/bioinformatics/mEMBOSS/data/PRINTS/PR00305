1433ZETA
The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of related proteins found in mammalian
brain cells, preferentially in neurons, although similar proteins have been
identified in all eukaryotic species studied to date. They are homodimeric,
acidic proteins [1] with multiple biological activities: they act as
protein kinase-dependent activators of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxy-
lases, key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of neurotransmitters such
as dopamine and serotonin; some act as inhibitors of protein kinase C; and 
some display phospholipase A2 activity on choline and ethanolamine glycero-
phospholipids [1-3]. In yeast, a 14-3-3-like protein is involved in growth
regulation. Although the proteins have different biological functions, their
sequences are well conserved.

1433ZETA is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 14-3-3
zeta proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motifs 1 and 6 including the perfectly conserved
regions encoded by PROSITE patterns 1433_1 (PS00796) and 1433_2 (PS00797).
Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 37 sequences was identified. Eight partial
matches were also found, all of which are 14-3-3 protein fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 92 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
