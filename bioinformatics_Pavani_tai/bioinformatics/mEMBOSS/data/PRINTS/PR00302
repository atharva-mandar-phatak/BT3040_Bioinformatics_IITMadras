LUPUSLA
The La protein is a 47kDa polypeptide that often acts as an autoantigen
in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome patients [1]. A
vital property of the protein is its association with the U-rich termini
of newly-synthesised RNA polymerase III transcripts. A 32kDa yeast
protein shows similarity to the N-termini of vertebrate La proteins, 
and also preferentially binds U-rich RNAs [2].

LUPUSLA is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
lupus La proteins and the related La protein homologue. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were
drawn from conserved regions in the N-terminal region of the alignment,
motifs 4 and 5 each including an RNA-binding region (cf. PROSITE pattern
RNP_1 (PS00030)). Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences.
