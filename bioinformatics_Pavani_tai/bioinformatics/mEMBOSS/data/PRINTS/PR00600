PP2APR55
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase implicated 
in many cellular processes, including the regulation of metabolic enzymes 
and proteins involved in signal transduction [1,2]. PP2A is a trimer
composed of a 36kDa catalytic subunit, a 65kDa regulatory subunit 
(subunit A) and a variable third subunit (subunit B) [1,2]. 

One form of the third subunit is a 55kDa protein (PR55), which exists in
Drosophila and yeast, and has up to 3 forms in mammals [1,2]. PR55 may act
as a substrate recognition unit, or may help to target the enzyme to the
correct subcellular location [1]. The small and middle T-antigens of polyoma
virus have also been shown to associate with the catalytic and 65kDa PP2A
subunits, apparently substituting for PR55. Surprisingly, little sequence
similarity can be identified between the 2 proteins [2].

PP2APR55 is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
PP2A PR55 regulatory subunit. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from virtually the full
alignment length, motifs 2 and 4 containing the regions encoded by PROSITE 
patterns PR55_1 (PS01024) and PR55_2 (PS01025). Two iterations on OWL27.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 15
sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also found, all PR55 
subunit fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences.
