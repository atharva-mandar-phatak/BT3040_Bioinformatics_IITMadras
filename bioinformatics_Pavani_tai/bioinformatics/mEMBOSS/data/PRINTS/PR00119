CATATPASE
P-type (or E1-E2-type) ATPases constitute a superfamily of cation transport 
enzymes, present both in prokaryota and eukaryota, whose members mediate 
membrane flux of all common biologically relevant cations [1]. The enzymes
can be divided into 4 major groups [2]: (1) Ca2+-transporting ATPases;
(2) Na+/K+- and gastric H+/K+-transporting ATPases; (3) plasma membrane
H+-transporting ATPases (proton pumps) of plants, fungi and lower
eukaryotes; and (4) all bacterial P-type ATPases, except the Mg2+-ATPase
of S.typhimurium, which is more similar to the eukaryotic sequences.

CATATPASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
superfamily of cation-transporting ATPases. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 18 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
regions that are well-conserved throughout the superfamily, motif 2
including residues in the vicinity of a phosphorylated aspartate (cf.
PROSITE pattern ATPASE_E1_E2 (PS00154)). Two iterations on OWL19.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 93
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found,
including several fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 217 sequences, and 94
partial matches.
