STROIDFINGER
Steroid hormone receptors act as transcription factors that regulate gene 
expression, either positively or negatively, by interacting with cellular 
DNA sequences called ligand responsive elements [1]. This process involves
binding of the steroid hormone ligand to its receptor, which results in
receptor dimerisation prior to DNA binding via 4 zinc finger loops [2].
Recognition of specific ligand responsive elements is determined by a small
number of amino acids in the 'knuckle' of the finger [1]. Unlike other
transcription factors, which contain multiple tandem repeats of a zinc
finger that binds zinc via 2 conserved Cys and 2 conserved His residues,
each steroid hormone receptor contains only 2 repeats of a finger that
binds zinc via 4 conserved cysteines.

STROIDFINGER is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
C4-type DNA-binding zinc fingers. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 14 sequences: the motifs encompass both fingers,
motifs 1 and 2 spanning the 27 residues encoded by PROSITE pattern 
STEROID_FINGER (PS00031), which lie in the first finger motif. Two 
iterations on OWL20.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point 
a true set comprising 140 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, 2 of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 466 sequences, and 75
partial matches.
