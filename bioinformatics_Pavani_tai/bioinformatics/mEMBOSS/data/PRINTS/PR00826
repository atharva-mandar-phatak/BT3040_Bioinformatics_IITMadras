FANCONIAGENE
Fanconi anaemia (FA) [1-3] is a recessive inherited disease characterised by
defective DNA repair. FA cells are sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents
that cause chromosomal instability and cell death. The disease is manifested
clinically by progressive pancytopenia, variable physical anomalies, and
predisposition to malignancy [3]. Four complementation groups have been
identified, designated A to D. The FA group A gene (FAA) has been
cloned [4], but its function remains to be elucidated. 

FANCONIAGENE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the Fanconi anaemia group A gene product. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
the C-terminal portion of the alignment, and include regions known to
contain disease-inducing mutation sites. A single iteration on OWL30.0
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on OWL31_3 identified a true set of 3 sequences.
