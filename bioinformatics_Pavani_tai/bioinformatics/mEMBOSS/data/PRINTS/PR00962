LETHAL2GIANT
The lethal(2)giant larvae tumour-suppressor gene of Drosophila controls cell
proliferation and/or differentiation in the optic centres of the brain and
the imaginal discs [1]. The structure of the l(2)gl genes, determined by
sequencing genomic and cDNA clones, indicates the use of alternative
splicing, either in the 5' untranslated or 3' coding exons [1]. The gene
thus encodes two putative proteins, p127 and p78, differing at their
C-termini [1]. A 3'-truncated l(2)gl transposon that leaves the coding
sequence of p78 intact, but deletes 141 residues of p127, was capable
of suppressing tumour formation in l(2)gl-deficient animals [1]. 

Mutations in the Drosophila l(2)gl gene cause malignant transformation of
the optic centres of the larval brain and imaginal discs. The l(2)gl gene
from Drosophila pseudoobscura shows a high degree of conservation with the
corresponding protein-coding domain from D.melanogaster [2]. 

LETHAL2GIANT is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for lethal(2)
giant larvae proteins (P127). The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 5 and 7 include short
internal repeats (LIVGGTAGQIVIADF and LVSGGTAHGLVLFDF respectively in 
D.melanogaster). Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
