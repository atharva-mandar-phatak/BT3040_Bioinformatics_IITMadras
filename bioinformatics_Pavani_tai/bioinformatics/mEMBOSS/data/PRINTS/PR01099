HYETHTZKNASE
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a required cofactor for many enzymes in the 
cell, is synthesised de novo in Salmonella typhimurium [1]. Five kinase 
activities have been implicated in TPP synthesis, which involves joining 
a 4-methyl-5-(beta-hydroxyethyl)thiazole (THZ) moiety and a 4-amino-5-
hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) moiety [1,2]. 

THZ kinase (EC 2.7.1.50) activity is involved in the salvage synthesis of 
TH-P from the thiazole: 

2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate      pyrophosphate
			+ 			    =		     +
4-4-methyl-5-(2-phosphonooxyethyl)-thiazole 	  thiamin monophosphate

Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase expression is regulated at the mRNA level by
intracellular thiamin pyrophosphate [2].

HYETHTZKNASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hydroxyethylthiazole kinase family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on 
OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 8 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences.
