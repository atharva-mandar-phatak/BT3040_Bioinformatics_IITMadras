CELLSNTHASED
An operon encoding 4 proteins required for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis
(bcs) in Acetobacter xylinum has been isolated via genetic complementation
with strains lacking cellulose synthase activity [1]. Nucleotide sequence
analysis showed the cellulose synthase operon to consist of 4 genes, 
designated bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD [1], all of which are required for 
maximal bacterial cellulose synthesis in A.xylinum [1]. 

The calculated molecular mass of the protein encoded by bcsD is 17.3kDa [1].
The function of BcsD is unknown. 

CELLSNTHASED is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
cellulose synthase subunit D. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR39_14f were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 
sequences was identified.
