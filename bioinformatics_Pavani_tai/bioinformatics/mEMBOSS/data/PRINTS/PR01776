HPOMPFAMILY
Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes constitute a semi-permeable, size-
dependent permeability barrier, for example to hydrolytic enzymes, 
detergents, dyes and hydrophobic anti-microbials. The outer membrane
protein (OMP) profile of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) differs from that of other
Gram-negative bacteria, where the highly non-selective porins are absent and
a number of less abundant protein species are observed [1]. OMPs from Hp 
have been identified as porins, gastric epithelial cell adhesins and Lewis B
binding adhesins [2,3]. Extensive C-terminal sequence similarity between
these OMPs has been used to define a much larger paralogous family.

Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent of gastritis and peptic
ulceration in humans. Numerous subtypes of OMPs have been identified in
Hp. Attempts have been made to construct recombinant vectors that are able
to express these OMPs in order to develop a vaccine protecting against
Hp infection and a diagnostic reagent kit to quickly detect Hp infection
[4]. OMPs were chosen as possible targets of vaccine development as they are
Hp specific, surface exposed and highly antigenic.

HPOMPFAMILY is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Helicobacter pylori outer membrane protein family. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the C-terminal portion of the alignment. Six
iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 67 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are H.pylori hypothetical and putative OMPs
that fail to make significant matches with one or more motifs.
