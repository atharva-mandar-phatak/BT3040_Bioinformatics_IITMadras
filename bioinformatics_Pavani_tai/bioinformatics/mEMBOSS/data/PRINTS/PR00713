CNATPEPTIDE
Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) are vertebrate hormones that play an
important role in the control of cardiovascular homeostatis, and sodium
and water balance in general [1-3]. There are different NPs that vary in
length but share a common core. All are processed from a single precursor.
A disulphide bond resident in the C-terminal section is required for full
activity of atriopeptins.

The family of NPs includes structurally-related peptides that elicit 
similar pharmacological spectra: amongst these are brain natriuretic
peptide (BNP); C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP); ventricular natriuretic
peptide (VNP) [4]; and green mamba natriuretic peptide (DNP) [5]. 

CNATPEPTIDE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
C-type natriuretic peptides. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the C-terminal region,
motif 3 spanning the section encoded by PROSITE pattern NATRIURETIC_PEPTIDE
(PS00263), which includes the two functionally important cysteines and two
conserved glycines, which may be important for the conformation of the
peptides. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also found, D85843, a natriuretic peptide homologue that
fails to make a significant match with motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 1
partial match.
