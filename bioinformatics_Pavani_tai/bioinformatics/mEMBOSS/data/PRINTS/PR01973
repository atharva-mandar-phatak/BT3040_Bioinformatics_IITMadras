TNFACTORR27
The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more
than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on
similarity in their extracellular domain - a region that contains many
cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [1]. The
cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for
ligand binding [2].

Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are
assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their
intracellular domains and sequences [3]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore
induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation,
differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the
receptor involved [4,5].

TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial
biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and
adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [3]. Drugs that
manipulate their signalling have potential roles in the prevention and
treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart
disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [6].

TNF receptor 27 (also known as ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) and
ectodysplasin receptor, x-linked (XEDAR)) is highly expressed during
embryogenesis [7], and has been implicated in the development of ectodermal 
appendages, such as hair follicles, teeth and sweat glands [8]. Although it
lacks a death domain, the receptor can nevertheless induce cell death via 
activation of caspase 8, and may play a role in the induction of apoptosis 
during embryonic development and adult life [7].

TNFACTORR27 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for tumour
necrosis factor receptor 27. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections
that characterise TNF receptor 27 but distinguish it from other TNF receptor
subtypes - motif 1 lies in the extracellular N-terminal region, and motifs
2 and 3 reside within the intracellular C-terminal region. Two iterations on
SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 5 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also
found, B4DQY6_HUMAN, a translated human cDNA sequence that fails to match
motif 1.
