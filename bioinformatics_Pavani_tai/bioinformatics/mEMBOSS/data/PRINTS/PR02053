BRISCABRO1
Members of protein family FAM175 include the BRCA1-A complex subunit 
Abraxas [1,2], BRISC complex subunit Abro1 (Abraxas brother protein 1)
[3,4], and an uncharacterised protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

It is thought that Abro1 acts as a central scaffold protein facilitating
assembly of the various components of BRISC [3] - the protein does not
interact with BRCA1, but binds polyubiquitin [4]. Its primary sequence
contains an MPN-like domain [4], and shares strong resemblance in this
region with an uncharacterised Arabidopsis protein.

BRISCABRO1 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
BRISC complex subunit Abro1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections 
that characterise Abro1 sequences but distinguish them from the rest of 
protein family FAM175. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f was required 
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. Two partial matches were also found, Q641B1_XENLA and
Q6NWD2_DANRE, both of which are presumed family members that fail to make
significant matches with motifs 1-4.
