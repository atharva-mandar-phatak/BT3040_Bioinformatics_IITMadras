BCTERIALGSPD
The general (type II) secretion pathway (GSP) within Gram-negative bacteria
is a signal sequence-dependent process repsonsible for protein export [1-3].
The process has two stages: exoproteins are first translocated across the
inner membrane by the general signal-dependent export pathway (GEP), and 
then across the outer membrane by a species-specific accessory mechanism. 

A number of proteins are involved in the GSP; one of these is known as 
protein D (GSPD protein), the most probable location of which is the outer
membrane [4]. This suggests that protein D constitutes the apparatus of the 
accessory mechanism, and is thus involved in transporting exoproteins from
the periplasm, across the outer membrane, to the extracellular environment.

BCTERIALGSPD is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
general secretion pathway protein D. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions within the C-terminal portion of the alignment - motif 4 includes
part of the region encoded by PROSITE pattern T2SP_D (PS00875), which
includes two conserved proline residues. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found: those
matching 3 motifs are related gene IV and fimbrial assembly proteins, most
of which match motifs 1, 2 and 4; those matching 2 motifs are related
secretion proteins. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 19 sequences, and 18
partial matches.
