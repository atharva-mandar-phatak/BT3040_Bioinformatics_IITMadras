PROTEINF25
A small, approximately 90-residue amino acid polypeptide, designated protein
FAM25, has been identified in human and mouse. Its function is currently
unknown.

PROTEINF25 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
protein family FAM25. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment 
of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set. A single partial match was found, F25DE_HUMAN, a closely
related sequence bearing a dissimilar N-terminal extension that fails to
match motif 1.
