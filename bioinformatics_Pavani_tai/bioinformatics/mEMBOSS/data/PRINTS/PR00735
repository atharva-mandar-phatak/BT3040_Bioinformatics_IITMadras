GLHYDRLASE8
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 8 includes mostly endoglucanases, which are essential
enzymes for microbial degradation of cellulose and xylans. 

GLHYDRLASE8 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 8 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 2 includes the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F8 (PS00812), the first 
aspartate of which is thought to act as the nucleophile in the catalytic
mechanism [5]. A single iteration on OWL29.3 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
Several partial matches were found, all of which are family members that
fail to make significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
