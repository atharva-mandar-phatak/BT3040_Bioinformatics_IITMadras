SOMATOMEDINB
Somatomedin B, a serum factor of unknown function, is a 45-residue,
cysteine-rich peptide, derived proteolytically from the N-terminus of the
cell-substrate adhesion protein vitronectin [1]. Cys-rich somatomedin
B-like domains [2] are found in a number of proteins, including plasma-
cell membrane glycoprotein (which has nucleotide pyrophosphate and
alkaline phosphodiesterase I activities) [3] and placental protein 11 [4] 
(which appears to possess amidolytic activity).

SOMATOMEDINB is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
somatomedin B-like domains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs include 8 conserved Cys residues,
motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE pattern SOMATOMEDIN_B 
(PS00524). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
