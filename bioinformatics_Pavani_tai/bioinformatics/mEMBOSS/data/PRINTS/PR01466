ARGDEIMINASE
The arginine dihydrolase (AD) pathway is found in many prokaryotes and some
primitive eukaryotes, an example of the latter being Giardia [1}. The three- 
enzyme anaerobic pathway breaks down L-arginine to form 1 mol of ATP, carbon 
dioxide and ammonia. In simpler bacteria, the first enzyme, arginine 
deiminase, can account for up to 10% of total cell protein [1].

Arginine deiminase catalyses the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline
and ammonia. As well as producing energy via ATP, the ammonia also serves
to protect the bacteria against acid damage, and the citrulline generated
can be used in other biosynthetic pathways [2]. A streptococcal acid 
glycoprotein (SAGP) has also been shown to function as an arginine
deiminase [3].

Recently, another function of this enzyme has been discovered [4]. It has a 
potent anti-tumour effect, and can inhibit antigen, superantigen, or mitogen
-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation [4]. 
Another function of the protein may be to inhibit cell proliferation by 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. It has thus been hypothesised 
that recombinant arginine deiminase could be used as a novel anti-tumour 
agent [4].

ARGDEIMINASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
the bacterial arginine deiminase protein family. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~430 amino acids). Two
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point 
a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified. Three partial matches 
were also found: P75475 and P75474 are Mycoplasma pneumoniae arginine 
deiminases that match the first three and the last three motifs respectively;
and Q48294 is a Halobacterium salinarium arginine deiminase that matches
motifs 2 and 6.
