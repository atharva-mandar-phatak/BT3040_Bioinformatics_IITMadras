FLGFLGJ
The flgH, flgI and fliF genes of Salmonella typhimurium encode the major
proteins for the L, P and M rings of the flagellar basal body [1]. The
sequences of these and of the flgJ gene have been determined, and the amino
acid sequences of their products deduced [1]. 

The flgJ gene, lies immediately adjacent to flgI and is the last gene of the
flgB operon. It encodes a flagellar protein of unknown function, whose
deduced sequence is hydrophilic, and may correspond to a cytoplasmic 
protein [1]. Several aspects of the DNA sequence of these genes and their
surrounds suggest complex regulation of the flagellar gene system [1].

FLGFLGJ is a 13-element fingerprint that provides a signature for flagellar
flgJ proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
A single partial match was found, AF0192131, an flgI protein from Vibrio
cholerae that matches 5 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
