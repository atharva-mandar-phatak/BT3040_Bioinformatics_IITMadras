HTHLUXR
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family groups together a range of proteins, including
bvgA, comA, degU, fimZ, fixJ, gerE, lasR, luxR, malT, narL, nodW, rcsA,
sdiA and uhpA [1-3]. Although the sequences belonging to this family differ
somewhat in length, in each case the HTH motif is situated towards the 
C-terminus.

HTHLUXR is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of the luxR bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs completely
encompass the HTH motif, extending a few residues beyond both its N- and C-
termini (cf. PROSITE pattern HTH_LUXR_FAMILY (PS00622)). Three iterations
on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 46 sequences was identified. Six partial matches were also
found, some of which are simply fragments, while others lack significant
matches with motif 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 136 sequences, and 35
partial matches.
