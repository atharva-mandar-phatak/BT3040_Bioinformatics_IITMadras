PROTEINF153
Several distinct antigens (designated NY-REN-1 to NY-REN-65) that are
reactive with autologous IgG have been identified in renal cancer patients
[1]. Of these, renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-7 (also termed protein
FAM153) belongs to a small conserved family of proteins whose function is,
as yet, unknown.

PROTEINF153 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
protein family FAM153. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on
SPTR57.15_40.15f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set.
