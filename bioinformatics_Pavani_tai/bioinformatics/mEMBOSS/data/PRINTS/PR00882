RIBOSOMALL7A
The genomic structure and sequence of the human ribosomal protein L7a has
been determined [1]. The gene contains 8 exons and 7 introns, encompassing
3179 bp. The human gene resembles other mammalian ribosomal protein genes
in so far as it contains a short first exon, a short 5' untranslated leader
and its transcriptional start sites at C residues embedded in a poly-
pyrimidine tract [1].

The sequence of a gene for ribosomal protein L4 of S.cerevisiae has also 
been determined, which, unlike most of its other ribosomal protein genes,
has no intron [2]. The single open reading frame is highly similar to
mammalian ribosomal protein L7a. 

There appear to be two genes for L4, both of which are active [2]. Yeast
cells containing a disruption of the L4-1 gene form smaller colonies than
either wild-type or disrupted L4-2 strains. Disruption of both L4 genes is
lethal, probably resulting from an inability of the organism to produce
functional ribosomes. [3]

Several other ribosomal proteins have been found to share sequence 
similarity with L7a, including yeast NHP2 [4], B.subtilis hypothetical 
protein ylxQ, Halobacterium marismortui Hs6, and M.jannaschii MJ1203.

RIBOSOMALL7A is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the L7A family of ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved sections spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing
on those regions that characterise the ribosomal L7A proteins but
distinguish them from the rest of the HMG-like family. Two iterations
on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 14 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were
also found, both of which are fragments: RL7A_ARATH is an Arabidopsis L7A 
protein that matches motifs 1-5; and SSO4A09 is a porcine L7A protein
that matches motifs 4-6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences.
