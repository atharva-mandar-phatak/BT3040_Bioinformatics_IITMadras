CALCITONINA
The calcitonin (CT) gene is alternatively expressed in a tissue-specific
manner, producing either the calcium regulatory hormone CT in the thyroid,
or the neuropeptide calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the brain [1].
In medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, both peptides are produced [1]. 

The calcitonin regulatory hormone is a peptide of 32 residues that causes a
rapid but short-lived drop in calcium and phosphate levels in the blood by
promoting the incorporation of these ions in the bones [2]. The structure
of salmon calcitonin has been studied by 2D NMR in SDS micelles [3]. The
main conformational feature of the hormone is an alpha-helix from residues
6-22, which includes an amphipathic segment. Two cysteine residues (at 
positions 1 and 7) form an N-terminal loop, and a C-terminal decapeptide
forms a loop that folds back towards the helix [3]. 

CALCITONINA is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for alpha-
type calcitonin peptides. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs span the full length of the peptide -
motifs 1 and 2 span the alpha-helix, motif 1 also including the two Cys
residues known to be involved in disulphide bond formation [3] (these motifs
also include the region encoded by PROSITE pattern CALCITONIN (PS00258)); 
motif 3 encompasses the C-terminal loop. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, SYNCALAA,
a synthetic human calcitonin fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
