TEKTIN
Tektin heteropolymers form unique protofilaments of flagellar microtubules
[1]. The proteins are predicted to form extended rods composed of 2 alpha-
helical segments (~180 residues long) capable of forming coiled coils,
interrupted by non-helical linkers [1]. The 2 segments are similar in 
sequence, indicating a gene duplication event. Along each tektin rod, 
cysteine residues occur with a periodicity of ~8nm, coincident with the
axial repeat of tubulin dimers in microtubules [1]. It is proposed that
the assembly of tektin heteropolymers produces filaments with repeats of
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 96nm, generating the basis for the complex
spatial arrangements of axonemal components [1]. 

TEKTIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
tektins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions in the
C-terminal half (the second segment) of the alignment - motif 1 lies in
so-called segment 2B, and motifs 2-4 span segment 2C, motif 2 including a
conserved nonapeptide. A single iteration on OWL27.1 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on OWL31_3 identified a true set of 2 sequences, and 1
partial match.
