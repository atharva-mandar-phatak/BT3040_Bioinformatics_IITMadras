CD74ANTIGEN
The CD74 antigen (also known as H-2 class II histocompatibility antigen 
gamma chain, MHC class II-associated invariant chain, Ia antigen-associated
invariant chain, or Ii) plays a key role in MHC class II antigen processing:
it stabilises peptide-free class II alpha/beta heterodimers in a nonameric
(alpha-beta-gamma)3 complex after their synthesis, and directs transport of
the complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to compartments where peptide
loading of class II takes place [1]. 

CD74/Ii is a single-pass type II membrane protein containing a thyroglobulin
type-1 domain. The structure of the trimeric domain of the MHC class 
II-associated chaperonin and targeting protein Ii has been determined by
NMR [1]. The molecule is cylindrical in shape and reveals conserved
molecular surfaces that may mediate interactions between Ii and class II
molecules [1]. 

CD74ANTIGEN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H-2 class II histocompatibility antigen gamma chain (CD74 antigen). The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 12 sequences: the 
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length preceding the thyroglobulin type-1 domain. Two iterations
on SPTR55_38f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 14 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are homologues that fail to match 2 or more motifs.
