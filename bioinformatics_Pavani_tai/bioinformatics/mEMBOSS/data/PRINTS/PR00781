LIPOSIGPTASE
Bacterial cell walls contain large amounts of murein lipoprotein, a small 
protein that is both N-terminally bound to lipid and attached to membrane 
peptidoglycan (murein) through the epsilon-amino group of its C-terminal
lysine residue [1]. Secretion of this lipoprotein is facilitated by the
action of lipoprotein signal peptidase (also known as leader peptidase II),
located in the inner membrane [1,2]. The enzyme is inhibited by globomycin
and also by pepstatin, suggesting that it is an aspartic peptidase [1].
The catalytic residues have not been identified, but three conserved
aspartates can be identified from sequence alignments.

LIPOSIGPTASE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
lipoprotein signal peptidase family (A8) of aspartate endopeptidases. The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length - motif 2 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
SPASE_II (PS00855), which contains one of the conserved aspartate residues;
and motif 3 contains a second conserved Asp. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, LLU63724,
a fragment that lacks the region of sequence bearing motif 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 1
partial match.
