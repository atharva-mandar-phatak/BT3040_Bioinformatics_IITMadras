INTERLEUKIN3
Interleukin-3 (IL3) is a cytokine that regulates blood-cell production by 
controlling the production, differentiation and function of granulocytes
and macrophages [1,2]. The protein, which exists in vivo as a monomer, is
produced in activated T-cells and mast cells [1,2], and is activated by the
cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence [2].

IL3 is produced by T-lymphocytes and T-lymphomas only after stimulation
with antigens, mitogens, or chemical activators such as phorbol esters.
However, IL3 is constitutively expressed in the myelomonocytic leukaemia
cell line WEHI-3B [2]. It is thought that the genetic change of the cell
line to constitutive production of IL3 is the key event in development of
this leukaemia [2].

INTERLEUKIN3 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the interleukin-3 cytokines. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
12 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences.
