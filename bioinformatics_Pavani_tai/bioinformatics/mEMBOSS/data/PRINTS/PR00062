RIBOSOMALL20
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2].

L20 is a protein from the large (50S) subunit; in E.coli it is known to
bind directly to the 23S rRNA, and is required for ribosome assembly, but
does not take part in protein synthesis. It belongs to a family of ribosomal
proteins, including L20 from eubacteria, plant and alga chloroplasts and
cyanelles.

RIBOSOMALL20 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for L20
ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from virtually the full alignment
length, motif 2 including the central region encoded by PROSITE pattern
RIBOSOMAL_L20 (PS00937). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 33 sequences.
