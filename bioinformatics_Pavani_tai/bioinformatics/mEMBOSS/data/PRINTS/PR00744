GLHYDRLASE37
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). 

Family 37 encompasses trehalases. These enzymes are responsible for
degradation of the disaccharide alpha,alpha-trehalose, yielding two glucose
units [5]:
   		alpha,alpha-trehalose + H(2)O = 2 D-glucose

GLHYDRLASE37 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 37 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motif 6 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern TREHALASE_2(PS00928). Two iterations
on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 14 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also
found, all of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 19 sequences, and 1
partial match.
