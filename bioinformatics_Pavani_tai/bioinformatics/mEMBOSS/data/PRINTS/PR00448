NSFATTACHMNT
The 'secretory complex' comprises a family of conserved proteins, members
of which appear to function at all sites of constitutive and regulated
secretion in eukaryotes [1]. Among them are 2 types of cytosolic protein:
NSF (N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive protein) and the SNAPs (alpha-, beta- and
gamma-soluble NSF attachment proteins). The yeast vesicular fusion protein,
sec17, a cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein involved in vesicular
transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus, shows
a high degree of sequence similarity to the alpha-SNAP family.

NSFATTACHMNT is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for NSF
and sec17 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.3 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified. Three partial matches were also found: BI47_MOUSE is a
fragment lacking the first motif; and DHYC_ANTCR and DHYC_TRIGR are 
dynein beta chains.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
