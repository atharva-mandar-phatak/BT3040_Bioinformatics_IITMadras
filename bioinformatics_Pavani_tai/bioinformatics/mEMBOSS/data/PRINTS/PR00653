ACTIVIN2R
Activin type II receptors are proteins of around 500 residues that share
a high degree of similarity (human and mouse sequences are 99% identical).
The receptor, which is involved in transmembrane signalling, consists of
an extracellular domain that specifically binds activin A, a single
membrane-spanning domain, and an intracellular kinase domain with
predicted serine/threonine specificity [1]. 

ACTIVIN2R is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for type II
activin receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
9 sequences: motifs 1-3 were drawn from the N-terminal portion of the
alignment (the putative extracellular domain), and motifs 4-6 from the
C-terminal portion (the cytoplasmic protein kinase domain). Two iterations
on OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 19 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were
also found: S27268 and I38935 are N- and C-terminal fragments; the
remaining matches are either activin fragments or serine/threonine protein 
kinases that match motifs 4 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 16
partial matches.
