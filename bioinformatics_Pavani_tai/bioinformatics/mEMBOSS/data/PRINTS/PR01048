Y414FAMILY
The uncharacterised protein MJ0414 from Methanococcus jannaschii [1] belongs
to a conserved family that includes proteins from other archaea and from the
thermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. 

Nothing is known about the function of this conserved family, although a
recent BLAST analysis has suggested a possible relationship with ATP-
dependent DNA ligases [2]. The reported alignment was, however, at the 
Twilight level of significance, and the matched enzyme sequence was more
than twice the size of MJ0414. 

Y414FAMILY is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
hypothetical protein MJ0414 family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on
OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being 
identified beyond the starting set (DNA ligase, DNL4_YEAST, matches at the
level of noise with motifs 3 and 7, motif 3 including the putative catalytic
lysine). 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
