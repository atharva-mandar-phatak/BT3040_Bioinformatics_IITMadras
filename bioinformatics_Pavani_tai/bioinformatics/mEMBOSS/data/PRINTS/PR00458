PEROXIDASE
Peroxidases are haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions.
Most haem peroxidases follow the reaction scheme:

Fe(3+) + H2O2            --> [Fe(4+)=O]R' (Compound I) + H2O  
[Fe(4+)=O]R' + substrate --> [Fe(4+)=O]R (Compound II) + oxidised substrate
[Fe(4+)=O]R  + substrate -->  Fe(3+) + H2O + oxidised substrate

In this mechanism, the enzyme reacts with one equivalent of H2O2 to give 
[Fe(4+)=O]R' (compound I). This is a two-electron oxidation/reduction 
reaction where H2O2 is reduced to water and the enzyme is oxidised. One 
oxidising equivalent resides on iron, giving the oxyferryl [Fe(4+)=O] 
intermediate, while in many peroxidases the porphyrin (R) is oxidised to 
the porphyrin pi-cation radical (R'). Compound I then oxidises an organic 
substrate to give a substrate radical [1].

Peroxidases are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. On the basis
of sequence similarity, fungal, plant and bacterial peroxidases can be
viewed as members of a superfamily consisting of 3 major classes [2]. Class
I, the intracellular peroxidases, includes: yeast cytochrome c peroxidase
(CCP), a soluble protein found in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain, where it probably protects against toxic peroxides; ascorbate
peroxidase (AP), the main enzyme responsible for hydrogen peroxide removal
in chloroplasts and cytosol of higher plants [3]; and bacterial catalase-
peroxidases, exhibiting both peroxidase and catalase activities. It is
thought that catalase-peroxidase provides protection to cells under
oxidative stress [4].

Class II consists of secretory fungal peroxidases: ligninases, or lignin 
peroxidases (LiPs), and manganese-dependent peroxidases (MnPs). These are
monomeric glycoproteins involved in the degradation of lignin. In MnP,
Mn(2+) serves as the reducing substrate [5]. Class II proteins contain 4
conserved disulphide bridges and 2 conserved calcium-binding sites.                                               

Class III consists of the secretory plant peroxidases, which have multiple 
tissue-specific functions: e.g., removal of hydrogen peroxide from
chloroplasts and cytosol; oxidation of toxic compounds; biosynthesis of the
cell wall; defence responses towards wounding; indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) 
catabolism; ethylene biosynthesis; and so on [6]. Class III proteins are 
also monomeric glycoproteins, containing 4 conserved disulphide bridges 
and 2 calcium ions, although the placement of the disulphides differs 
from class II enzymes.

To date, 3D structures have been determined for yeast CCP [7], LiP [8] and
MnP [9] from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a fungal peroxidase from
Arthromyces ramosus [10], pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase [11] and peanut
peroxidase [12]. All these proteins share the same architecture, consisting
of 2 all-alpha domains, between which the haem group is embedded. 

PEROXIDASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for fungal,
plant and bacterial peroxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 23 sequences: motif 1 contains invariant active site residues
(Arg and the "distal" His) and a conserved aromatic residue that together
form a ligand pocket for hydrogen peroxide (cf. PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_2
(PS00436)); motifs 2 and 3 are adjacent, motif 2 encoding helix D of CCP,
MnP and AP [7,9,11]; and motif 4 contains the invariant "proximal" His,
which serves the axial ligand of the haem iron, and spans the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern PEROXIDASE_1 (PS00435). Two iterations on OWL27.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 136
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found:
CATA_MYCTU fails to match motif 3; CATA_RHOCA and three fragments (PHU31095,
C32322, PS0012) lack motif 5; TOBPOXAN, POPHPOX14 and GMU41657 are fragments
lacking motif 1; MTU16727 is a fragment matching motifs 1, 2 and 4;
CATA_BACST matches motifs 1, 4 and 5; PS0010 and PS0011 are fragments
matching motifs 1-3; ATTS2079 is a fragment matching motifs 1 and 2; 
PERX_WHEAT is a fragment matching motifs 2 and 3; and S29727 is a fragment
matching motifs 1 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 228 sequences, and 18
partial matches.
