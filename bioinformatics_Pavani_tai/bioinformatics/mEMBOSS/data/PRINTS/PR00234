HIV1MATRIX
The HIV-1 matrix protein forms an icosahedral shell associated with
the inner membrane of the mature virus [1]. The functions of the protein
include anchoring the transmembrane envelope protein on the surface
of the virus; assisting in viral penetration; transporting the pro-
viral integration complex across the nuclear envelope; and localising
the assembling virion to the cell membrane.

The structure of the protein comprises 5 alpha-helices, a short 3.10
helix and a 3-stranded mixed beta-sheet [1]. The first 3 helices and the
3.10 region pack around the fourth helix to form a compact globular
domain that is capped by the beta-sheet. The C-terminal helix projects
away from the sheet to expose C-terminal residues essential for early
steps in the HIV-1 infectious cycle. Basic residues, implicated in
membrane binding and nuclear localisation functions, cluster around
an extruded cationic loop that connects strands 1 and 2.

HIV1MATRIX is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
HIV-1 matrix proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from highly-conserved
regions spanning the full length of the mature protein, motif 2
including the basic residues implicated in membrane binding. Three
iterations of OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 70 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also found, a matrix protein fragment lacking the
final 2 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 206 sequences, and 38
partial matches.
