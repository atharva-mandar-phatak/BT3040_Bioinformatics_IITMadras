SSPANPROTEIN
The Salmonella typhimurium surface presentation of antigens N/invasion 
protein J gene (SpaN/InvJ) is one of 12 that form a cluster responsible for 
invasion properties [1]. The gene product is required for entry by the 
bacterium into epithelial cells, and is thus considered to be a virulence 
factor [1]. Other Spa genes in the cluster are related to invasion (Inv) 
genes in similar Salmonella and Shigella species [2], and to flagella
biosynthesis genes in Helicobacter pylori [3].
    
Functional analysis of the gene product from SpaN/InvJ has revealed the
protein to have a molecular weight of 36.4Kda [4]. It is required by the 
organism to gain access to mammalian epithelial cells, and cellular mutants 
(InvJ-) fail successfully to infect these cells.

It has been found, also, that the inv-spa loci of Salmonella species 
encode a type III protein secretion system, essential to the bacterium's
host cell invasion process [5]. Suprisingly, type III-secreted proteins
lack the customary signal sequence characteristic of most bacterial
secretory peptides [4].

SSPANPROTEIN is a 14-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
SpaN/InvJ protein family of Salmonella typhimurium. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn 
from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~340 amino acids).
Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 15 sequences was identified.
