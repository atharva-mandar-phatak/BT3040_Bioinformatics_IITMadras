GLHYDRLASE58
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 58 includes the endo-N-acetyl-neuraminidases (EC 
3.2.1.129).

Bacteriophage E specifically recognises and infects strains of E.coli
that display the alpha-2,8-linked polysialic acid K1 capsule [5,6]. 
Bacteriophage E endosialidase is thought to be responsible for initial
absorption of the phage to the host bacterium [5]. The native enzyme is
probably a trimer of identical 74kDa subunits. Within the K1E endosialidase
sequence, a central region of 500 amino acids shows 84% identity to K1F 
endosialidase [5]. Both enzymes contain two copies of a sialidase sequence
motif common to many bacterial and viral sialidases. These motifs flank
the region of greatest identity between the two endosialidases, suggesting
that this domain is involved in binding and hydrolysis of the polysialic
acid substrate [5].

GLHYDRLASE58 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 58 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment. Two iterations on OWL30.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 
3 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
