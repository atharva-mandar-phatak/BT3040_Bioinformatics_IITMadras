SALSPVBPROT
Salmonella typhimurium contains a 90kb plasmid that is associated with
virulence [1]. This plasmid encodes at least 6 genes needed by the 
bacterium for invading host macrophages during infection. These include the
70kDa mkaA protein [2], a recognised virulence factor, and more recently 
described, four spv genes under the control of a regulator [3].

The spv genes are induced under carbon-poor conditions at a stationary phase 
of growth, and their expression is under the control of both the spvR 
regulator, and the katF locus in Salmonella [3]. It has been proposed that 
individual spv proteins may be required at different time points during 
infection [4].

SpvB is a 65kDa protein that has been localised to the bacterial cytoplasm 
[4]. Its expression peaks during early stationary phase, but declines as the 
latent phase of the infection is reached, suggesting a role in initiating 
virulence [4].

SALSPVBPROT is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Salmonella virulence plasmid 65kDa B protein family. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were
drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~100 amino 
acids). Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified. Amongst these
is a bacterial insecticidal protein, indicating that this virulence plasmid
may have been involved in conjugation with other microbes.
