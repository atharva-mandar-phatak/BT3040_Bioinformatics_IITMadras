ALPHACATENIN
Catenins associate with the cytoplasmic domains of a variety of cadherins
[1], so producing a complex that links to the actin filament network. This
association appears to be indispensable for tight cell-cell adhesion - 
dysfunction of the complex causes dissociation of cancer cells from primary
tumours, possibly contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis [2]. Three
different forms of catenin (designated alpha, beta and gamma) comprise the 
cytoplasmic domain of the cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex [3]. Alpha-
catenins, proteins of ~100 Kd, are evolutionarily related to vinculin [3]. 

ALPHACATENIN is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
alpha and alpha-2 catenins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found: CER13H43 is an
alpha-catenin from C.elegans that fails to match motifs 1 and 2; the rest
are vinculins, all of which match motifs 8 and 9.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
