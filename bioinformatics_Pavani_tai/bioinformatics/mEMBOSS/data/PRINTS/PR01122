FMOXYGENASE2
Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) constitute a family of xenobiotic-
metabolising enzymes [1]. Using an NADPH cofactor and FAD prosthetic group,
these microsomal proteins catalyse the oxygenation of nucleophilic nitrogen,
sulphur, phosphorous and selenium atoms in a range of structurally diverse
compounds. FMOs have been implicated in the metabolism of a number of
pharmaceuticals, pesticides and toxicants. In man, lack of hepatic FMO-
catalysed trimethylamine metabolism results in trimethylaminuria (fish 
odour syndrome).

Five mammalian forms of FMO are now known and have been designated
FMO1-FMO5 [2-6]: this is a recent nomenclature based on comparison of
amino acid sequences, and has been introduced in an attempt to eliminate
confusion inherent in multiple, laboratory-specific designations and
tissue-based classifications [1]. Following the determination of the
complete nucleotide sequence of S.cerevisiae [7], a novel gene was found
to encode a protein with similarity to mammalian monooygenases.

Guinea pig and rabbit both express two variants of 'lung' FMO, observed as
three distinct phenotypes based on mobility differences in SDS-PAGE [8].
The coding regions of the guinea pig variants differ at only two positions,
both of which result in amino acid substitutions [8]. Similarly, the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the rabbit variants differ at only
two positions. The amino sequence contains putative FAD- (GxGxxG) and NADP+-
binding (GxGxxA) sites, a 'FATGY' motif that has also been observed in a 
range of siderphore biosynthetic enzymes [9], and a C-terminal hydrophobic
segment that is believed to anchor the monooxygenase to the microsomal
membrane [10].

The activities of the enzymes are characteristic of the lung FMO, and the
mobilities of the expressed enzymes are the same as those observed for the
variants present in guinea pig pulmonary microsomal preparations [8]. Both
rabbit and guinea pig lung FMO are associated with a single gene. Rabbit 
lung FMO exists in tight association with the calcium-binding protein, 
calreticulin [11]. It is thought that complexation of calreticulin with 
rabbit lung FMO could account for some of the unusual physical properties
of this FMO enzyme form.   

FMOXYGENASE2 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for type
2 flavin-containing monooxygenases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise type 2 FMOs but distinguish them from the rest
of the FMO family - motif 9 spans the C-terminal hydrophobic region thought
to act as a membrane anchor. A single iteration on SPTR37_9f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set. A single partial match was found, a human type 2 FMO fragment (Q99518),
which lacks the portion of sequence bearing the final 2 motifs.
