ANTHRAXTOXNA
A large group of bacterial exotoxins are referred to as "A/B toxins", 
essentially because they are formed from two subunits [1]. The "A" subunit
possesses enzyme activity, and is transferred to the host cell following
a conformational change in the membrane-bound transport "B" subunit [1].

Bacillus anthracis, a large Gram-positive spore-forming rod, is the 
causative agent of anthrax [2]. Its two virulence factors are the 
poly-D-glutamate polypeptide capsule, and the actual anthrax exotoxin [4].
The toxin comprises three factors: the protective antigen (PA); the oedema
factor (EF) [2]; and the lethal factor (LF) [3]. Each is a thermolabile 
protein of ~80kDa. PA forms the "B" part of the exotoxin and allows passage
of the "A" moiety (consisting of EF and LF) into target cells.

EF is necessary for the oedema-producing activity of the toxin, and is 
known to be an inherent adenylate cyclase. It causes dysregulation of 
intracellular signalling [2,4]. Uptake of the lethal factor LF occurs via 
activated heptameric PA. Once inside the host lymphocytes/macrophages, the
zinc metalloprotease of LF [5] cleaves MAP kinases, inhibits cell 
proliferation, and leads to cell death [3,4]. 

ANTHRAXTOXNA is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
Bacillus anthracis anthrax toxin LF proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. A single
iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
