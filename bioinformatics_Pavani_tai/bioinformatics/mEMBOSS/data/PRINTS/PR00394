RHSPROTEIN
RHS elements are proteins of non-essential function believed to play an
important role in the natural ecology of the cell. The protein sequences
comprise highly conserved N-terminal domains containing multiple tandem
22-residue repeats, followed by divergent C-terminal domains [1,2]. 

RHSPROTEIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for RHS
precursor proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs span the highly-conserved region towards the
C-terminal portion of the alignment following the tandem repeats. Two
iterations on OWL OWL26.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. A single partial
match was also found, an RHS protein fragment lacking the first 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 1
partial match.
