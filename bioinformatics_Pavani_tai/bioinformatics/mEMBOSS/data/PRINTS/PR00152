RUBISCOSMALL
RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a bifunctional
enzyme that catalyses both the carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) [1], thus fixing carbon dioxide as the first step
of the Calvin cycle [2]. RuBisCO is the major protein in the stroma of
chloroplasts, and in higher plants exists as a complex of 8 large and 8
small subunits: the function of the small subunit is unknown [2]. While
the large subunit is coded for by a single gene, the small subunit is
coded for by several different genes, which are distributed in a tissue
specific manner - they are transcriptionally regulated by light receptor
phytochrome [3], which results in RuBisCO being more abundant during the
day when it is required. 

RUBISCOSMALL is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
RuBisCO small subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 1 and 2 comprising
part of the chloroplast localisation sequence. Three iterations on OWL21.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
62 sequences was identified. Several partial matches was also found, all
of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 93 sequences, and 12
partial matches.
