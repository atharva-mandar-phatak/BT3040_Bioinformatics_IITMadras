FMOXYGENASE
Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) constitute a family of xenobiotic-
metabolising enzymes [1]. Using an NADPH cofactor and FAD prosthetic group,
these microsomal proteins catalyse the oxygenation of nucleophilic nitrogen,
sulphur, phosphorous and selenium atoms in a range of structurally diverse
compounds. FMOs have been implicated in the metabolism of a number of
pharmaceuticals, pesticides and toxicants. In man, lack of hepatic FMO-
catalysed trimethylamine metabolism results in trimethylaminuria (fish 
odour syndrome).

Five mammalian forms of FMO are now known and have been designated
FMO1-FMO5 [2-6]: this is a recent nomenclature based on comparison of
amino acid sequences, and has been introduced in an attempt to eliminate
confusion inherent in multiple, laboratory-specific designations and
tissue-based classifications [1]. Following the determination of the
complete nucleotide sequence of S.cerevisiae [7], a novel gene was found
to encode a protein with similarity to mammalian monooygenases.

FMOXYGENASE is a 13-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
flavin-containing monooxygenases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 17 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the N-terminal two-thirds of the alignment - motif 1 spans 
the region presumed to bind FAD (ADP moiety); and motif 11 includes the 
so-called FATGY motif that has also been observed in a range of siderphore 
biosynthetic enzymes [8]. Two iterations on SPTR37_9f were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 20 sequences was 
identified. Several partial matches were also found, largely unidentified 
sequences from the C.elegans genome project, and a tryptophan 2-mono-
oxygenase from Agrobacterium rhizogenes that matches 2 motifs.
