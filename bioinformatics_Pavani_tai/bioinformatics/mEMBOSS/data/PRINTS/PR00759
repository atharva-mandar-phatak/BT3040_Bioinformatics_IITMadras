BASICPTASE
The Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors are short (~50 residue)
alpha/beta proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained
by 3 disulphide bonds, which can be depticted schematically as follows:

           +-----------------------+
           |  +--------+           |
           |  |      **|*******    |
         xxCxxC#xxxCxxxCxxxxxxCxxxxCxx
                   |          |
                   +----------+

           <------50 residues------>

C denotes cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond formation;
# marks the active site residue.

The prototype for this family is bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor [1] (or 
basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members
[2-5], such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin
inhibitors; trypstatin, a rat mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain
found in an alternatively-spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein;
domains at the C-termini of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) chains of type VII
and type VI collagens; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor.

BASICPTASE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 includes helix 1; and
motifs 2 and 3, which include strand 2 and helix 2 res., span the region 
encoded by PROSITE pattern BPTI_KUNITZ (PS00280), which lies between the 
third and the fifth cysteine residues. Three iterations on OWL29.4 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 133
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of
which are fragments and family members that fail to match motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 90 sequences, and 20
partial matches.
