COLDSHOCK
When E.coli is exposed to a temperature drop from 37 to 10 degrees
centigrade, a 4-5 hour lag phase occurs, after which growth is resumed at
a reduced rate [1]. During the lag phase, the expression of around 13
proteins, which contain specific DNA-binding regions [2], is increased
2-10 fold. These so-called 'cold shock' proteins are thought to help the
cell to survive in temperatures lower than optimum growth temperature, by
contrast with heat shock proteins, which help the cell to survive in
temperatures greater than the optimum, possibly by condensation of the
chromosome and organization of the prokaryotic nucleoid [1].

COLDSHOCK is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
cold shock proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
COLD_SHOCK (PS00352), the putative DNA-binding domain. Two iterations on
OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 21 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also
found, a fragment matching motifs 1 and 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 89 sequences, and 1
partial match.
