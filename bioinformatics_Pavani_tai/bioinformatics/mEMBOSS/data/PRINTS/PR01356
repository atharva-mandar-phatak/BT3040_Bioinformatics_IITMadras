GFGPROTEIN
An antisense transcript from the Xenopus laevis basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) gene has been shown to code for an unknown 24kDa protein [1].
The protein contains an evolutionarily conserved MutT domain core, which
is a characteristic of the NUDIX hydrolase family [2].

GFGPROTEIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
anti-sense to fibroblast growth factor GFG transcripts. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the N- and C-terminal portions of the alignment -
motifs 1-4 lie immediately N-terminal to the MutT domain, and motifs 5-8
immediately C-terminal to it. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 3 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was found, O95097, the human antisense
basic fibroblast growth factor A, which fails to match the 4 N-terminal 
motifs.
