ENTEROTOXINB
E.coli heat-labile enterotoxin is a bacterial protein toxin with an AB5
multimer structure, in which the B pentamer has a membrane-binding function
and the A subunit is needed for enzymatic activity [1]. The B subunits are
arranged as a donut-shaped pentamer, each subunit participating in ~30
hydrogen bonds and 6 salt bridges with its two neighbours [1]. 

The A subunit has a less well-defined secondary structure. It predominantly
interacts with the pentamer via the C-terminal A2 fragment, which runs
through the charged central pore of the B subunits. A putative catalytic
residue in the A1 fragment (Glu112) lies close to a hydrophobic region,
which packs two loops together. It is thought that this region might be
important for catalysis and membrane translocation [1]. 

ENTEROTOXINB is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
heat labile enterotoxin B chains. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 spans helix 1 and
strand 1; motif 2 spans strands 2 and 3; motif 3 includes strand 4 and
the N-terminus of helix 2; motif 4 includes the C-terminus of helix 2
and strand 5; and motif 5 encodes strand 6. Two iterations on OWL29.4
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
11 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
