INTRLEUKIN34
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in 
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating 
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-34 (IL-34) was identified via functional screening of a library
of secreted proteins [1]. The cytokine promotes the differentiation and 
viability of monocytes and macrophages through the colony-stimulating 
factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) [1].

INTRLEUKIN34 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-34. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was
identified.
