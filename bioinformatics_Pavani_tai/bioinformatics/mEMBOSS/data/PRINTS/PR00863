NODAVIRPTASE
Aspartic proteases have a catalytic aspartate residue at their active site.
More than 8 families (denoted A1-A9) have been identified, three of which 
(pepsin, retropepsin and cauliflower mosaic virus peptidase) have been 
grouped into a single clan (AA), as they are all thought to have a common 
ancestry. The remaining five families have not yet been assigned to clans 
[1-3].

Nodavirus coat precusor endopeptidases belong to the A6 family of aspartic
proteases [4]. At the moment, it is not clear whether they share a common 
ancestry with other aspartic proteases. Nodaviruses are small, icosahedral
viruses, pathogenic to insects and mammals. A virus particle consists of a 
single virion, within which is packaged two RNA stands, RNA1 and RNA2. 
Nodavirus coat precursor endopeptidase (also known as protein alpha) is the 
only protein encoded by RNA2. During the process of virion assembly, this 
precursor is cleaved into coat proteins beta and gamma. RNA1 encodes two
proteins, at least one of which is involved in RNA replication. The 
relatively uncomplicated nature of their structural protein and RNA 
constituents make the nodaviruses a good virus model [4].

The 3D structure of the capsid protein has been determined by X-ray
crystallography to 2.8A resolution [4]. The structure contains a beta-barrel
domain, with a prominent protrusion composed largely of beta-sheet. This 
protrusion, together with similar protrusions from neighbouring subunits,
forms a prominent trigonal pyramid with quasi-3-fold symmetry [4]. Two
alpha-helices extend toward the interior of the particle [4].

NODAVIRPTASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
nodavirus coat proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the first two
alpha-helices; motif 2 spans the C-terminus of the second beta-strand,
leading into the third strand; motif 3 includes helix 3; motif 4 spans
strands 5-7; motif 5 encompasses strands 10 and 11, and helix 5, which
lies between them; motif 6 includes strand 16; and motif 7 lies at the
C-terminus. A single iteration on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set of 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
