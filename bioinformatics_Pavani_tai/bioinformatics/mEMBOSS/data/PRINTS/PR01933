INTRLEUKIN18
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that has 
pleiotropic immunoregulatory functions, including augmentation of IFN-gamma
production, Fas-mediated cytotoxicity, and developmental regulation of 
T-lymphocyte helper type I [1]. The cytokine plays a critical role in the 
defense against intracellular bacteria, including Listeria, Shigella, 
Salmonella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2].

INTRLEUKIN18 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-18. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Three iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 38 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, A0PJ18_MOUSE, a murine
translated cDNA sequence that fails to match motif 3.
