MECHCHANNEL
Mechano-sensitive channels are ion channels that are directly activated by
stretch forces in the membrane lipid bilayer. Such channels have been
detected in neurones, heart, lens, muscle and blood cells of animals.
They are also present in plant cells, yeast and bacteria. Following
solubilisation and purification, a bacterial envelope protein thought to be
a mechano-sensitive channel was isolated from E.coli. This was partially
sequenced and used to identify and clone the corresponding gene (mscL).
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that expression of this gene alone is
sufficient to produce a large-conductance mechano-sensitive channel with
similar properties to those found for mechano-sensitive channels in native 
bacterial membranes [1].

mscL encodes a protein of 136 amino acid residues. The first ~3/4 of the
sequence is highly hydrophobic and is thought to contain two transmembrane
(TM) domains. mscL homologues have also been identified in a number of 
Gram-positive bacteria. They do not show significant sequence similarity to
other ion channel subunits that are predicted to contain 2 TM domains, such
as the P2X receptors and the extended epithelial sodium channel family [2].

MECHCHANNEL is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bacterial mechano-sensitive ion channels. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the N-terminal 3/4 of the alignment - motif 1 spans the end
of the putative cytoplasmic N-terminus, and the start of the following
TM domain; motif 2 lies in the second TM domain; and motif 3 spans the end
of the second TM domain and the start of the putative cytoplasmic C-terminus.
A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. A single partial
match was found, Q9Z5G4, a Mycobacterium leprae sequence that is presumed
to be a mechano-sensitive ion channel.
