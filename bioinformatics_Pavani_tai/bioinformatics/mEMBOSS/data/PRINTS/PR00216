OSTEOPONTIN
The major event of endochondrial ossification is the proteolytic
degradation of calcified cartilage and the extracellular matrix, and their
substitution with bone-specific extracellular matrix produced and organised
by osteoblasts [1]. One of the most abundant products of osteoblasts is
osteopontin, a glycosylated phosphoprotein with a high acidic amino acid
content and one copy of the cell attachment sequence RGD [1]. It is thought
that osteopontin may act as a bridge between osteoblasts and the apatite
mineral of the bone [1]. Osteopontin-K is a kidney protein, similar to
osteopontin and probably also involved in cell adhesion [2]

OSTEOPONTIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
osteopontins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length, motif 1 including the conserved N-terminal sequence
encoded by PROSITE pattern OSTEOPONTIN (PS00884). Two iterations on
OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences.
