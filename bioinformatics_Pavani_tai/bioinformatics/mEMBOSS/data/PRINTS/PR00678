PI3KINASEP85
PI3 kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate phosphoinositides on the
3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring. The precise functions of the three
products of PI3 kinase (PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P and PI-3,4,5-P) are not yet
known, but it is suggested that they function as second messengers in
signal transduction events in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.
There are several forms of PI3 kinase. One of these is the mammalian enzyme, 
a heterodimer of a 110kDa catalytic subunit and an 85kDa regulatory subunit,
which allows it to bind to activated tyrosine protein kinases. PI3 kinase 
P85 alpha subunits contain an N-terminal SH3 domain, and two SH2 domains in
the C-terminal half of the sequence. 

PI3KINASEP85 is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
PI3 kinase P85-alpha subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motifs 1 and 2 lie in the
first SH2 domain; and motifs 8-10 span the second SH2 domain. Two
iterations on OWL 29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified.     

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
