NEBULIN
Nebulin is a 600-800kDa protein found in the thin filaments of striated
vertebrate muscle. It is presumed to play a role in binding and stabilising
F-actin [1], essentially by providing a template for actin polymerisation 
(i.e., acting as an "actin zipper"). The amino acid sequence shows a
uniform repeating pattern along its length, a repeated 35-residue motif
constituting up to 97% of the polypeptide. Analysis of individual repeats
reveals a progressive N- to C-terminal divergence, coupled with an
increasing alpha-helix propensity [1]. This correlates with a higher
binding affinity for F-actin at the C-terminus. Thus, it is postulated
that once the repeats have formed an initiation complex, the whole length
of the nebulin molecule may then associate in a highly co-operative process
with the thin filament, in a manner similar to the closing of a zipper [1].

NEBULIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for nebulins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning 3 repeats in the
central portion of the alignment. Two iterations on OWL28.0 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found (OCNBLNP and BOVNBLNA), 
both of which are fragments. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
