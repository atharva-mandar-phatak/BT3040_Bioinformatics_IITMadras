JOSEPHIN
Human genes containing triplet repeats can markedly expand in length, leading
to neuropsychiatric disease [1]. Expansion of triplet repeats explains the
phenomenon of anticipation, i.e. the increasing severity or earlier age of
onset in successive generations in a pedigree [1].

A novel gene containing CAG repeats has been identified and mapped to
chromosome 14q32.1, the genetic locus for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) [2].
Normally, the gene contains 13-36 CAG repeats, but most clinically diagnosed
patients and all affected members of a family with the clinical and 
pathological diagnosis of MJD show expansion of the repeat number, from 
68-79 [2]. Similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases
similar to MJD. 

MJD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by cerebellar ataxia, 
pyramidal and extra-pyramidal signs, peripheral nerve palsy, external 
ophtalmoplegia, facial and lingual fasciculation and bulging. The disease
is autosomal dominant, with late onset of symptoms, generally after the
fourth decade.

JOSEPHIN is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
josephins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virutally
the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set. A single partial match was found, O17850, the C.elegans F28F8.6 protein, 
which matches motifs 1 and 3-6.
