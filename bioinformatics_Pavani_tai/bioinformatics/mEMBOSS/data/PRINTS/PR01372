YERSINIAYOPE
Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves 
transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell 
exterior [1]. There have been four secretion systems described in 
animal enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further 
sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [1]. 

The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to 
transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell 
[1] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with
the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of 
bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [1]. However, while the latter forms a
ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of
the flagellum itself [1], type III subunits in the outer membrane
translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.

Exotoxins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal,
and are considered unique for this reason [1]. Yersinia spp. secrete a Rho
GTPase-activating protein, YopE [2,3], that disrupts the host cell actin 
cytoskeleton. YopE is regulated by another bacterial gene, SycE [4], that 
enables the exotoxin to remain soluble in the bacterial cytoplasm. A similar
protein, exoenzyme S from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has both ADP-ribosylation 
and GTPase activity [3,4].

YERSINIAYOPE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Yersinia type III secreted virulence determinant YopE protein family. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the 
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length
(~450 amino acids). Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q51445, a Pseudomonas
type III secreted exoenzyme, which fails to match motifs 3 and 6.
