DISEASERSIST
Plants are attacked by a range of phytopathegenic organisms, including
viruses, mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa and parasites.
Resistance to a pathogen is manifested in several ways and is often
correlated with a hypersensitive response (HR), localised induced cell
death in the host plant at the site of infection [1]. The induction of
the plant defense response that leads to HR is initiated by the plant's
recognition of specific signal molecules (elicitors) produced by the
pathogen; R genes are thought to encode receptors for these elicitors.

RPS2, N and L6 genes confer resistance to bacterial, viral and fungal
pathogens. Sequence analysis has shown that they contain C-terminal
leucine-rich repeats, which are characteristic of plant and animal
proteins involved in protein-protein interactions [1]. In addition,
the sequences contain a conserved nucleotide-binding site towards
their N-termini.

DISEASERSIST is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
disease resistance proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 1 encoding
a nucleotide-binding P-loop. Two iterations on OWL26.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 3 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, AFSR_STRCO, a
Streptomyces regulatory protein that matches motifs 1 and 3 (and
also weakly with motif 2).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 40 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
