MUTATORMUTX
MutT is a small bacterial protein (~12-15kDa) involved in the GO system [1]
responsible for removing an oxidatively damaged form of guanine (8-hydroxy-
guanine or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) from the nucleotide pool. 8-oxo-dGTP
is inserted opposite dA and dC residues of template DNA with near equal
efficiency, leading to A.T to G.C transversions. MutT degrades 8-oxo-dGTP 
to the monophosphate, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate. A short
conserved N-terminal region of mutT (designated the MutT domain) is also
found in a variety of other prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic proteins
[2-5]. Recently, the generic name 'NUDIX hydrolases' (NUcleoside DIphosphate
linked to some other moeity X) has been coined for this domain family [6].

MutX is a 17kDa protein that shares some similarity with Escherichia coli 
MutT. Like MutT, the pure MutX protein hydrolyses all canonical nucleoside 
triphosphates at different rates, with a preference for dGTP, yielding 
nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate [7]. Despite the
similarity in enzymatic activity, the two proteins have distinct primary
and quaternary structures [7]. Their sequences share only a small region 
of similarity (the MutT domain), and under the same conditions in which 
MutT exists as a monomer in solution, MutX behaves as a trimer [7]. 

MUTATORMUTX is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for mutator
MutX proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions N- and 
C-terminal to the MutT domain. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
