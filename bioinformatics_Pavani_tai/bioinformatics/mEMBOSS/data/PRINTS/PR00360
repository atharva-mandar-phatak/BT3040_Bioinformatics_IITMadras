C2DOMAIN
C2 domains are Ca2+-regulatory domains found widely in nature. To date,
more than 40 distinct C2 domains have been identified, for example in
proteins such as synaptotagmin, phospholipase A2, GTPase-activating
proteins, rabphilin and phospholipase C isoforms [1]. The domains show
no sequence similarity to other Ca2+-binding proteins; they thus
constitute a novel family of Ca2+-regulatory motifs, which also
includes members that have lost their calcium regulation.

The structure of C2 domains in synaptotagmin I has been deduced: the C2
polypeptide forms an 8-stranded beta-sandwich constructed around a 
conserved 4-stranded motif, designated a C2 key [1]. Calcium binds in
a cup-shaped depression formed by the N- and C-terminal loops of the
C2-key motif.

C2DOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for C2
domains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 12
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions within
the C2-key core, corresponding to strands 3, 5 and 6 res., and including
3 of the 4 acidic residues involved in Ca2+ ligation. Three iterations on
OWL26.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 74 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were
also found, which was to be expected since the degree of sequence
divergence was high and the motifs therefore relatively short.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 86 sequences, and 38
partial matches.
