VD09PROTEIN
The complete DNA sequence of the genome of vaccinia virus has been 
determined [1]. 198 "major" protein-coding regions and 65 overlapping
"minor" regions have been identified, with a total of 263 potential genes
[1]. The genes are compactly organised along the genome, with few noncoding
regions [1]. The function of the majority of proteins encoded by these open
reading frames is so far undetermined. 

The D9 protein contains an evolutionarily conserved MutT domain core,
which is also found in a variety of other viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic
proteins.

VD09PROTEIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for viral
D9 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the N- and
C-terminal portions of the alignment - motifs 1-4 lie immediately N-terminal
to the MutT domain, motif 4 encoding its N-terminus; and motifs 5-8 
immediately C-terminal to it. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q98265, a Molluscum 
contagiosum virus subtype 1 protein that fails to make significant matches
with motifs 1 and 7.
