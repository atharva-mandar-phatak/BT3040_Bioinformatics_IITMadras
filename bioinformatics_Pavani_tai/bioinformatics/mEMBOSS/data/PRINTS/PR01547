YEAST176DUF
The complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VIII
contains 269 predicted or known genes (of 300bp or larger) [1]. Of these, 59
had previously been identified; of the 210 novel genes, 65 encode putative
proteins similar to other proteins of known or predicted function [1]. 

Amongst the gene products is a hypothetical 175.8kDa protein that belongs to
a well-conserved family that shares no sequence similarity with any other 
known proteins. The sequences are characterised by an N-terminal domain of
variable length, and a C-terminal WD-repeat-containing domain. 

YEAST176DUF is a 13-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae 175.8kDa protein and related proteins. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs
were drawn from conserved regions largely spanning the N-terminal half of 
the alignment - motifs 1-12 span the N-terminal domain; and motif 13 lies 
within the fourth WD repeat. Two iterations on SPTR39_15f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q9N8Q1, a possible
T16O11.22 protein from Trypanosoma brucei.
