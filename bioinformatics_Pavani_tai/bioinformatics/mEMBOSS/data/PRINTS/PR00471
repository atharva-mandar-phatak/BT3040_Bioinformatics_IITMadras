ACETATEKNASE
Acetate kinase, which is predominantly found in micro-organisms, facilitates
the production of acetyl-CoA by phosphorylating acetate in the presence of
ATP and a divalent cation [1,2]. The enzyme is important in the process of
glycolysis, enzyme levels being increased in the presence of excess glucose
[1]. The growth of a bacterial mutant lacking acetate kinase has been shown
to be inhibited by glucose, suggesting that the enzyme is involved in
excretion of excess carbohydrate [1]. A related enzyme, butyrate kinase,
facilitates the formation of butyryl-CoA by phosphorylating butyrate in the
presence of ATP to form butyryl phosphate [2].

ACETATEKNASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
acetate kinase family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
virtually the alignment length, motifs 1 and 3 including the regions
encoded by PROSITE patterns ACETATE_KINASE_1 (PS01075) and ACETATE_KINASE_2
(PS01076), both of which may be involved in substrate or ATP-binding. Two
iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 20 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
