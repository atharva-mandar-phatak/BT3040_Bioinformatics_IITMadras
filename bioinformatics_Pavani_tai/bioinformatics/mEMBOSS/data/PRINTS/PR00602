BARWIN
Barwin is a basic protein isolated from aqueous extracts of barley seeds
[1]. It is 125 amino acids in length, and contains 6 cysteine residues that 
combine to form 3 disulphide bridges [1,2]. Comparative analysis shows the
sequence to be highly similar to a 122 amino acid stretch in the C-terminal
of the products of 2 wound-induced genes (win1 and win2) from potato, the 
product of the hevein gene of rubber trees, and pathogenesis-related 
protein 4 from tobacco [1,2]. The high levels of similarity to these 
proteins, and its ability to bind saccharides, suggest that the barwin 
domain may be involved in a common defense mechanism in plants [1,2].

NMR analysis shows that the secondary structure of the barwin domain is 
dominated by a large 4-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and a small 
parallel beta-sheet [2]. Three short alpha-helices are also present, the
remaining sequence forming loops and coils with no regular secondary
structure elements [2].

BARWIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the barwin
domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 8 sequences:
the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually the full
alignment length - motifs 2 and 4 include the regions encoded by PROSITE
patterns BARWIN_1 (PS00771) and BARWIN_2 (PS00772), which contain conserved
Cys residues. Two iterations on OWL28.2 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences.
