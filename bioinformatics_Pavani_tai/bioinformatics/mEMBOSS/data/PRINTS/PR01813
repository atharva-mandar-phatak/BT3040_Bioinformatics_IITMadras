ANNEXINFUNGI
The annexins (or lipocortins) are a family of proteins that bind to
phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner [1]. They are distributed
ubiquitously in different tissues and cell types of higher and lower
eukaryotes, including mammals, fish, birds, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus
laevis, Caenorhabtidis elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum and Neurospora 
crassa [2,3]. The plant annexins are somewhat distinct from those found in
other taxa [3].

Several distinct annexin subtypes exist, each of which has an amino acid
sequence consisting of an N-terminal 'arm' followed by 4 or 8 copies of a
conserved domain of 61 residues (only one of these residues, an arginine,
is conserved between all copies). The calcium binding sites are found within
the repeated domains [4]. Individual repeats (sometimes referred to as 
endonexin folds) consist of 5 alpha-helices wound into a right-handed
superhelix. The biological roles of some annexin subtypes is unclear; the
family has been linked with inhibition of phospholipase activity,
exocytosis and endoctyosis, signal transduction, organisation of the
extracellular matrix, resistance to reactive oxygen species and DNA
replication [2].

The first fungal annexin was reported in 1998, encoded by the anx14
gene of the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora crassa [2]. Phylogenetic
analyses clustered the fungal annexin with homologous proteins from a
number of animal species; this is consistent with the existence of an
animal-fungal clade.

ANNEXINFUNGI is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
type XIV fungal annexins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those sections
that characterise fungal type XIV annexins but distinguish them from other
closely related annexin subtypes - motifs 1 and 2 lie within the first core
repeat; motif 3 resides within the third repeat; and motifs 4 and 5 lie
within repeat 4. A single iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
