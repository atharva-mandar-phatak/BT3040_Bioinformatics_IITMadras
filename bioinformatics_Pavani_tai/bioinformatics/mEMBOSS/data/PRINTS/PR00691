ADHESINB
The Streptococcus pneumoniae psaA gene encodes a protein with significant
similarity to previously-reported Streptococcal proteins, SsaB (80%
similarity) and FimA (92.3% similarity), from S.sanguis and S.parasanguis
[1]. These homologues are associated with bacterial adhesion, and PsaA 
may play a similar role [1].

The SsaB protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence
yielding a 32,620-Mr secreted protein [2]. SsaB is hydrophilic and appears
not to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor in its C-terminal region. A high
degree of similarity exists between S.sanguis ssaB and type 1 fimbrial
genes [2]. Comparison of the gene products reveals close similarity of the
two proteins. It is thought that ssaB adhesion may play a role in oral
colonisation by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor
on Actinomyces. 

ADHESINB is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for adhesins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length, focusing on those sections that characterise the adhesin B
precursors but distinguish them from the rest of the adhesin family. A
single iteration on OWL29.2 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are adhesin B homologues.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 12
partial matches.
