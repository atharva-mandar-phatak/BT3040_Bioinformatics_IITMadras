ALKEXNUCLASE
Equine herpesvirus-1 is a respiratory virus capable of causing abortion and
neurological disease. Its complete DNA sequence has been determined [1] and
the constituent genes found to be arranged co-linearly with those in the
genomes of other alphaherpesviruses, namely varicella-zoster virus and 
herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) [1]. Comparisons of the predicted amino
acid sequences have allowed functions of many equine herpesvirus 1 proteins
to be inferred. 

For example, detailed analysis of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA has revealed an open 
reading frame sufficient to encode 626 amino acids for the HSV-1 alkaline
exonuclease (620 amino acids for HSV-2) [2]. Comparison of the predicted
amino acid sequences of the viral enzymes has revealed significant
differences in the N-terminal portions of the proteins; nevertheless, their
three-dimensional structures are believed to be similar. 

ALKEXNUCLASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
alphaherpesvirus alkaline exonuclease. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment. Three iterations
on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 19 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also
found, JC5169, a pseudorabies virus alkaline nuclease that matches motifs
1,4,5 and 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 1
partial match.
