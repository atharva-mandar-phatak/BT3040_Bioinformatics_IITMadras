INTERLEUKIN5
Interleukin-5 (IL5), also known as eosinophil differentiation factor (EDF),
is a lineage-specific cytokine for eosinophilpoiesis [1,2]. It regulates 
eosinophil growth and activation [1], and thus plays an important role in
diseases associated with increased levels of eosinophils, including asthma
[2]. 

IL5 has a similar overall fold to other cytokines (e.g., IL2, IL4 and GCSF)
[2], but while these exist as monomeric structures, IL5 is a homodimer. The
fold contains an anti-parallel 4-alpha-helix bundle with a left handed twist,
connected by a 2-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet [2,3]. The monomers are
held together by 2 interchain disulphide bonds [3].

INTERLEUKIN5 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
interleukin-5 cytokines. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 encodes the first
helix; motif 2 spans the first beta-strand and the second helix; motif 3
encodes the third helix; and motif 4 spans the second beta-strand and the 
fourth helix. Two iterations on OWL26.3 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_10f identified a true set of 11 sequences.
