GLFDHDRGNASE
Glutamate, leucine and phenylalanine dehydrogenases are structurally
and functionally related. They contain a Gly-rich region containing a
conserved Lys residue, which has been implicated in the catalytic activity,
in each case a reversible oxidative deamination reaction. Glutamate 
dehydrogenase catalyses the reversible oxidative deamination of L-glutamate
to alpha-ketoglutarate, using NAD and/or NADP as cofactors [1]. Two separate
enzymes are present in yeasts: the NADP-dependent enzyme, which catalyses
the amination of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate; and the NAD-dependent
enzyme, which catalyses the reverse reaction [2] - this form links the
L-amino acids with the Krebs cycle, which provides a major pathway for
metabolic interconversion of alpha-amino acids and alpha-keto acids [1].

Leucine dehydrogenase is an NAD-dependent enzyme that catalyses the 
reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic amino acids to
their keto analogues. Phenylalanine dehydrogenase is also NAD-dependent and
catalyses the reversible oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine to form
phenyl-pyruvate [3].

GLFDHDRGNASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
glutamate, leucine and phenylalanine dehydrogenases. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: motif 1 includes part of
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern GLF_DEHYDROGENASE (PS00074), which
contains the conserved Gly-rich region presumed important in the catalytic
mechanism. Two iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 29 sequences was identified. Two
partial matches were also found, both of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 70 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
