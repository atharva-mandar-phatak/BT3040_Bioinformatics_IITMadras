SYNAPTOPHYSN
Synaptophysin and synaptoporin are related glycoproteins: they are the major
integral membrane proteins of a certain class of small neurosecretory
vesicles [1,2], although they may also be found in vesicles of various
non-endocrine cells [2]. The polypeptide chain spans the membrane 4 times,
and possibly acts as an ion or solute channel.  

SYNAPTOPHYSN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
synaptophysin/synaptoporin family. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 4 sequences: motifs 1 and 3-5 encode the 4 trans-
membrane regions; motif 2, which spans a conserved region in the first
intravesicular loop, includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
SYNAPTOP (PS00604), the cysteine of which may be in involved in disulphide
bond formation. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, S20316, a synaptophysin
fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
