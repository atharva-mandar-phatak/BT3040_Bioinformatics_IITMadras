WILMSTUMOUR
Wilm's tumour (WT) is an embryonal malignancy of the kidney, affecting
around 1 in 10,000 infants. It occurs in both sporadic and hereditary
forms. Inactivation of WT1 is one of the causes of Wilm's tumour. Defects
in the WT1 gene are also associated with Denys-Drash Syndrome (DDS), which
is characterised by typical nephropathy and genital abnormalities. The
WT1 gene product shows similarity to the zinc fingers of the mammalian
growth regulated EGR1 and EGR2 proteins [1-4].

WILMSTUMOUR is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Wilm's
tumour proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from well-conserved, N-terminal
Gly/Pro-rich regions, motifs 2-4 spanning the inhibitory domain. Two
iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences, and 1
partial match.
