DNAPHOTLYASE
DNA photolyases are enzymes that bind to DNA containing pyrimidine dimers:
on absorption of visible light, they catalyse dimer splitting into the
constituent monomers, a process called photoreactivation [1]. This is a DNA
repair mechanism, repairing mismatched pyrimidine dimers induced by
exposure to ultra-violet light [2]. The precise mechanisms involved in
substrate binding, conversion of light energy to the mechanical energy
needed to rupture the cyclobutane ring, and subsequent release of the
product are uncertain [1]. Analysis of DNA lyases has revealed the presence
of an intrinsic chromophore, all monomers containing a reduced FAD moiety,
and, in addition, either a reduced pterin or 8-hydroxy-5-diazaflavin as a
second chromophore [2,3]. Either chromophore may act as the primary photon
acceptor, peak absorptions occurring in the blue region of the spectrum
and in the UV-B region, at a wavelength around 290nm [3].

DNAPHOTLYASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
DNA photolyases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 3 including the regions
encoded by PROSITE patterns DNA_PHOTOLYASE_1 (PS00394) and DNA_PHOTOLYASE_2
(PS00691). Two iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. A single
partial match was also found, SAPHR1, a DNA lyase from Sinapis alba, which
only matches motifs 2 and 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
