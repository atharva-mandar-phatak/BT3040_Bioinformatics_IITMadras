GLUTAREDOXIN
Glutaredoxin (or thioltransferase) [1], a small protein of around 100
residues, is an electron carrier in the glutathione-dependent synthesis
of deoxyribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase. The protein functions
in a manner similar to thioredoxin, and possesses an active centre 
disulphide bond. Sequence analysis has shown the protein to be similar
to vaccinia protein O2L [2] and to phage T4 thioredoxin. 

GLUTAREDOXIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
glutaredoxins and related thioredoxins and O2L proteins. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were
drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length, motif 1
including the active site region encoded by PROSITE pattern GLUTAREDOXIN
(PS00195), which contains the 2 cysteines of the redox-active bond. Two
iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 20 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 24 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
