FILOVP35
The filoviridae are a group of viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers with
a high mortality rate. The family currently contains three viruses: Ebola, 
Marburg and Reston, named after their corresponding outbreak regions [1]. 
They possess negative-stranded RNA genomes, which encode at least 7 proteins.
The VP35 protein is found in the genomes of all filoviruses. Its function is 
presently unknown, but it is thought to share the function of the 
phosphorylated proteins (polymerase subunits) of rhabdoviruses and 
paramyxoviruses due to its position in the genome. There is no evidence 
however, to suggest that VP35 is phosphorylated [2,3].

FILOVP35 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
filovirus VP35 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 
sequences was identified.
