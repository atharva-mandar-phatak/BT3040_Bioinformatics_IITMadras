TCTPROTEIN
Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) is a well-conserved,
ubiquitously expressed protein, found in species throughout the eukaryotic
kingdom. Nevertheless, the function of the protein is poorly understood. It
was first identified as a histamine-releasing factor, acting in IgE +-
dependent allergic reactions. In addition, TCTP has been shown to bind to
tubulin in the cytoskeleton, has a high affinity for calcium, is the binding
target for the antimalarial compound artemisinin, and is induced in vitamin
D-dependent apoptosis. TCTP production is thought to be controlled at the
translational as well as the transcriptional level [1].

TCTPs do not share significant sequence similarity with any other class of
proteins. Recently, the structure of TCTP was determined and exhibited
significant structural similarity to the human protein Mss4, which is a
guanine nucleotide-free chaperone of the Rab protein [2].

TCTPROTEIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
translationally controlled tumour proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1 includes
beta-strands 1 and 2; motif 2 lies in the loop between beta-strands 5 and 6;
and motif 3 encompasses beta-strand 6, helix 1 and beta-strand 7. Two
iterations on SPTR40_18f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 28 sequences was identified.
