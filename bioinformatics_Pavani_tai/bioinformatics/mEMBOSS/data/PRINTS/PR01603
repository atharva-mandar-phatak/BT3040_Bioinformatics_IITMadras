VDCCGAMMA4
Voltage-dependent calcium channels are a diverse family of proteins that 
encompass a variety of biological functions, including presynaptic
neurotransmitter release and protein signalling within the cell [1,2]. The
high voltage-activated channels (L-, N-, P-, Q- and R-type channels)
comprise the alpha-1 subunit, which creates the pore for the import of 
extracellular calcium ions [2]. The activity of this pore is modulated by 
four tightly-coupled subunits: an intracellular beta subunit; a
transmembrane (TM) gamma subunit; and a disulphide-linked complex of alpha-2
and delta subunits, which are proteolytically cleaved from the same gene 
product [3,4].

The voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma (VDCCG) subunit family consists 
of at least 8 members, which share a number of common structural features 
[5]. Each member is predicted to possess four TM domains, with intracellular
N- and C- termini. The first extracellular loop contains a highly conserved
N-glycosylation site and a pair of conserved cysteine residues. The 
C-terminal seven residues of VDCCG-2, -3, -4 and -8 are also conserved and 
contain a consensus site for phosphorylation by cAMP and cGMP-dependent
protein kinases, and a target site for binding by PDZ domain proteins [5].

The VDCCG-4 subunit is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue, although
there is some evidence for expression in lung and prostate [5,6]. The
modulatory properties of the subunit have been investigated using
heterologous expression systems. Coexpression of the VDCGG-4 subunit with 
P/Q-type channels shifts the steady-state inactivation curve of these 
channels to more hyperpolarised potentials [6,7].

VDCCGAMMA4 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-4 subunit proteins. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, 
focusing on those sections that characterise the VDCCG-4 sunbunits but 
distinguish them from other family members - motif 1 lies in the first 
extracellular loop; motif two spans part of TM domain 2 and extends into 
the intracellular loop; and motifs 3, 4 and 5 lie in the C-terminal 
cytoplasmic region. A single iteration on SPTR39.22_17.3f was required to 
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
