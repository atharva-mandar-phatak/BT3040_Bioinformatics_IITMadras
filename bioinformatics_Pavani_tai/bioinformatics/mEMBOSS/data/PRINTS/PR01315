BATTENIN
Batten's disease, the juvenile variant of neuronal ceroid lipofuscionosis
(NCL), is a recessively inherited disorder affecting children of 5-10
years of age. The disease is characterised by progressive loss of vision,
seizures and psychomotor disturbances. Biochemically, the disease is
characterised by lysosomal accumulation of hydrophobic material, mainly ATP
synthase subunit C, largely in the brain but also in other tissues [1]. 
Batten's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, 
affecting children with an incidence of 1/20000 to 1/10000 live births [1].
The disease is fatal within a decade. There are no current treatments
available.

Mutations in the CLN3 gene are believed to cause Batten's disease [1]. The
CLN3 gene maps to chromosome p16p12.1. The predicted product of the CLN3
gene is a 438-residue protein. The gene contains at least 15 exons spanning
15kb and is highly conserved in mammals [4]. A 1.02kb deletion in the CLN3
gene, occurring in either one or both alleles, is found in 85% of Batten 
disease chromosomes [1,3]. This deletion causes a frameshift generating a
predicted translated product of 181 amino acid residues (153 from the
protein and 28 novel amino acids before the stop codon) [2]. 22 other 
mutations, including deletions, insertions and point mutations, have been
reported [1,3]. It has been suggested that such mutations result in severely
truncated CLN3 proteins, or affect its structure/conformation [1,3]. CLN3
has no known function.

CLN3 proteins, which are believed to associate in complexes, are heavily
glycosylated lysosomal membrane proteins [2], containing complex Asn-linked
oligosaccharides [4]. Extensive glycosylation is important for the stability
of these lysosomal proteins in the highly hydrolytic lysosomal lumen. CLN3
protein contains four potential N-glycosylation sites (residues 49, 71, 85
and 310), two putative O-glycosylation sites (residues 80 and 256), and two
potential glycosaminoglycan sites (residues 162 and 168) [2]. Lysosomal
membranes are involved in acidification of the lysosomal matrix,
sequestration of active lysosomal enzymes, transport of degraded molecules
from the lysosomes, and fusion and fission between lysosomes and other
organelles [2]. 

The CLN3 protein is a 43Kd, highly hydrophobic, multi-transmembrane (TM),
phosphorylated protein [2]. Hydrophobicity analysis predicts 6-9 TM
segments, suggesting that CLN3 is a TM protein that may function as a
chaperone or signal transducer [5]. The majority of putative phosphorylation
sites are found in the N-terminal domain, encompassing 150 residues [5].
Phosphorylation is believed to be important for membrane compartment 
interaction, in the formation of functional complexes, and in regulation 
and interactions with other proteins [6]. 

CLN3 contains several motifs that may undergo lipid post-translational
modifications (PTMs). PTMs contribute to targeting and anchoring of modified
proteins to distinct biological membranes [7]. There are three general 
classes of lipid modification: N-terminal myristoylation, C-terminal 
prenylation, and palmitoylation of cysteine residues. Such modifications 
are believed to be a common form of PTM occurring in 0.5% of all cellular
proteins, including brain tissue [8]. The C-terminus of the CLN3 contains
various lipid modification sites: C435, target for prenylation; G419, 
target for myristoylation; and C414, target for palmitoylation [8,9].
Prenylation results in protein hydrophobicity, influences interaction with
upstream regulatory proteins and downstream effectors, facilitates protein-
protein interaction (multisubunit assembly) and promotes anchoring to
membrane lipids [8]. The prenylation motif, Cys-A-A-X, is highly conserved
within CLN3 protein sequences of different species [8].

In normal human tissue, protein immunoblotting indicates presence of CLN3
in the brain, pancreas, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, placenta,
and testis, with detectable amounts in the peripheral nerve [2,10]. CLN3
mRNA expression is found to be little in the brain and considerably greater
in pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver and lung [10]. The difference 
in distribution of CLN3 mRNA and protein is believed to be a result of
post-transcriptional regulation of the CLN3 gene [10]. CLN3 in the brain is
found in both grey and white matter, with greater concentrations in the
former and localised in astrocytes and neurons. In the pancreas, it is found
in pancreatic islets and peripheral nerves [10]. The subcelluar distribution
of CLN3 is localised to membranes and nuclei [10]. Previous studies also
indicate presence of CLN3 in the mitochondrial membrane or lysosomes [9,11].

Species with known CLN3 protein homologues include: Homo sapiens, Canis 
familiaris, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila
melanogaster.

BATTENIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
CLN3 Batten's disease protein. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 9 encode
putative TM regions, motif 9 containing prenylation, myristoylation and 
palmitoylation lipid modification sites. Two iterations on SPTR37.10f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 8 
sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also found: O95086
and O95089 are human CLN3 splice variants; and O76703 is a C.elegans
cosmid that bears similarities to CLN3 protein.
