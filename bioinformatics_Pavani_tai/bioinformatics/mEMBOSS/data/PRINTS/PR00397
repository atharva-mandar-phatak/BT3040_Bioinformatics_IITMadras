SIROHAEM
Nitrite reductases and bacterial sulphite reductases catalyse the 
6-electron reduction of nitrite (sulphite) to ammonia (sulphide) [1,2].
On the basis of physiological function, 2 types of nitrite reductase
can be defined: the assimilatory type, which is involved in nitrate
assimilation (denitrification); and the dissimilatory type, which is 
responsible for nitrate respiration function. Assimilatory nitrite
reductases contain a prosthetic group termed sirohaem (an iron tetra- 
hydroporphyrin of the isobacteriochlorin type, with 8 carboxylic acid-
containing peripheral sidechains), and an iron-sulphur cluster.   

Similarly, there are 2 types of sulphite reductase: the assimilatory type,
which participate in the synthesis of sulphur-containing compounds; and
the dissimilatory type, which are terminal reductases in the reduction of
sulphate. Assimilatory sulphite reductases can catalyse 6-electron
reduction without the formation of free intermediates, while dissimilatory
reductases can produce trithionate and thiosulphate in addition to sulphide.
Both types of reductase contain sirohaem and iron-sulphur clusters [2]. 

A region of sequence similarity, about 80 amino acids long, is shared by 
assimilatory nitrite [1] and sulphite reductases [3,4]. Four conserved Cys
residues are suggested to be involved in binding the sirohaem group and/or
the iron-sulphur center [3].

SIROHAEM is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
sirohaem-Fe binding site. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs include the first and last pair of
4 conserved Cys residues, respectively - motif 2 includes the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern NIR_SIR (PS00365). Two iterations on OWL25.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
15 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 45 sequences.
