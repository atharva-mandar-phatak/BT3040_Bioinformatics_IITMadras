MTLDHDRGNASE
Mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase catalyses the NAD-dependent reduction
of mannitol-1-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate [1] as part of the
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) [2]. The PTS
facilitates the vectorial translocation of metabolisable carbohydrates to
form the corresponding sugar phosphates, which are then converted to 
glycolytic intermediates [2]. Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase catalyses the 
NAD-dependent reduction of mannitol to fructose [3]. The E.coli yeiQ
protein shares sequence similarity with these 2 types of dehydrogenase,
suggesting an evolutionary relationship.

MTLDHDRGNASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
mannitol dehydrogenases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in
the first half of the alignment, motif 1 including a putative NAD-binding
site, and motif 3 containing the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
MANNITOL_DHGENASE (PS00974). Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, ECMTLD1, an E.coli
mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase that fails to make significant matches
with motifs 2 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences, and 1
partial match.
