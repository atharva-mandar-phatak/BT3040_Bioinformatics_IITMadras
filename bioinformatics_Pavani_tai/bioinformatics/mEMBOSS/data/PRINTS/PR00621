HISTONEH2B
Histone H2B is a small, highly conserved nuclear protein that, together
with 2 molecules each of histones H2A, H3 and H4, forms the eukaryotic
nucleosome core [1]; the nucleosome octamer winds ~146 DNA base-pairs.

HISTONEH2B is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
H2B histones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
20 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length - motifs 3-5 include the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern HISTONE_H2B (PS00357). Two iterations on OWL29.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 95
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 105 sequences, and 1
partial match.
