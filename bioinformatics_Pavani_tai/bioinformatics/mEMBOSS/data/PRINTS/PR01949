INTLKN15FISH
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including 
stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [1]. It is 
required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype, a process that
is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [2]. The numbers of CD8+ memory T cells
in animals may, therefore, be controlled by a balance between IL-15 and -2.

IL-15 has been identified in mammals, birds and fish. Recombinant fish IL-15
has been shown to stimulate splenic leukocytes, inducing a large increase 
in the expression of the antiviral, immunoregulatory cytokine, interferon-
gamma [3].

INTLKN15FISH is is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
fish interleukin-15. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
C-terminal two thirds of the alignment. A single iteration on SPTR55_38f was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond
the starting set.
