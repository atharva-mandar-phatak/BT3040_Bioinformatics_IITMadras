BCHLROPHYLLC
Chlorosomes, which are attached to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic
membrane, consist of 4 polypeptides and associated pigments and lipids.
The principal light-harvesting pigment of the green filamentous bacterium
Chloroflexus aurantiacus is bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) c. This pigment is
either bound to, or constrained by, a small approximately 80-residue
polypeptide designated Bchlc-binding protein. In C.aurantiacus, a C-terminal
extension is believed to play a role in proper incorporation of the protein
during chlorosome assembly [1]. The protein has a high degree of similarity
to Bchlc-binding proteins of other photosynthetic bacteria.

BCHLROPHYLLC is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bacteriochlorophyll C binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs span the full alignment
length. A single iteration on OWL29.1 was required to reach convergence, 
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
