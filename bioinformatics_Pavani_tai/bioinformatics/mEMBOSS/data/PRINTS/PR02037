FLIPR
Formyl Peptide Receptor-Like 1 (FPRL1)-inhibitory protein (also termed
FLIPr) has been shown to inhibit calcium mobilisation in neutrophils [1].
There is evidence that FLIPr binds to FPRL1 and, at higher concentrations, 
to FPR [1], impairing the leukocyte response to FPRL1 agonists. It has
revealed unknown inflammatory ligands during S.aureus infection and, as an
FPRL1 antagonist, may facilitate development of therapeutic agents in
FPRL1-mediated inflammatory diseases [1].

FLIPR is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for FPRL1
inhibitory proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 37 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
FPRL1 N- and C-terminal fragments.
