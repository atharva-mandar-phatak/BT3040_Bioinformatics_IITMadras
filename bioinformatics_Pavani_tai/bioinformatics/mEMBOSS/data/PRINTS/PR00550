HYPRGLYCEMIC
Hyperglycemic hormone, which controls blood sugar levels, is an abundant
peptide in the sinus glands of isopods and decapods [1,2]. The peptide is a
potent secretagogue, releasing digestive enzymes from the hepatopancreas.
It may act as a stress hormone. The peptide contains around 70 amino acid
residues, and includes 6 cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond
formation [2]. The sequences show a high degree of similarity to the
American lobster molt-inhibiting hormone [3], which also shows hyper-
glycemic hormone activity.

Sequence analysis reveals at least 2 discrete sequence families,
characterised by distinctive N- and C-terminal signatures: broadly, the
families represent separate groups of the crustacean hyperglycemic-like
hormones and the molt-inhibiting-like hormones. The positions of 5 of the
6 cysteine residues are conserved between these families, the first Cys
being displaced by one residue position.

HYPRGLYCEMIC is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hyperglycemic hormone family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the central portion of the alignment and encode 5 of 6 conserved
cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond formation. Two iterations on
OWL27.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 14 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 27 sequences.
