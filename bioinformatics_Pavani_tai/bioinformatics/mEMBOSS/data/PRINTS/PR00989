ADENOKINASE
Adenosine kinase (ADK) phosphorylates adenosine and other related nucleosides
[1,2]. It is exclusive to eukaryotes [3] and is a key enzyme in the purine
salvage pathway.

ADK catalyses the reaction:

		  Adenosine + ATP = ADP + AMP	     [1]

This reaction prevents toxic levels of adenosine building up within the
cell. Experiments have been carried out on chick embryonic neurons to
document the toxicity of adenosine, and the associated requirement for ADK.
[4]

Adenosine and ATP have been connected with pain, and the control of pain
[5,6]. Associated with this, adenosine has also been shown to have a number
of anti-inflammatory activities [7].

Human ADK bears little sequence similarity to other mammalian nucleoside
kinases, but does share high similarity with some microbrial ribokinases and
fructokinases, suggesting possible evolutionary connections [1,2].

ADENOKINASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
adenosine kinases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
alignment N- and C-termini. Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 12 sequences was 
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences.
