ARRESTIN
Arrestin (retinal S-antigen) is a major protein of the retinal rod outer
segments. It interacts with photo-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin, 
inhibiting or 'arresting' its ability to interact with transducin [1]. The
protein binds calcium, and shows similarity in its C-terminus to alpha-
transducin and other purine nucleotide-binding proteins. In mammals, 
arrestin is associated with autoimmune uveitis. 

Arrestins comprise a family of closely related proteins that includes:
beta-arrestin-1 and -2, which regulate the function of beta-adrenergic
receptors by binding to their phosphorylated forms, impairing their
capacity to activate G(S) proteins; and Drosophila phosrestins I and II,
which undergo light-induced phosphorylation, and probably play a role in
photoreceptor transduction [2-4].

ARRESTIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
arrestins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length, and contain many charged and hydrophobic residues - motif
2 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern ARRESTINS (PS00295). Two
iterations on OWL22.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 17 sequences was identified. A single partial match was
also found, a phosrestin II fragment.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 31 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
