MACROMOMYCIN
Macromomycin, the apoprotein of the anti-tumour antibiotic auromomycin,
is a single-chain polypeptide of 112 amino-acid residues cross-linked
by two intramolecular disulphide bonds. Comparison of the structures
of macromomycin, actinoxanthin and neocarzinostatin suggests that they
belong to a family of related proteins [1].

The 3D structure of macromomycin has been determined to 1.6A resolution
by means of X-ray crystallography [2]. The fold comprises a flattened 7-
stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel and two anti-parallel beta-sheet 
ribbons. The barrel and ribbons define a deep cleft that forms the 
chromophore binding site [2]. Highly specific side chains extend into this 
cleft and may be important to the chromophore-binding specificity. The 
chromophore binds to DNA as a weak intercalator and causes single- and 
double-strand breaks.

The solution structure of the closely-related neocarzinostatin, which
has antibiotic activity for Gram-positive bacteria and anti-tumour 
activity for certain mouse tumours, has been determined by NMR-
spectroscopy [3]. A similar beta-barrel fold was revealed for the 
carrier protein, the chromophore being tightly enwrapped and thus 
shielded from exposure to the solvent [3]. A possible mechanism for
exposure or release of the active principle may be via subtle 
environmental changes, such as in pH [3].

MACROMOMYCIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the macromomycin family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 encodes beta-
strand 1 and the following beta-turn; motif 2 spans strand 3 and the
preceding turn; motif 3 encodes strand 6 and the preceding turn; and
motif 4 spans strand 8 and its preceding and following beta-turns. 
A single iteration on SPTR41_24f was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
