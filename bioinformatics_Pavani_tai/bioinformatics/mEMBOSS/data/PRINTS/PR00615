CCAATSUBUNTA
The CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) is a mammalian transcription factor that
binds to a CCAAT motif in the promoters of a wide variety of genes,
including type I collagen and albumin [1,2]. The factor is a heteromeric
complex of A and B subunits, both of which are required for DNA-binding
[1,2]. The subunits can interact in the absence of DNA-binding, conserved
regions in each being important in mediating this interaction.

The A subunit can be split into 3 domains on the basis of sequence
similarity: a non-conserved N-terminal 'A domain'; a highly-conserved
central 'B domain' involved in DNA-binding; and a C-terminal 'C domain',
which contains a number of glutamine and acidic residues involved in
protein-protein interactions [2]. The A subunit shows striking similarity
to the HAP3 subunit of the yeast CCAAT-binding heterotrimeric transcription
factor [2,4]. The K.lactis HAP3 protein has been predicted to contain a
4-cysteine zinc finger, which is thought to be present in similar HAP3
and CBF subunit A proteins, in which the third cysteine is replaced by a
serine [4].

CCAATSUBUNTA is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
CCAAT-binding transcription factor A subunit. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the
full length of the B domain, motif 1 including the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern CBFA_NFYB (PS00685), which is involved in DNA-binding. Two
iterations on OWL28.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 44 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
