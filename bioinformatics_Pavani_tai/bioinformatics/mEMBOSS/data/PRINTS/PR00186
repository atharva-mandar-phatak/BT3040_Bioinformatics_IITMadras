HEMERYTHRIN
Marine invertebrates possess 2 different types of oxygen-binding protein:
porphyrin-containing pigments, such as haemoglobin; and hemerythrin,
found in the vascular system and coelemic fluid, or in muscles (myohem-
erythrin) [1]. The active centre of both proteins is a binuclear iron
complex, bound directly to the protein via 7 amino acid side chains [2], 
5 His, 1 Glu and 1 Asp [1]. Hemerythrins comprise left-twisted 4-alpha-
helical bundles, which provide a hydrophobic pocket where dioxygen binds
as a peroxo species, interacting with adjacent aliphatic side chains via
van der Waals forces [2]. The leech yolk protein, ovohemerythrin, is 
another family member, possibly playing a role in the detoxification 
of free iron after a blood meal [3].

HEMERYTHRIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hemerythrins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: motif 1 is drawn from a well-conserved N-terminal region; and
motifs 2, 3 and 4 include parts of helices 1, 3 and 4, which contain the
Asp, Tyr and 4 His residues involved in binding the binuclear iron cluster
- motif 4 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern HEMERYTHRINS
(PS00550). Two iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 20 sequences was identified. Eight
partial matches were also found, all of which are hemerythrin fragments
from crystallographic studies.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
