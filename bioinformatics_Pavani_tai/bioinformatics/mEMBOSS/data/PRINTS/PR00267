INTFRNREGFCT
The expression of type I interferon genes (interferons alpha and beta) is 
induced by many agents, including viral attack [1]. Induction is mediated
by the binding of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) to a region known
as the interferon consensus sequence (ICS), located upstream of the
interferon genes [2]. Other factors may also bind to the ICS, including
IRF-2, which does not function as an activator, but rather suppresses the
function of IRF-1 under certain circumstances [3]. IRF proteins contain a
conserved N-terminal region of about 120 amino acids, which folds into a
structure that binds specifically to the ICS; the remaining parts of the
sequences vary depending on the precise function of the protein [2]. 

INTFRNREGFCT is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
ICS-binding region of interferon regulatory factors. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full length of the binding
domain, motif 4 including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern IRF
(PS00601). Two iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 29 sequences.
