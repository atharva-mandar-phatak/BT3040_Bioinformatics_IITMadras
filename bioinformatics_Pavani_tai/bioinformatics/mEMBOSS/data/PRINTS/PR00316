ENTEROVIROMP
The ability to invade eukaryotic cells is a property possessed by many
pathogenic bacteria [1]. This process is facilitated by bacterial so-called
virulence outer membrane proteins [1]. Although situated in the membrane, 
the protein sequences show no long hydrophobic domains consistent with the 
presence of transmembrane (TM) helices (except in the N-terminal signal
sequence) [2]. It has therefore been proposed that the proteins possess 8
membrane-spanning beta-strands, each with 9 or 10 residues [2].

ENTEROVIROMP is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
enterobacterial virulence outer membrane proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: motif 1 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern ENT_VIR_OMP_1 (PS00694), which spans the
second putative TM beta-strand; motif 2 spans the fourth and fifth putative
beta-strands; motif 3 the sixth and seventh; and motif 4 includes the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern ENT_VIR_OMP_2 (PS00695), which spans the eighth
strand. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
