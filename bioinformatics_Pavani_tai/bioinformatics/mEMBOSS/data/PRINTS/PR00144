DALDHYDRTASE
Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase catalyses the second stage of the
biosynthesis of haem, i.e. the condensation of 2 molecules of 5-amino-
levulinate to form porphobilinogen [1]. The enzyme is an oligomer of 8
identical subunits, each of which binds a zinc or magnesium (plants)
atom. A lysine residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism [2].  

DALDHYDRTASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratases. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 4 including
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern D_ALA_DEHYDRATASE (PS00169), which
contains the conserved catalytic lysine. Two iterations on OWL25.2 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 31 sequences.
