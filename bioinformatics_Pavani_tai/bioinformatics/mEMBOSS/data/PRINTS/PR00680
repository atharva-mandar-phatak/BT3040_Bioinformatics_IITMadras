PTREFOIL
The P-type trefoil or P-domain is a 45-residue cysteine-rich region, 
6 cysteines of which link together through 3 disulphide bonds with
connectivity 1-5, 2-4, 3-6, thus:

             +-------------------------+
             |         +--------------+|
             |         |              ||
           xxCxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxCxxxxCCxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxx
                                 |                |
                                 |                |
                                 +----------------+

The domain has been found in a variety of extracellular eukaryotic
proteins [1-3].

PTREFOIL is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for P-type
trefoil domains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions in the
central portion of the alignment and span the full domain length - motifs 
1 and 2 include the region encoded by PROSITE pattern P_TREFOIL (PS00025),
which encodes the central 4 cysteine residues. Two iterations on OWL29.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
20 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
