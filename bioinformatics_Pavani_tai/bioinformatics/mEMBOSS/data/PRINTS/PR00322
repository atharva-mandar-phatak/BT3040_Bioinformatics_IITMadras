G10
G10 is a hydrophilic protein containing 143-157 residues, whose C-terminus
is rich in cysteine residues [1]. The function of G10 is unknown, but the 
amino acid sequence is highly conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic 
species, and the Cys-rich region could be involved in metal binding. 

G10 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for G10 proteins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from the full alignment length, motifs 4 and 5 including
the Cys-rich regions encoded by PROSITE patterns G10_1 (PS00997) and G10_2
(PS00998). Two iterations on OWL23.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences.
