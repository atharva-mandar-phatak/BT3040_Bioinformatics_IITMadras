NONHISHMG17
High mobility group (HMG) proteins constitute a family of relatively low 
molecular weight non-histone components in chromatin. HMG14 and HMG17 are
highly-similar proteins of about 100 amino acid residues; the sequence of
chicken HMG14 is almost as similar to chicken HMG17 as it is to mammalian
HMG14 polypeptides [1]. The proteins bind to the inner side of the nucleo-
somal DNA, altering the interaction between the DNA and the histone octamer
[1,2]. It is thought that they may be involved in the process that confers
specific chromatin conformations to transcribable regions in the genome [3].

H6 (histone T) is a basic non-histone protein isolated from the chromatin of
rainbow trout [4]. Protein H6 possesses 69 residues and, in spite of its 
shorter length, shows considerable similarities to the 89-residue calf 
thymus HMG17 protein family [4].

NONHISHMG17 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
non-histone chromosomal HMG-17 protein family. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
short conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified. Two partial matches
were also found: HG17_BOVIN is a bovine non-histone chromosomal protein 
whose sequence is poorly defined in the region of motif 4; and HSU90549 
is a human non-histone chromosomal protein that fails to make a significant
match with motif 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
