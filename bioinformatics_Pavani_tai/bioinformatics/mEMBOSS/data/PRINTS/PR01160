GABAARBETA
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are members of the neurotransmitter
ligand-gated ion channels: they mediate neuronal inhibition by opening 
chloride channels on binding GABA [1,2]. There are 5 classes of receptor
subunit (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and rho), with variants in each class
[3]. Each subunit contains 4 proposed transmembrane (TM) domains, with a
large intracellular loop between the third and fourth domain. Active
receptors contain 5 subunits of varying classes and variants - the use
of highly similar receptor subtypes, which differ in functionality, is a
common feature of brain receptors [3].

The neurotransmitter action of the subtype A receptor (GABAA) is
potentiated by both benzodiazepines and barbiturates [3]. Alpha subunits
largely determine benzodiazepine binding properties [4], and gamma-2
subunits appear to be essential for benzodiazepine modulation of receptor
function [1]. In insects, cyclodiene (an insecticide) resistence is due to
insensitivity of the cyclodiene/picrotoxinin binding site on the GABAA
receptor-chloride ionophore complex [5].

A cDNA encoding the human GABAA receptor beta 2 subunit has been cloned and
sequenced [6]. Expression of recombinant human GABAA receptors containing
different beta subunits (beta 1, beta 2 or beta 3) in both transfected
cells and Xenopus oocytes, has revealed the influence of the beta subunit on
the pharmacology of the receptor. For a number of benzodiazepine binding
site compounds, a barbiturate, and several neurosteroids, neither the
affinity nor the efficacy of the compounds is influenced by the type of
beta subunit present in the receptor molecule [6]. These observations
suggest that the beta subunit does not significantly influence the
benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or steroid site pharmacologies of human GABAA
receptor subtypes [6].

GABAARBETA is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for GABAA
beta subunit precursors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise the beta subunits but distinguish them from 
the rest of the GABA receptor superfamily - motifs 1 and 2 lie within the
putative N-terminal extracellular domain; motif 3 encodes part of TM domain
3; and motif 4 lies at the C-terminus of the probable cytoplasmic domain.
Three iterations on SPTR37_9f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 19 sequences was identified. Several partial
matches were also found, which are largely GABA pi and rho subunits or 
glycine receptors that match 2 motifs.
