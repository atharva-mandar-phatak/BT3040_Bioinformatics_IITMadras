CD44
CD44 is a polymorphic cell-surface glycoprotein synthesised in a variety
of cells. The protein interacts with actin-based cytoskeletons, and co-
localises with ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin and moesin) at actin filament-
plasma membrane interaction sites [1]. CD44 may be involved in cell 
migration, adhesion and differentiation in normal cells, as well as in
metastasis in cancer cells. It is a receptor for extracellular materials,
such as soluble or cell-bound hyaluronic acid, collagen, fibronectin and
serglycin. The protein has a single membrane-spanning domain and has a
heavily glycosylated extracellular domain; its cytoplasmic domain is
reportedly associated with an ankyrin-like protein [1].

CD44 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the CD44
antigen precursor. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: motifs 1-4 were drawn from conserved regions spanning
the N-terminal portion of the alignment; motifs 5 and 6 encode the membrane-
spanning domain; and motifs 7 and 8 lie in the C-terminal domain, which 
associates with ERM proteins. Two iterations on OWL29.1 were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 24 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are 
fragments or CD44 homologues.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences, and 1
partial match.
