KIR12CHANNEL
Potassium channels are found in virtually all cell types. Their pore-
forming subunits fall into three structural families, i.e. those possessing
six, four and two transmembrane (TM) domains. The six-TM domain K+ channels
can be further subdivided into six families: the voltage-gated K+ channels
(Kv), the KCNQ channels, the eag-like K+ channels, and three Ca2+-activated
K+ channels. Inwardly-rectifying K+ channels (Kir) are the principal class
of two-TM domain K+ channels, and the recently-discovered two-pore domain
K+ channels, make up a family of four-TM domain K+ channels.

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are responsible for regulating
diverse processes including: cellular excitability, vascular tone, heart
rate, renal salt flow, and insulin release [1]. To date, around twenty
members of this superfamily have been cloned, which can be grouped into six
families by sequence similarity - these are designated Kir1.x-7.x [2,3].

Cloned Kir channel cDNAs encode proteins of between ~370-500 residues,
containing two predicted TM domains, with the characteristic K+ channel
pore-forming domain located between them. Both N- and C-termini are thought
to be cytoplasmic, and the N-terminus lacks a signal sequence. It is thought
that four Kir subunits assemble to form a tetrameric channel complex, which
may be hetero- or homomeric [1].

The Kir1.2 channel (also known as Kir4.1, ROMK2, BIR10, KAB-2 and BIRK1)
is found principally in the brain, where it is widely distributed. It has
also been found on satellite cells of the rat cochlear ganglia, and at
low levels within the kidney. Kir1.2 channel activity is dependent upon
phosphorylation-state, with two serine residues within the C-terminus,
likely the target of PKA protein kinase A, being involved [4]. Kir1.2 has
recently been shown to interact with a novel PDZ domain-containing protein,
CIPP [5].

KIR12CHANNEL is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
Kir1.2 inward rectifier K+ channel. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise Kir1.2 but distinguish it from other subtypes -
motifs 1-3 encode portions of the putative cytoplasmic N-terminus; and
motifs 4-7 lie in the cytoplasmic C-terminus. A single iteration on 
SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.
