BASIGIN
The basigins are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. They are 
present on the surface of tumour cells and stimulate nearby fibroblasts to
synthesise matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which play an important role in
tumour invasiveness and metastasis [1]. Basigin has also been repeatedly 
implicated in the proper function of the blood brain barrier [2,3]. In
addition, the protein is essential for fertility in both males and females
[4]. In males, it is required for the completion of spermatogenesis, while
in females, it is needed for maintaining normal reproductive functions.

Basigins are highly glycosylated membrane proteins, the degree of
glycosylation varying with tissue type. The extracellular region of basigin
contains two randomly arranged Ig domains: an Ig-like C2-type domain and an
Ig-like V-domain [5]. 

BASIGIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
basigins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions within the
N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 1 resides within the N-terminal
signal prepeptide; motif 2 falls within the extracellular Ig-like C2-type
domain; motif 3 lies in the extracellular region between the two Ig domains;
and motifs 4-6 reside in the extracellular Ig-like V-type domain. A single
iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence, no further 
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
