JDOMAIN
DnaJ, a prokaryotic heat shock protein, interacts with dnaK, a chaperone
hsp70-like protein [1]. DnaJ comprises a 70-residue N-terminal domain
(the J-domain); a 30-residue glycine-rich region (the G-domain); a central
domain containing 4 repeats of a CxxCxGxG motif (the CRR-domain); and a
120-170 residue C-terminal region. 

The J- and CRR-domains are found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic
proteins [2], either together or separately: e.g., those containing both
J- and CRR-domains include yeast proteins MAS5/YDJ1, MDJ1, SCJ1, XDJ1 and
YNL077w, plant dnaJ homologues from leek and cucumber, and human HDJ2; 
those with only the J-domain include R.fredii nolC, E.coli cbpA [3], yeast
proteins  SEC63/NPL1, SIS1, CAJ1, YFR041c, YIR004w and YJL162c, P.falciparum 
ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, human HDJ1 and HSJ1, and 
Drosophila cysteine-string protein.

JDOMAIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature the DnaJ
domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 49
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the
full length of the J domain - motif 4 encompasses the C-terminal end of the
J domain and part of the following Gly-rich region. Fourteen iterations on 
SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 4,344 sequences was identified. Numerous partial matches were
also found, all of which are presumed to be family members that fail to make
significant matches with one or more motifs.
