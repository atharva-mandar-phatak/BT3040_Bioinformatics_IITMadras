PDIESTERASE1
Retinal 3',5'-cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) is located in photoreceptor
outer segments [1]: it is light activated, playing a pivotal role in
signal transduction. In rod cells, PDE is oligomeric, comprising an
alpha-, a beta- and 2 gamma-subunits, while in cones, PDE is a homodimer
of alpha chains, which are associated with several smaller subunits.
Both rod and cone PDEs catalyse the hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP to the
corresponding nucleoside 5' monophosphates, both enzymes also binding
cGMP with high affinity. The cGMP-binding sites are located in the
N-terminal half of the protein sequence, while the catalytic core 
resides in the C-terminal portion. 

PDIESTERASE1 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
short conserved regions within the catalytic core in the C-terminal
half of the alignment. Three iterations on OWL26.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 51 sequences
was identified. Several partial matches were also found, largely
fragments and C-terminal truncations lacking one or more of the motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 50 sequences, and 16
partial matches.
