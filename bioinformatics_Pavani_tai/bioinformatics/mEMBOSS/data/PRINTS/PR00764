COMPLEMENTC9
Complement component C9 is a multi-domain protein that contains an
N-terminal type-1 TSP domain, an LDL-receptor class A repeat, a number of
potential transmembrane (TM) regions and a C-terminal EGF-like domain [1-3].
Hydropathy analysis of the sequence indicates the N-terminal half of C9 to
be predominantly hydrophilic in character, while the C-terminal section
is more hydrophobic. The amphipathic organisation of the primary structure
is consistent with the known potential of polymerised C9 to penetrate lipid
bilayers, causing the formation of transmembrane channels [3,4]. 

COMPLEMENTC9 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
complement C9 family of proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 lies within the
N-terminal type-1 TSP motif; motif 2 was drawn from the LDL-receptor
class A repeat; motif 3 spans part of the first putative TM domain and
includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern MAC_PERFORIN (PS00279);
and motif 6 lies in the C-terminal EGF-like region. Two iterations on
OWL29.4 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 18 sequences was identified. A single partial match was found,
C8B_RAT, a complement C8 beta chain fragment that lacks the first 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
