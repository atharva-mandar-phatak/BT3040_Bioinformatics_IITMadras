G6PISOMERASE
Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) catalyses the reversible isomerisation of
glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate [1,2]. The enzyme is dimeric
and is involved in a number of pathways: e.g., glycolysis in higher
organisms; gluconeogenesis in mammals; carbohydrate biosynthesis in plants;
and provides a gateway for fructose into the Entner-Doudouroff pathway in
some bacteria. PGI is identical in sequence to neuroleukin, a neurotrophic
factor that supports survival of certain neurons [3].

G6PISOMERASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
glucose-6-phosphate isomerases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning the central and C-terminal portions of the alignment -
motifs 2 and 6 include the regions encoded by PROSITE patterns P_GLUCOSE_
ISOMERASE_1 (PS00765) and P_GLUCOSE_ISOMERASE_2 (PS00174) respectively. 
Two iterations on OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 38 sequences was identified. Several partial
matches were also found, including a number of fragments and more distant
relatives that fail to make significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 58 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
