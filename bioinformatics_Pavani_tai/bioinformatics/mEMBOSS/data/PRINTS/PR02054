FAM175PLANT
Members of protein family FAM175 include the BRCA1-A complex subunit 
Abraxas [1,2], BRISC complex subunit Abro1 (Abraxas brother protein 1)
[3,4], and an uncharacterised protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

Sequences of the Arabidopsis proteins share strong resemblance to the
Abraxas and Abro1 proteins, largely within the MPN-like domain [4].

FAM175PLANT is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
plant protein family FAM175. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections 
that characterise the plant protein family FAM175 sequences but distinguish
them from the rest of protein family FAM175. A single iteration on
SPTR57.15_40.15f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are plant sequences that fail to make significant
matches with two or more motifs.
