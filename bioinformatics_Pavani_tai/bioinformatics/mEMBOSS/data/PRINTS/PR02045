F138DOMAIN
A number of genes are expressed exclusively in the retina, where they appear
to control the specialised functions of various different cell types [1].
One of these retinal genes (termed FAM138A/B/C/F) is found within a 
region of subtelomeric DNA and exhibits polymorphic distribution among
multiple chromosomes [1]. This gene encodes a putative 85-amino acid 
polypeptide (F379) that shares a high level of similarity with the retinal
protein FAM138D; both also include a well-conserved N-terminal domain
that is shared by a wide range of proteins, including podocalyxin-like
protein 1, proto-oncogene c-Rel, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 homologue,
and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19.

F138DOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
FAM138 N-terminal domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 17 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the complete domain. Five iterations on SPTR57.15_40.15f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 117
sequences was identified. Numerous partial matches were also found, all
of which appear to be homologues that fail to make significant matches with
one of the motifs.
