FRIZZLED
The frizzled (fz) locus of Drosophila coordinates the cytoskeletons of
epidermal cells, producing a parallel array of cuticular hairs and bristles
[1,2]. In fz mutants, the orientation of individual hairs with respect both
to their neighbours and to the organism as a whole is altered - in the wild-
type wing, all hairs point towards the distal tip [1]. In the developing
wing, fz has 2 functions: it is required for the proximal-distal
transmission of an intracellular polarity signal; and it is required for
cells to respond to the polarity signal.

Fz produces an mRNA that encodes an integral membrane protein with 7
putative transmembrane (TM) domains. This protein should contain both
extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, which could function in the
transmission and interpretation of polarity information [1]. 

FRIZZLED is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for frizzled
proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from the 7 putative TM regions. Two
iterations on OWL27.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified. A single partial match
was also found, a frizzled protein fragment lacking the last 3 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 25 sequences, and 1
partial match.
