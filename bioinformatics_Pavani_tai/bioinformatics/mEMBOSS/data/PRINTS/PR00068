CUZNDISMTASE
Superoxide dismutases are ubiquitous metalloproteins that prevent damage
by oxygen-mediated free radicals by catalysing the dismutation of superoxide
into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [1]. Superoxide is a normal 
by-product of aerobic respiration and is produced by a number of reactions, 
including oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis [2]. The dismutase
enzymes have a very high catalytic efficiency due to the attraction of
superoxide to the ions bound at the active site [3].

There are 3 forms of superoxide dismutase, depending on the metal cofactor: 
Cu/Zn (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types. The Fe and Mn
forms are similar in their primary, secondary and tertiary structures, but 
are distinct from the Cu/Zn form [4]. Prokaryotes and protists contain Mn,
Fe or both types, while most eukaryotic organisms utilise the Cu/Zn type.

CUZNDISMTASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs line the active site, 1 and 4 including
regions encoded by PROSITE patterns SOD_CU_ZN_1 (PS00087) and SOD_CU_ZN_2
(PS00332), the former containing 2 His residues involved in binding the Cu
ion, and the latter a Cys residue involved in disulphide bond formation. Two
iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a 
true set comprising 66 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 97 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
