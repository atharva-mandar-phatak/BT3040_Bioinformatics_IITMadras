PPTHIESTRASE
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) represent a group of encephalopathies
that occur in 1 in 12,500 children [1]. The diseases are divided into 3 main
subtypes, of which the infantile type (INCL) is characterised by early
visual loss and rapidly-progressing mental deterioration. Death usually
occurs at 8-11 years, and characteristic storage bodies are found in the
brain and other tissues at autopsy. Although the molecular pathogenesis
underlying the disease is unknown, defects in the palmitoyl-protein
thioesterase (PPT) gene have recently been reported in a group of INCL
patients [1]. The most common mutation results in intracellular
accumulation of the polypeptide and undetectable enzyme activity in
the brain.

Direct sequencing of cDNAs derived from brain RNA of INCL patients has
shown a mis-sense transversion of A to T at nucleotide position 364, which
results in substitution of Trp for Arg at position 122 in the protein - 
Arg 122 is immediately adjacent to a lipase consensus sequence that 
contains the putative active site Ser of PPT. The occurrence of this and
2 other independent mutations in the PPT gene strongly suggests that
defects in this gene cause INCL [1]. 

PPTHIESTRASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
palmitoyl protein thioesterases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 3 spans the lipase
consensus sequence, which contains the putative active-site serine, and
includes Arg 122. A single iteration on OWL26.3 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences, and 1
partial match.
