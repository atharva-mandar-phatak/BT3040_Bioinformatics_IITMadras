TRNSTHYRETIN
Transthyretin (formerly prealbumin) is one of 3 thyroid hormone-binding
proteins found in the blood of vertebrates [1]. It is produced in the liver
and circulates in the bloodstream, where it binds retinol and thyroxine
(T4) [2]. It differs from the other 2 hormone-binding proteins (T4-binding
globulin and albumin) in 3 distinct ways: (1) the gene is expressed at a
high rate in the brain choroid plexus; (2) it is enriched in cerebrospinal 
fluid; and (3) no genetically caused absence has been observed, suggesting 
an essential role in brain function, distinct from that played in the blood-
stream [1]. The protein consists of around 130 amino acids, which assemble 
as a homotetramer that contains an internal channel in which T4 is bound
[1]. Within this complex, T4 appears to be transported across the blood-
brain barrier, where, in the choroid plexus, the hormone stimulates further
synthesis of transthyretin: the protein then diffuses back into the blood-
stream, where it binds T4 for transport back to the brain [1].  

TRNSTHYRETIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
transthyretins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs correspond to highly conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length, 1 and 4 including N- and C-terminal domains encoded
by PROSITE patterns TRANSTHYRETIN_1 (PS00768) and TRANSTHYRETIN_2 (PS00769),
both of which contain residues known to bind T4 (in the former a Lys
residue, and in the latter a Ser-Thr dipeptide). Two iterations on OWL21.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, both of
which lack motifs 1 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
