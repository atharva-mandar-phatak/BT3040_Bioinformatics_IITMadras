ADRENOMEDULN
Adrenomedullin is a hypotensive peptide, first identified in human 
pheochromocytoma arising from adrenal medulla [1,2]. The protein is ~185 
amino acids in length, and includes a 21-residue putative N-terminal signal 
sequence [2]. The active peptide, which is expressed in adrenal glands, lung,
kidney, heart, spleen, duodenum and submandibular glands, is thought to
function as a hormone in circulation control. 

The adrenomedullin precursor is believed to contain 2 cleavage sites, one
of which produces the active adrenomedullin hormone, and the other, a
20-residue peptide (proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide, or proam-n20)
of unknown function [3].

ADRENOMEDULN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
adrenomedullins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length - motif 1 spans the signal peptide; motif 2 includes part
of the proam-n20 sequence; motifs 4-7 span the adrenomedullin peptide; and
motif 8 lies at the C-terminus. A single iteration on OWL30.0 was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences, and 1
partial match.
