FAM138ABCDF
A number of genes are expressed exclusively in the retina, where they appear
to control the specialised functions of various different cell types [1].
One of these retinal genes (termed FAM138A/B/C/F) is found within a 
region of subtelomeric DNA and exhibits polymorphic distribution among
multiple chromosomes [1]. This gene encodes a putative 85-amino acid 
polypeptide (F379) that shares a high level of similarity with the retinal
protein FAM138D; both also include a well-conserved N-terminal domain
that is shared by a wide range of proteins, including podocalyxin-like
protein 1, proto-oncogene c-Rel, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 homologue,
and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19.

FAM138ABCDF is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
retina specific protein F379 family. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on
SPTR57.15_40.15f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set.
