HIVTATDOMAIN
Like other lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
encodes a trans-activating regulatory protein (Tat), which is needed
for efficient transcription of the viral genome [1,2]. Tat acts by
binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response
element (TAR), found at the 5' ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts. In
binding to TAR, Tat alters the properties of the transcription complex,
enhancing transcriptional initiation and hence increasing the production
of full-length viral RNA [2]. Tat is essential for HIV-1 replication,
making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development.

The minimum Tat sequence that can mediate specific TAR binding in vitro
has been mapped to a basic domain of 10 amino acids, comprising mostly
Arg and Lys residues. Regulatory activity, however, also requires the 47
N-terminal residues, which interact with components of the transcription
complex and function as a transcriptional activation domain [2-4]. 

HIVTATDOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Tat
transactivating regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 span the Tat activation
domain, and motif 3 the adjacent (less well-conserved) basic domain. Three
iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 106 sequences was identified. Nine partial matches
were also found: all fail to make a significant match with motif 3. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 168 sequences, and 18
partial matches.
