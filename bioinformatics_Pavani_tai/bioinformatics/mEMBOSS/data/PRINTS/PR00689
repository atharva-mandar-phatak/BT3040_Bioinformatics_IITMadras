ACOABINDINGP
Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) is a small (10 Kd) protein that binds medium-
and long-chain acyl-CoA esters with high affinity, and may act as an intra-
cellular carrier of acyl-CoA esters. ACBP has a number of important
physiological and biochemical functions: it is known as a diazepam binding
inhibitor, as a putative neurotransmitter, as a regulator of insulin
release from pancreatic cells, and as a mediator in corticotropin-dependent
adrenal steroidogenesis [1,2]. It is possible that the protein acts as a
neuropeptide that takes part in the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric
acid-ergic transmission [1].

The structure of ACBP has been deduced by NMR spectroscopy and has been
shown to be a mainly-alpha protein, consisting of 5 short alpha-helices
and 3 connecting beta-strands [2].

ACOABINDINGP is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
acyl-CoA-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 15 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif spans helix 1 and most of the
first loop; motif 2 encodes helix 2 and corresponds to the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern ACBP (PS00880); motif 3 spans part of the 
second loop, helix 3 and the N-terminal portion of helix 4; and motif 4
spans helix 5. Two iterations on OWL29.2 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 22 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
