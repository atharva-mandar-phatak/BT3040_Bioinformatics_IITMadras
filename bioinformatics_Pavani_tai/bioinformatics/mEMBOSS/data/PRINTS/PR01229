GFLUORESCENT
Green-fluorescent proteins (GFP) are involved in bioluminescence of many
jelly fish (cnidaria) [1]. GFPs serve as energy-transfer acceptors, receiving
energy from either a luciferase-oxyluciferin complex or a Ca(2+)-activated
photoprotein depending on the organism [1]. Following mechanical stimulation
of the organism, GFP emits green light spectrally identical to its 
fluorescence emission. The unique properties of these highly fluorescent
proteins arise from the chemical nature of the covalently attached 
chromophore, which contains modified amino acid residues within the 
polypeptide [1]. 

The crystal structure of recombinant wild-type GFP has been solved to 1.9A
resolution [2]. The protein fold forms a cylinder, comprising an 11-stranded
beta-barrel, with a co-axial helix within the cylinder and short helical
segments at the cylinder ends [2] - this represents a new protein fold, 
which has been termed the 'beta-can' [2]. In the crystal, two protomers
pack together to form a dimer. The fluorophores, resulting from spontaneous
cyclisation and oxidation of the sequence -Ser65/Thr65-Tyr66-Gly67-, require
the native protein fold for both formation and fluorescence emission [3].

GFLUORESCENT is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
green fluorescent proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 spans alpha-helix 1 and beta-
strand 1; motif 2 spans strands 2 and 3; motif 3 includes helices 2 and 3; 
motif 4 encompasses helices 4-6; motif 5 includes strand 4; motif 6 spans
the C-terminal portion of strand 5 and strand 6; motif 8 spans strands 7 and
8 and helix 7 between them; and motifs 9-11 encode strands 9-11 respectively.
A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
