MAN6PISMRASE
Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyses the interconversion of mannose-6-
phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate [1,2]: 
		D-mannose 6-phosphate = D-fructose 6-phosphate
The enzyme is involved, in eukaryotes, in synthesis of GDP-mannose, a
constituent of N- and O-linked glycans and GPI anchors. In prokaryotes, it
participates in a variety of pathways, including capsular polysaccharide
biosynthesis and D-mannose metabolism. 

On the basis of sequence similarity, three classes of PMI have been defined
[1]: type I includes eukaryotic PMI and the enzyme encoded by the manA gene
in enterobacteria such as E.coli. The proteins bind a zinc ion, which is
essential for their activity.
  
MAN6PISMRASE is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
type I phosphomannose isomerases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 4 includes
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern PMI_I_1 (PS00965), which contains
a Glu residue that provides one of the zinc ligands; and motifs 7 and 8
span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern PMI_I_2 (PS00966), the
conserved His of which provides another zinc ligand. A single iteration
on OWL29.3 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences, and 1
partial match.
