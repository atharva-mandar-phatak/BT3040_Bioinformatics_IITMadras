SSPAKPROTEIN
The Salmonella typhimurium surface presentation of antigens K/invasion 
protein B gene (SpaK/InvB) is one of 12 that form a cluster responsible for 
invasion properties [1]. The gene product is required for entry by the 
bacterium into epithelial cells, and is thus considered to be a virulence 
factor [1]. Other Spa genes in the cluster are related to invasion (Inv) 
genes in similar Salmonella and Shigella species [2], and to flagella 
biosynthesis genes in Helicobacter pylori [3]. A further analogous gene in   
Yersinia (Spa15 homologue) has also been found [5].
    
The SpaK/InvB protein has a molecular mass of 15kDa [5], and is believed     
to play a part in the sec-independent type III protein secretion system of 
Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri [4]. In the organisation of the 
Spa/Inv locus, the SpaK/InvB gene is found adjacent to SpaL/InvC [5], and 
may play a part in the ATPase activity possessed by the latter.

SSPAKPROTEIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
SpaK/InvB protein family of Salmonella and Shigella species. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~137 amino acids).
Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which 
point a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified.
