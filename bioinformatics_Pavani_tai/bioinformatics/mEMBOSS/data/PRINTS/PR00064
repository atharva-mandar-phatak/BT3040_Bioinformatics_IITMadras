RIBOSOMALL35
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2].

L35 is a basic protein from the large (50S) subunit [3]. Like many
basic polypeptides, L35 completely inhibits ornithine decarboxylase when
present unbound in the cell, but the inhibitory function is abolished upon 
its incorporation into ribosomes [3]. It belongs to a family of ribosomal
proteins, including L35 from eubacteria, plants and cyanelles - in lower
plants it is found in the chloroplast, but is located in the nucleus in
higher plants, suggesting chloroplast-to-nucleus relocation during the
evolution of higher plants [4].

RIBOSOMALL35 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for L35
ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length, motif 1 including the N-terminal region encoded by
PROSITE pattern RIBOSOMAL_l35 (PS00936). Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
