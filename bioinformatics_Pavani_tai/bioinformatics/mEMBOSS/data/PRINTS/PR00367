ETHRSPELEMNT
Ethylene, chemically the simplest plant hormone, participates in a 
number of stress responses and developmental processes: e.g., fruit
ripening, inhibition of stem and root elongation, promotion of seed
germination and flowering, senescence of leaves and flowers, and sex
determination [1]. DNA sequence elements that confer ethylene 
responsiveness have been shown to contain two 11bp GCC boxes, which
are necessary and sufficient for transcriptional control by ethylene.
Ethylene responsive element binding proteins (EREBPs) have now been
identified in a variety of plants. The proteins share a similar domain
of around 59 amino acids, which interacts directly with the GCC box in
the ERE. 

ETHRSPELEMNT is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
EREBPs. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions in the
DNA-binding domain. Two iterations on OWL26_0 were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, an Arabidopsis EST that 
lacks the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 55 sequences, and 1
partial match.
