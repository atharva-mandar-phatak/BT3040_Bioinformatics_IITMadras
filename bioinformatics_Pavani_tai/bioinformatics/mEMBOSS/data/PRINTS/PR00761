BINDIN
Bindin, the major protein component of the acrosome granule of sea urchin 
sperm, mediates species-specific adhesion of sperm to the egg surface 
during fertilisation [1,2]. The protein coats the acrosomal process after 
externalisation by the acrosome reaction; it binds to sulphated, fucose-
containing polysaccharides on the vitelline-layer receptor proteoglycans 
that cover the egg plasma membrane.

Bindins from different genera show high levels of sequence similarity in 
both the mature bindin domain and in the probindin precursor region. The 
most highly conserved region is a 42-residue segment in the central portion
of the mature bindin protein. This domain may be responsible for conserved 
functions of bindin, while the more highly divergent flanking regions may
be responsible for its species-specific properties [2]. 

BINDIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for bindins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the C-terminal half of
the alignment - motif 3 and 4 span a potential fucose-binding domain, and
motif 5 includes a Glu-rich region. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 17 sequences
was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
