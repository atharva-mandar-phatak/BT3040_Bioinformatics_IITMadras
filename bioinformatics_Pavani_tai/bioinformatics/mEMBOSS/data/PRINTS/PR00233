ICOSAHEDRAL
The capsid proteins of plant icosahedral positive strand RNA viruses
form 4 different domains: a positively charged, N-terminal 'R' domain,
which interacts with RNA (66 residues); a connecting arm, 'a' (35
residues); a central, surface 'S' domain, which forms the virion shell
(170 residues); and a projecting, C-terminal 'P' domain [1].

The S domain comprises 8 anti-parallel beta-strands, which form a 
twisted sheet or jelly-roll fold. This structure is shared by a number
of plant viral capsid proteins, including carmoviruses, dianthoviruses,
sobemoviruses, tombusviruses and tobacco necrosis virus [2].

ICOSAHEDRAL is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
icosahedral virus capsid proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions within the S domain, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern ICOSAH_VIR_COAT_S (PS000555), which encompasses the
third and fourth beta strands of the jelly-roll. Two iterations on OWL25.2
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
24 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also found, all
family members lacking significant matches with wither motif 1 or 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 36 sequences.
