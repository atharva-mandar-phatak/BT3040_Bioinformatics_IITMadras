KINESINLIGHT
Kinesins are found in organisms from all the major eukaryotic kingdoms:
protists, fungi, plants and animals [1]. They are believed to function
as motors for microtubule-dependent motile phenomena, such as membrane
transport, and chromosome movement during mitosis and meiosis. The
common feature of kinesins is a highly-conserved 'motor domain' that
contains binding sites for ATP and microtubules. Linked to the motor
domains are 'tail domains' that vary somewhat in amino acid sequence.
It is believed that tail domains may specify the type of cargo that
particular kinesins are able to transport along microtubules.

Kinesins contain 2 heavy and 2 light chains. Maintenance of their
quaternary structure does not require interchain disulphide bonds.
Details of the structure have been revealed by high-resolution electron
microscopy [2], showing kinesin to be an asymmetric rod-like molecule
(~80nm long), with a pair of globular heads located at one end and a
fan-shaped tail at the other. The light chains and C-termini of the heavy
chains form the tail domains, which associate with membrane-bound
organelles. Most kinesin light chains range in predicted size from 58 to
65kDa and are mildly acidic. The sequences share from 60-90% identity,
most of the diversity residing in the C-termini. This suggests that these
regions, at least in part, are responsible for their transport specificity. 

KINESINLIGHT is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
kinesin light chains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the central portion of the alignment. Two iterations on OWL25.2
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
11 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences, and 1
partial match.
