LMBPPROTEIN
The lincomycin (LM)-production gene cluster of the over-producing strain
Streptomyces lincolnensis 78-11 has been analysed [1]. The lmb/lmr gene 
cluster contains 27 open reading frames with putative biosynthetic or
regulatory functions (lmb genes) and three resistance (lmr) genes [1]. 

Only a minority of the putative Lmb proteins belong to known protein
families: these include members of the gamma-glutamyl transferases (LmbA);
amino acid acylases (LmbC); aromatic amino acid aminotransferases (LmbF);
imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratases (LmbK); dTDP-glucose synthases
(LmbO); dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratases (LmbM); and (NDP-) ketohexose (or 
ketocyclitol) aminotransferases (LmbS) [1]. 

LmbP seems to show some similarity to a family of enzymes that share an
N-terminal Gly/Ser-rich putative ATP-binding region: these include galacto-
kinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase
[2]. Sequence v031 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3] is also a homologue.

LMBPPROTEIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
LmbP proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. A single partial match was found, KIME_METTH,
a related mevalonate kinase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 
that matches motifs 1 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
