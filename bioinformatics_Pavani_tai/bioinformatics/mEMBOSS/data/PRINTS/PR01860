ADAMTS5
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix plays a critical role in
establishing tissue architecture during development, and in tissue 
degradation in diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease
and a variety of inflammatory conditions [1]. The proteolytic enzymes 
responsible for this process are members of diverse protease families, 
including the secreted zinc metalloproteases (MPs) [1]. Recently, a new
MP family, ADAM-TS (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with 
thrombospondin type I modules) has been identified. The family consists
of at least 20 members that share a high degree of sequence similarity
and conserved domain organisation [2,3].

The defining domains of the ADAM-TS family are (from N- to C-termini) a
pre-pro metalloprotease domain of the reprolysin type, a snake venom
disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type-I (TS) module, a cysteine-
rich region, and a cysteine-free (spacer) domain [3]. Domain organisation
following the spacer domain C-terminus shows some variability in certain
ADAM-TS members, principally in the number of additional TS domains.

Members of the ADAM-TS family have been implicated in a range of diseases. 
ADAM-TS1, for example, is reported to be involved in inflammation and cancer
cachexia [2], whilst recessively inherited ADAM-TS2 mutations cause
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a disorder characterised clinically by 
severe skin fragility [4]. ADAM-TS4 is an aggrecanase involved in arthritic
destruction of cartilage [5].

ADAM-TS5, also termed aggrecanase 2, was identified through expressed 
sequence tag database searching, pursuing sequences similar to 
ADAM-TS1-4 [4]. In vitro studies have shown that ADAM-TS5, like ADAM-TS4,
is an aggrecanase, able to cleave cartilage aggrecan [6].

ADAMTS5 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
ADAM-TS5 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in the 
N-terminal quarter of the alignment, focusing on those sections that 
characterise ADAM-TS5 proteins and distinguish them from other family
members - all motifs lie in the N-terminal region preceding the metallo-
protease domain. A single iteration on SPTR40_22f was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
