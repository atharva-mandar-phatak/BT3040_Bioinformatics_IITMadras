Na+/Ca2+ exchange proteins are involved in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in
a wide variety of cell types. They are found in both the plasma membrane
and intracellular organellar membranes, where they exchange Na+ for Ca2+ in
an electrogenic manner. When located in the plasma membrane, they generally
utilise the transmembrane (TM) Na+ concentration gradient in order to
extrude Ca2+ from cells. Three mammalian isoforms have been cloned to date
(NCX1-3), which consist of 920-970 amino acid residues that are predicted
to possess 11 or 12 TM domains. Interestingly, they possess a short motif 
(~30 residues) that is similar to the Na+/K+-ATPase, although its function
is unknown [1-3].

NCX1 is the principal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger of cardiac myocytes, where it is
thought to play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. It is
also found in a variety of other tissues, suggesting it serves as a house-
keeping protein, maintaining low cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Alternatively
spliced variants of NCX1 have been identified, expression of which is cell 
type-specific. Sequence analysis reveals two sets of tandem repeats are 
found within the NCX1 protein sequence, which are usually referred to as
alpha and beta. The alpha repeats are thought to be involved in the ion
binding and translocation reactions of the exchanger, and the first beta 
repeat may be part of a regulatory site that responds to Ca2+ concentration.

NACAEXCHNGR1 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform 1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
from the N-terminal half of the alignment length, focusing on those sections
that characterise isoform 1 but distinguish it from other Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
isoforms - motifs 1-2 lie on the N-terminal signal sequence that is presumed
to be cleaved in order to generate the mature protein; motif 3 encodes part 
of the first putative extracellular domain; and motif 4 is located on the
long cytoplasmic loop that connects the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic 
regions, which contain the putative TM domains. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10
sequences was identified.
