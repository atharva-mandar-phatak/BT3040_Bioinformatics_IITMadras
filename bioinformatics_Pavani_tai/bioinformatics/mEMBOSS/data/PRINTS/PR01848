U2AUXFACTOR
The U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor (U2AF) is a
heterodimeric splicing factor composed of a large and a small subunit. The
large U2AF subunit recognises the intronic polypyrimidine tract, a
sequence located adjacent to the 3' splice site that serves as an important
signal for both constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing. The small
subunit interacts with the 3' splice site dinucleotide AG and is essential
for regulated splicing. The subunits shuttle continuously between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm via a mechanism that involves carrier receptors 
and is independent of binding to mRNA. Both subunits contain an arginine/
serine-rich (RS) domain, which acts as a nuclear localisation signal.
Furthermore, the presence of an RS domain on either subunit is sufficient 
to trigger the nucleocytoplasmic import of the heterodimeric complex [1].

The human form of the U2 auxilliary factor small subunit, hU2AF35, contains
a degenerate RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal RS domain. The
murine form has been shown to be genomically imprinted with monoallelic
expression from the paternal allele [2]. However, this is not the case in
humans [3].

U2AUXFACTOR is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the U2
auxiliary factor small subunit proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 17 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the C-terminal
portion of the alignment, motifs 2-5 spanning the RNA-binding domain. Two
iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 22 sequences was identified. A single partial match 
was also found, a human hypothetical 22.0kDa protein that matches motifs
1 and 4.
