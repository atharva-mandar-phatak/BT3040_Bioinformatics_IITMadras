INTRLEUKIN19
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-19 (IL-19) belongs to the family of Il-10-related cytokines, 
which includes IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [1]. IL-19 shares a 
receptor complex with IL-20, indicating that their biological activities 
may overlap [2]. Both cytokines may play an important role in regulating 
the development and proper functioning of skin [2]. 

INTRLEUKIN19 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-19. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, each encompassing a short region of beta strand.
Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 3 sequences was identified.
