EP450ICYP2D
P450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins [1], widely
distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. The enzymes are involved
in metabolism of a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous compounds [2].
Usually, they act as terminal oxidases in multi-component electron transfer
chains, called P450-containing monooxygenase systems.

Current P450 nomenclature, based on divergent evolution of the P450
superfamily, was proposed and developed by Nebert et al. [3]. On the basis
of sequence similarity, all P450s can be categorised into 2 main classes,
the so-called B- and E-classes: P450 proteins of prokaryotic 3-component
systems and fungal P450nor (CYP55) belong to the B-class; all other known
P450s from distinct systems are of the E-class [4]. E-class P450s may be
further divided into 5 subclasses (groups) according to protein sequence
similarities. The data suggest that divergence of the P450 superfamily 
into B- and E-classes, and further divergence into stable P450 groups 
within the E-class, must be very ancient and had occured before the 
appearance of eukaryotes. 

Due to the rapid increase in numbers of P450s, Nelson introduced the concept
of a higher order classification of P450 families into clans [3] based on
sequence similarity. This is similar to the previous grouping into B- and
E-classes; both classifications are still used. According to Nelson's
system, clan 2 contains the CYP2 plus CYP1, 17, 18, 21 and 71 families, and
corresponds to the E-class group I proteins [5,6]. Members of the first 4
families are of vertebrate origin, while those from CYP71 derive from plants.
CYP1 and CYP2 enzymes mainly metabolise exogenous substrates, whereas CYP17
and CYP21 are involved in metabolism of endogenous physiologically-active
compounds. 

The CYP2 family, comprising 15 subfamilies (A-H, J-N, P and Q), is the most
dominant in clan 2. Six of these subfamilies are non-mammalian: 2H derives
from chicken; 2K, 2M, 2N and 2P are from fish; 2L is from lobster; and 2Q
from Xenopus [5]. The first five (A-E) are present in mammalian liver, but
in differing amounts and with different inducibilities [7]. These five 
subfamilies show varied substrate specificities, with some degree of 
overlap. The 2D subfamily is generally regarded as being involved in 
detoxifying pathways of metabolism. There is considerable interest in the
2D subfamilies, due to the fact that about 30% of all currently-used
drugs are metabolised in man by the 2D6 orthologue. As the constitutive
levels of 2D6 are low (1-2% of human hepatic P450 complement) and the enzyme
is non-inducible, any defect in 2D6-dependent metabolism may have serious
consequences with respect to an undesirable accumulation of pharmaceutical
agents, leading to potential toxicity and possible adverse drug reactions
[7]. The CYP2D gene is located on chromosome 22 in mouse and man [3].

EP450ICYP2D is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
CYP2D P450 family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 
18 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
N-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those sections that
characterise the CYP2D proteins but distinguish them from the rest of the
CYP2 family - using the model of de Groot et al. [8], motif 1 lies in the
N-terminal membrane anchor domain; motif 2 encodes the E helix; motif 3 
spans part of the N-terminus of the G helix, and lies between substrate
recognition site (SRS) 2 and SRS 3; motif 4 spans the I helix and
part of SRS 4; and motif 5 encodes the haem-binding domain, including the
"aromatic region" typical of E-class P450s [4]. Two iterations on SPTR40_18f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 26
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, Q9DBF6,
a murine P450 that matches motifs 1, 3 and 4.
