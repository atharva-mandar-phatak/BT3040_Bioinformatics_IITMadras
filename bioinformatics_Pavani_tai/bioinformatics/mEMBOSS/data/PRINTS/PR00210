GLUTENIN
Gluten is the protein component of wheat flour. It consists of numerous
proteins, which are of 2 different types responsible for different physical
properties of dough [1]: the glutenins, which are primarily responsible for
the elasticity, and the gliadins, which contribute to the extensibility.
The glutenins themselves are of 2 different types, termed low and high [2] 
molecular weight subunits. The latter have unusual structures: a central 
region contains multiple tandem repeats of blocks of amino acids, forming a
loose helix based on beta reverse turns, and is flanked by globular 
regions, which can be cross-linked by disulphide bonds. The result is an 
elastic network in which the elasticity may derive from the cross-linking, 
the helical structure, or a combination of these [3].

GLUTENIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the high 
molecular weight glutenins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved N- and
C-terminal hydrophobic regions. Four iterations on SPTR57_40f were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 166 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are family
members that fail to make a significant match with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR57.15_40.15f identified a true set of 191 sequences and 9
partial matches.
