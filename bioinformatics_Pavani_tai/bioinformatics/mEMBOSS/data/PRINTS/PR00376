IL1BCENZYME
Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1B
precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine, which plays a central role in
acute and chronic inflammation, bone resorption, myelogenous leukemia, and
other pathological processes [1]. ICE is a cysteine protease with substrate
cleavage specificity for Asp-X [2]. It is synthesised largely in monocytes
as an inactive proenzyme that autoprocesses to an active tetramer of 2
10kDa and 2 20KDa subunits. The physiological functions of the mammalian
ICE homologues are unknown, but overexpression of ICE and its homologues in
transfected cell lines induces apoptosis [3,4]

IL1BCENZYME is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
interleukin-1B converting enzymes. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment. Two
iterations on OWL25.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. Two partial matches
were also found: HSU13022 is a fragment lacking the final 2 motifs,
and NED2_MOUSE is a murine NEDD-2 sequence that lacks the first 5 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 33 sequences, and 12
partial matches.
