COAGULIN
Coagulogen is a gel-forming protein of hemolymph that hinders the spread of
invaders by immobilising them [1,2]. The protein contains a single 175-
residue polypeptide chain; this is cleaved after Arg-18 and Arg-46 by a
clotting enzyme contained in the hemocyte and activated by a bacterial
endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). Cleavage releases two chains of coagulin,
A and B, linked by two disulphide bonds, together with the peptide C [1,2].
Gel formation results from interlinking of coagulin molecules.

Secondary structure prediction suggests the C peptide forms an alpha-
helix, which is released during the proteolytic conversion of coagulogen to
coagulin gel [1]. The beta-sheet structure and 16 half-cystines found in the
molecule appear to yield a compact protein stable to acid and heat.

COAGULIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
coagulins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length - motif 1 includes the A chain; motif 2 lies in the C
peptide; and motifs 3-8 reside in the B chain. A single iteration on
OWL29.4 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
