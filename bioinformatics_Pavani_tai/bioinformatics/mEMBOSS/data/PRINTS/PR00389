PHPHLIPASEA2
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a small lipolytic enzyme involved in a number
of physiologically important cellular processes, such as the liberation
of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids [1]. It plays a pivotal
role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin and other mediators of
inflammation. PLA2 sequences contain around 120 amino acid residues: they
have 4-7 disulphide bonds and bind a calcium ion, which is essential for
activity. Within the active enzyme, the alpha amino group is involved in
a conserved hydrogen-bonding network linking the N-terminal region to
the active site. The side chains of 2 conserved residues, His and Asp,
participate in the catalytic network.

PHPHLIPASEA2 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
phospholipase A2 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 3 and 5 include the regions
encoded by PROSITE patterns PA2_HIS (PS00118) and PA2_ASP (PS00119), which
contain the active site His and Asp residues respectively. Three iterations
on OWL26.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 144 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, many of which are N-terminal fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 139 sequences, and 19
partial matches.
