LDLRECEPTOR
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein
of plasma. The receptor protein binds LDL and transports it into cells by
endocytosis. In order to be internalised, the receptor-ligand complex must
first cluster into clathrin-coated pits. The N-terminal region of the
extracellular domain contains 7 or 8 40-residue repeats, each of which
contains 6 cysteine residues, which are involved in disulphide bond 
formation. Following these repeats is a 350 residue domain that resembles
part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor [1,2].

LDLRECEPTOR is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Cys-
rich LDL repeats. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
2 sequences: each of the motifs encodes 3 well-conserved Cys residues in a
22 residue motif (i.e., corresponds to about half of the 6-Cys repeat). Two
iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 14 sequences was identified. Four partial matches were
also found: all are LDL-receptors, neural cell adhesion molecules, and
basement membrane heparan sulphate proteoglycans (perlecans), which are
known to show a high degree of similarity to LDL-receptors.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 41 sequences, and 34
partial matches.
