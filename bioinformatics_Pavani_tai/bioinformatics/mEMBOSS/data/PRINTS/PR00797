STREPTOPAIN
Cysteine protease activity is dependent on an active dyad of cysteine and
histidine, the order and spacing of these residues varying in the 20 or so
known families. Families C1, C2 and C10 are loosely termed papain-like.  
Nearly half of all cysteine proteases are found exclusively in viruses [1].

Streptopain is a cysteine protease found in Streptococcus pyogenes that
shows some structural and functional similarity to papain (family C1) [1,2].
The order of the catalytic cysteine/histidine dyad is the same and the
surrounding sequences are similar. The two proteins also show similar
specificities, both preferring a hydrophobic residue at the P2 site [1,3].
Streptopain shows a high degree of sequence similarity to the Streptomyces
pyogenes exotoxin B, and strong similarity to the prtT gene product of
Porphyromonas gingivalis, both of which have been included in the family [1].

STREPTOPAIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
streptopain (C10) family of cysteine proteases. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1
contains the active cysteine, and motif 4 the active histidine. Two
iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences.
