HIRUDIN
Hirudin is a potent thrombin inhibitor secreted by the salivary glands of
the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis [1]. It forms a stable non-covalent
complex with alpha-thrombin, thereby abolishing its ability to cleave
fibrinogen. The protein belongs to the hirudin family.

The structure of hirudin has been solved by NMR [2], and the structure 
of a recombinant hirudin-thrombin complex has been determined by X-ray
crystallography to 2.3A [3]. Hirudin consists of an N-terminal globular
domain and an extended C-terminal domain. Residues 1-3 form a parallel beta-
strand with residues 214-217 of thrombin, the nitrogen atom of residue 1
making a hydrogen bond with the Ser195 O gamma atom of the catalytic site.
The C-terminal domain makes numerous electrostatic interactions with an
anion-binding exosite of thrombin, while the last five residues are in
a helical loop that forms many hydrophobic contacts [3].

HIRUDIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for hirudins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 16 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length - motif 1 encodes 2 beta-turns; motif 2 spans 4 turns and the
first short beta-strand; and motif 3 spans the second strand and a gamma-
turn. Two iterations on OWL29.4 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 19 sequences was identified. Two
partial matches were found, both of which are family members that fail
to make significant matches with one or more motifs. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 1
partial match.
