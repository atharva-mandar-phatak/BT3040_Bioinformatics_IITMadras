LIGHTHARVSTA
The antenna complexes of photosynthetic bacteria function as light-
harvesting systems that absorb light and transfer the excitation energy
to the reaction centers. The antenna complexes usually comprise 2
polypeptides (alpha- and beta-chains), 2-3 bacteriochlorophyll molecules
and some carotenoids [1,2].

The alpha- and beta-chains are small proteins of 40-70 residues. Each has 
an N-terminal hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane (TM)
region, and a small C-terminal hydrophilic periplasmic domain. In both
chains, the TM domain houses a conserved His residue, presumed to be
involved in binding the magnesium atom of a bacteriochlorophyll group.
The beta-chains are characterised by a further histidine at the C-terminal
extremity of the cytoplasmic domain, which is also thought to be involved
in bacteriochlorophyll binding.

LIGHTHARVSTA is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
light harvesting protein A chains. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 26 sequences: the motifs span the full alignment
length - motif 1 was drawn from the cytoplasmic domain; motif 2 spans
the TM domain and includes the conserved His (cf. PROSITE pattern 
ANTENNA_COMP_ALPHA (PS00968)); and motif 3 lies in the C-terminal
periplasmic domain. Two iterations on OWL29.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 34 sequences was
identified. Three partial matches were also found, all of which are family
members that fail to make significant matches with either motif 1 or 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 31 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
