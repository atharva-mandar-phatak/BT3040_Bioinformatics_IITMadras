FORMIN
Vertebrate limb formation is an evolutionarily conserved process programmed
by an array of morphogenetic genes [1]. The formins are a set of protein
isoforms encoded by the alternatively spliced transcripts arising from the
murine limb deformity (ld) locus [2]. Mutations in this locus disrupt
formation of the anteroposterior axis of the embryonic limb.

Formins are found in the adult kidney, testis, limb, ovary, brain, small
intestine, salivary and harderian glands, and throughout the embryo. In the 
developing limb bud, the protein is expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge
and mesenchymal compartment, predominantly in the posterior region [3].
During kidney morphogenesis, early expression is restricted to the
epithelial compartment of the pronephros and mesonephros [3].

FORMIN is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for formin
limb deformity proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motifs 1-3 precede a central
pro-rich region, and motifs 4-10 lie C-terminal to it. A single iteration
on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match was found, 
DMU34258, a sequence from a Drosophila maternal effect gene (cappuccino)
that is related to the vertebrate limb deformity locus.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences, and 1
partial match.
