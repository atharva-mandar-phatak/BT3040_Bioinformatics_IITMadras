GLHYDRLASE1
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt).

Family 1 includes beta-glucosidases, beta-galactosidases, plant myrosinases,
mammalian lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, and so on.  Alignments of such
sequences reveal a number of short conserved regions, one of which contains
a glutamic acid residue, which has been shown to be involved in glycosidic 
bond cleavage in beta-glucosidase from Agrobacterium [5].

GLHYDRLASE1 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 1 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in
the second half of the alignment up to the C-terminus, motif 2 including 
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROLASE_F1_1 (PS00572),
which contains the catalytically active Glu. Three iterations on OWL24.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
38 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found:
BGLS_TRIRP fails to make a significant match with motif 2 and is truncated
at motif 5; and BGLT_TRIRP is a fragment that matches only motifs 1 and 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 75 sequences, and 11
partial matches.
