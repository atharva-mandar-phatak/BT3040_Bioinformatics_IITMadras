GLHYDRLASE20
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 20 encompasses beta-hexosaminidases and chitobiases.  

In the brain and other tissues, beta-hexosaminidase A degrades GM2
gangliosides; specifically, the enzyme hydrolyses terminal non-reducing
N-acetyl-D-hexosamine residues in N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminides. There are
3 forms of beta-hexosaminidase: hexosaminidase A is a trimer, with one
alpha, one beta-A and one beta-B chain; hexosaminidase B is a tetramer of
two beta-A and two beta-B chains; and hexosaminidase S is a homodimer of
alpha chains. The two beta chains are derived from the cleavage of a
precursor. Mutations in the beta-chain lead to Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal
storage disorder characterised by accumulation of GM2 ganglioside [5].

GLHYDRLASE20 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment - motifs 1-4 lie in the
beta-B chain, and motifs 5-8 in the beta-A chain. Two iterations on OWL29.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
19 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are related sequences that fail to make significant matches with
one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
