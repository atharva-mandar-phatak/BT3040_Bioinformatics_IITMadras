FMRFAMIDEPEP
Neuropeptide FF (together with neuropeptides AF and SF, which are derived
from the same precursor) belongs to a family of neuropeptides containing an 
RF-amide motif at their C-termini [1]. Neuropeptide FF is found at high
concentrations in the posterior pituitary, spinal cord, hypothalamus and 
medulla, and is believed to be involved in pain modulation, opioid tolerance,
cardiovascular regulation, memory and neuroendocrine regulation [1,2].

FMRFAMIDEPEP is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
FMRFamide-related peptide precursor. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
sections spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 encodes the putative
signal peptide; motif 4 spans the region of the precursor that encodes
neuropeptides SF and FF; and motif 6 encodes neuropeptide AF. A single
iteration on SPTR40_18f was required to reach convergence, no further 
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
