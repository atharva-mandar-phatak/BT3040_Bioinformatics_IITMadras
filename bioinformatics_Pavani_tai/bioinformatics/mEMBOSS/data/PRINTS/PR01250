RIBOSOMALL34
Protein synthesis is co-ordinated in all cells by ribosomes, ribonucleo-
protein particles containing more than 50 different proteins and several
large RNAs [1]. Low resolution models show the protein arrangement in both
the large and small ribosomal subunits, but higher resolution structures are
required to reveal the detailed mechanistic functioning of the complex [2].

Ribosomal protein L34 contains 89-129 amino acid residues. On the basis of
sequence similarity, the ribosomal L34 family can be shown to include:
mammalian L34; mosquito L31 [1]; plant L34 [2]; yeast putative ribosomal
protein YIL052c; and Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0655.

RIBOSOMALL34 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
ribosomal L34 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern RIBOSOMAL_L34E (PS01145). Two iterations on 
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 14 sequences was identified.
