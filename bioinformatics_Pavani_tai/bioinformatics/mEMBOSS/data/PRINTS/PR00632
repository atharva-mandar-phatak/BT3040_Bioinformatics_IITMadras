SONICHHOG
The hedgehog protein precursor, HH, is involved in segment polarity and
cell to cell communication, and plays important roles in both early
embryogenesis and metamorphosis [1-4]. The protein is expressed in embryo 
stripes [1], and in several groups of cells belonging to the foregut,
hindgut and various other unidentified tissues. Maximum expression is seen
in embryos 6-12 hours after fertilisation, and in pupae 1-24 hours after
puparium formation. 

SONICHHOG is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
hedgehog protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 16 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL28.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
21 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found: 
CEU61236, a C.elegans M75 protein that matches motifs 6 and 7.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
