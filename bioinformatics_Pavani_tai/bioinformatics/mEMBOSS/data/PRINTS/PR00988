URIDINKINASE
Uridine kinase (pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase) is the rate-limiting 
enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway [1]. It catalyses the reaction:

		   ATP + Uridine = ADP + UMP

A cDNA for uridine kinase from mouse brain has been characterised [1]. The
translated sequence encodes a protein of 277 amino acids. A truncated form 
of the cDNA has been expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to display
uridine kinase activity and to readily form a tetramer, the most active
form of the wild-type enzyme [1]. Sequence analysis has identified three 
ATP-binding site consensus motifs. The predicted secondary structure, and 
sequence comparison with kinases of known structure, is consistent with
uridine kinase having the alpha/beta core nucleotide-binding fold common 
to many kinases [1].

A previously undescribed pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase that preferentially 
phosphorylates cytidine to yield its 5'-monophosphate form has been isolated
from Escherichia coli [2].

URIDINKINASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
uridine kinase family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning 
virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 9 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found: D78335 is a human gene 
product that matches motifs 4-6; CEB00012 is a Caenorhabditis elegans
cosmid sequence that matches motifs 1, 3 and 6; and KPPR_MESCR and OSPRK
are closely related phosphoribulokinases that match motifs 3 and 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
