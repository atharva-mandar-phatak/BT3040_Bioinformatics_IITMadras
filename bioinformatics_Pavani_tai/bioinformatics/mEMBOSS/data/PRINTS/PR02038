AURORABORA
Aurora-A, a protein kinase required for centrosome maturation, spindle
assembly and asymmetric protein localisation during mitosis, is activated
by Aurora borealis protein, Bora, at the onset of the mitotic cycle [1].
Bora is a nuclear protein in interphase cells, but is excluded from the 
nucleus and translocates to the cytoplasm in a Cdc2-dependent manner when
the cell enters mitosis [1]. It has been suggested that activation of Cdc2
initiates the release of Bora into the cytoplasm, where it binds and
activates Aurora-A [1].

AURORABORA is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Aurora
borealis proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
N-terminal half of the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR57.15_40.15f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 22 
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of
which are uncharacterised proteins that make significant matches with 2 or
more motifs.
