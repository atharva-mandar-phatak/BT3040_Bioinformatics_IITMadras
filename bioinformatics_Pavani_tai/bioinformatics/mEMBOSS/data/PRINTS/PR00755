AFLATOXINBRP
Aflatoxins belong to a family of decaketides that are produced as secondary
metabolites by Aspergillus flavus and A.parasiticus [1]. The aflatoxin
biosynthetic pathway involves several enzymatic steps that appear to be
regulated by the afl2 gene in A.flavus and the apa2 gene in A.parasiticus
[1]. These genes are homologues and have been designated aflR [1].

AflR encodes a protein that contains a cysteine-rich motif. Several fungal
transcriptional activator proteins contain this motif, which binds DNA in
a zinc-dependent fashion. The motif forms a binuclear zinc cluster in which
six conserved cysteines bind two zinc cations [2,3].

AFLATOXINBRP is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
aflatoxin biosynthesis regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs
1 and 2 span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern ZN2_CY6_FUNGAL (PS00463),
which contains the binuclear cluster motif. A single iteration on OWL29.4
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
