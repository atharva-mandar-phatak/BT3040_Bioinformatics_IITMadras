SSBTLNINHBTR
The Streptomyces family of bacteria produce a number of protease inhibitors,
which are characterised by their strong activity towards subtilisin - they
are collectively known as Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitors (SSI) [1]. Some
SSI also inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin. Mutation of the active site
residue can influence inhibition specificity [1]. 

SSI is a homodimer, each monomer containing 2 anti-parallel beta-sheets
and 2 short alpha-helices [2]. Protease binding induces the widening of a
channel-like structure, in which hydrophobic side-chains are sandwiched
between 2 lobes [2]. Loss of the C-terminal tetrapeptide VFAF drastically
reduces the inhibitory effect of the proteins when there is less than one
molecule of inhibitor present per molecule of enzyme: this implies that 
the tetrapeptide is neccessary to maintain the correct 3D fold [3]. 

Structural similarities between the primary and secondary contact loops of
SSI, and the ovomucoid and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor family
suggest evolution of the 2 families from a common ancestor [2]. 

SSBTLNINHBTR is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitors. The fingerprint was derived from 
an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 
encompass the region encoded by PROSITE pattern SSI (PS00999), the 2 Cys
residues of which are involved in disulphide bond formation; motif 3 spans
the active site region; and motif 4 describes a beta strand. Two iterations
on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 15 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 1
partial match.
