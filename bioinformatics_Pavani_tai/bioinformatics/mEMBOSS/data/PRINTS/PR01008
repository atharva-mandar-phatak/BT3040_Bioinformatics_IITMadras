FLGLRINGFLGH
The flgH, flgI and fliF genes of Salmonella typhimurium encode the major 
proteins for the L, P and M rings of the flagellar basal body [1]. In fact,
the basal body consists of four rings (L,P,S and M) surrounding the
flagellar rod, which is believed to transmit motor rotation to the filament 
[2]. The M ring is integral to the inner membrane of the cell, and may be
connected to the rod via the S (supramembrane) ring, which lies just distal
to it. The L and P rings reside in the outer membrane and periplasmic space,
respectively.

The sequences of the FlgH, FlgI and FliF gene products have been determined
[1]. FlgH and FlgI, which are exported across the cell membrane to their 
destinations in the outer membrane and periplasmic space, have typical N-
terminal cleaved signal-peptide sequences [1]. FlgH is predicted to have
an extensive beta-sheet structure, in keeping with other outer membrane 
proteins [1]. Several aspects of the DNA sequence of these genes and their
surrounds suggest complex regulation of the flagellar gene system. 

FLGLRINGFLGH is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
flagellar L-ring proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the C-terminal two-thirds of the alignment. A single iteration
on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being 
identified beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found: 
AE0007528 is an Aquifex aeolicus sequence that matches motifs 3-5; and
E64560 is an L-ring protein from Helicobacter pylori that matches motifs
3 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
