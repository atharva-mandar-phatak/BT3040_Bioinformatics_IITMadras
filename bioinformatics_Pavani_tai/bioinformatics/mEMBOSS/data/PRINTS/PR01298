MICROCIN
The structural and functional relationships among independently cloned
segments of the plasmid ColE1 region that regulates and codes for colicin E1
(cea), immunity (imm) and the mitomycin C-induced lethality function (lys)
have been analysed [1]. A model for the structure and expression of the 
colicin E1 operon has been proposed in which the cea and lys genes are 
expressed from a single inducible promoter that is controlled by the lexA
repressor in response to the SOS system of Escherichia coli [1]. The imm 
gene lies between the cea and lys genes and is expressed by transcription
in the opposite direction from a promoter located within the lys gene [1].
This arrangement indicates that the transcriptional units for all three
genes overlap. It is proposed that the formation of anti-sense RNA may 
be an important element in the coordinate regulation of gene expression
in this system [1]. 

Hydropathy analysis of the imm gene products suggests that they have 
hydrophobic domains characteristic of membrane-associated proteins [1].
The microcin E1 immunity protein is able to protect a cell that harbours
the plasmid ColE1 encoding colicin E1 against colicin E1; it is thus
essential both for autonomous replication and colicin E1 immunity [2]. 

MICROCIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for microcins.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length
- motifs 1, 2 and 5 each span hydrophobic domains. A single iteration on
SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match was found,
O87672, an uncharacterised protein from Aeromonas hydrophila that lacks
part of the final motif.
