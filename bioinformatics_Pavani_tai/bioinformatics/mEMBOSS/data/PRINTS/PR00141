PROTEASOME
The proteasome is a novel type of intracellular complex of approximately 15
subunits with multiple proteolytic activities [1], and is variously known
as multicatalytic endopeptidase complex, multicatalytic proteinase complex,
or prosome. Homologues of these subunits are thought to be involved in 
antigen processing, although there is no direct evidence of proteasome 
involvement [2]. These homologues are located between the 2 transporter 
proteins of the major histocompatability complex I (MHCI) [3], and it is
thought that they process intracellular antigens by proteolytically 
cleaving them. The resulting peptides are then transported to the endo-
plasmic reticulum via the 2 transporters on MHC I, and are then presented 
to the cell surface where the are recognised by T-cells.

PROTEASOME is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
proteasome components. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 1 including part of the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern PROTEASOME_B (PS00854). Two iterations on
OWL19.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 12 sequences was identified. Two proteasome fragments were also
found (fragments shorter than 20 residues are not identified by the
fingerprint).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 44 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
