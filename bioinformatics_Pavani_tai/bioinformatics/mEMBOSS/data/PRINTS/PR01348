ICLNCHANNEL
The nucleotide-sensitive chloride conductance regulatory protein (ICln) is
found ubiquitously in mammalian (and other) cell types and is postulated to
play a critical role in cell volume regulation. Initial studies proposed
that ICln was itself a swelling-activated anion channel; however, further
studies demonstrated that it is localised primarily to the cell cytoplasm.
It has therefore been postulated that activation of cell volume regulation
may involve reversible translocation of ICln from the cytoplasm, and its
insertion into the plasma membrane.

It is not resolved whether the anionic channel involved in cell volume
regulation after cell-swelling comprises one or more subunits, and if it
does, whether ICln is in fact one of them [1].

ICLNCHANNEL is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
nucleotide-sensitive chloride conductance regulatory protein (ICln). The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the N-terminal half of
the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was
identified.
