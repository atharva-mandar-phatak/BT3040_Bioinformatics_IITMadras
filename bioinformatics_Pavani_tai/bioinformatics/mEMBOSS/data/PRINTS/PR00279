BACTRLTOXIN
Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins belong
to a family of related toxins [1,2] that share the ability to bind to
the major histocompatibility complex proteins of their hosts. A more
distant relative of the family is the Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock
syndrome toxin, which shares only a low level of sequence similarity
with this group. 

BACTRLTOXIN is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from the short conserved regions encoded by PROSITE
patterns STAPH_STREP_TOXIN_1 (PS00277) and STAPH_STREP_TOXIN_2 (PS00278).
Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 17 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences.
