COPRGNOXDASE
Coprogen oxidase (i.e. coproporphyrin III oxidase or coproporphyrinogenase)
catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to proto-
porhyrinogen IX in the haem and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways [1,2].
The protein is a homodimer containing 2 iron atoms per molecule of native
protein [3]. The iron atoms can be removed neither by exhaustive dialysis
nor by gel filtration, indicating that they are internally bound [3]: their
involvement in the catalytic activity cannot be demonstrated, the enzyme
only being active in the presence of molecular oxygen (acting as the
electron acceptor) [3]. Thiol-directed agents partially inhibit catalytic
activity, indicating that an SH group is required for activity [3].

COPRGNOXDASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
coprogen oxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length, motif 5 including the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern COPROGEN_OXIDASE (PS01021), a highly-conserved charged
area containing the putative catalytically-important Cys. Two iterations on
OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 1
partial match.
