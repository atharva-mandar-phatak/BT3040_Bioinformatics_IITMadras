LINKMODULE
The link module (also known as HABM (HA binding module) or PTR (proteoglycan
tandem repeat) is an approximately 100 amino acid long hyaluronic acid-
binding domain found in vertebrate proteins involved in assembling the
extracellular matrix and in cell adhesion and migration [1-3]. The structure
consists of two alpha-helices and two short anti-parallel beta-strands built 
around a hydrophobic core [2]. The module contains four conserved cysteines 
involved in two disulphide bridges, as illustrated schematically below:

                            +----------+
                            |          |
            xxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxx
                |                                      |
                +--------------------------------------+

Proteins containing link modules include the proteoglycans aggrecan, 
brevican, neurocan and versican, and the cartilage link protein, each of
which contain two modules; tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein TSG-6 
and CD44 cell surface antigen, which each contain a single module (that in 
CD44 being at the N-terminus).

LINKMODULE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
link module. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from strategically selected conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 encodes the N-terminal
helical region and first conserved cysteine residue; motif 2 spans the 
region flanking the second conserved Cys; motif 3 includes the region
preceding the third conserved Cys; and motif 4 is centred on the short
C-terminal beta-strand and fourth conserved Cys. Two iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 41 sequences was identified.
