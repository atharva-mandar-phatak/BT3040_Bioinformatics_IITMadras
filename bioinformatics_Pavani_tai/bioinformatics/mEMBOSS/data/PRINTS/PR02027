ARCARG31
Arc (Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated protein), also referred to
as arg3.1 (Activity-Regulated Gene), is a mammalian immediate-early gene
that has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory
processes [1-4]. It has been shown that Arc/Arg3.1 expression increases with
strong synaptic activation [3]. Its mRNA is transported to activated 
dendritic regions, conferring on the protein-distribution temporal 
correlation with the inducing stimulus and spatial specificity [3]. 

Via interactions with dynamin and endophilin isoforms, the Arc/Arg3.1
protein enhances receptor endocytosis [2]. Specifically, it modulates
trafficking of neuronal AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) by
accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression [2]. In particular,
Arc/Arg3.1 has been shown to reduce the number of GluR2/3 receptors, 
leading to a decrease in AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents [3]. These
observations are consistent with a role in homeostatic regulation of
synaptic strength [3]. 

ARCARG31 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated proteins. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 2 encompasses
an SH3-binding region. A single iteration on SPTR57_40f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the 
starting set.
