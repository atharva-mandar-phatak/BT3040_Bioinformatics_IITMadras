GENE66
The IR5 open reading frame (ORF) of the equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)
genome maps within the inverted repeat segments [1]. Sequence analyses of
the gene region revealed an ORF of 236 amino acids that showed a high degree
of similarity to ORF64 of varicella zoster virus and ORF3 of EHV-4, both of
which map within the inverted repeats, and to the US10 ORF of herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV-1), which maps within the unique short segment [1]. 

The IR5 ORF houses a sequence of 13 residues (CAYWCCLGHAFAC) that matches
perfectly the consensus zinc finger motif (C-X2-4-C-X2-15-C/H-X2-4-C/H) [1].
Putative cis-acting elements flanking the IR5 ORF include a TATA box, a 
CAAT box, and a polyadenylation signal. Coupled with various experimental
data, the IR5 gene of EHV-1 thus exhibits characteristics representative of
a late gene of the gamma-1 class. 

The DNA sequence covering ~70% of the short unique region (Us) and part of 
the short inverted repeat of the Marek's disease virus type 1 GA strain has
been determined [2]. Sequence analysis showed the presence of nine potential
ORFs in the Us region, four of which were found to be similar to US10 
(minor virion protein) [2].

GENE66 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for so-called
gene 66 (IR5) proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved 
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 4 includes the
first 10 residues of the putative zinc-finger motif. A single iteration on
OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being 
identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match was found, 
U639_HSVMG, a hypothetical Marek's disease herpesvirus protein that matches
motifs 3 and 4. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
