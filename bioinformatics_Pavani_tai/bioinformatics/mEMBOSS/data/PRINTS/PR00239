RHODOPSNTAIL
Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that mediate vision [1,2].
They comprise an apoprotein (opsin), covalently linked to the chromophore
cis-retinal. Vision is effected through the absorption of a photon by the
chromophore, which is isomerised to the all-trans form, promoting a
conformational change in the protein.

Opsins are integral membrane proteins that belong to a superfamily of 
G protein-coupled receptors. The activating ligands of the different super-
family members vary widely in structure and character, yet the proteins
appear faithfully to have conserved a basic structural framework, believed
to consist of 7 transmembrane (TM) helices. Although the sequences of these
proteins are very diverse, reflecting to some extent this broad range of
activating ligands, nevertheless, motifs have been identified in the TM
regions that are characteristic of virtually the entire superfamily [3,4]. 

The sequences of the molluscan rhodopsins depart from those of other
rhodopsins by virtue of bearing intra-cellular C-terminal tails, which are
characterised by a repetitive Gln/Pro-rich motif [5,6]. Although the 
precise function of the tail is unknown, it may be involved in the
immobilisation of the protein in the membrane, or may be important in
confering the high degree of order found in the microvilli of the 
receptors (which itself may play a role in the detection of plane
polarised light).

RHODOPSNTAIL is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
C-terminal Pro/Gln-rich repeats of molluscan rhodopins. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn
exclusively from the C-terminal repeat region. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6
sequences was identified.
