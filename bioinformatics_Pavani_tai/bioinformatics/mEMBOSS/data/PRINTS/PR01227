SSPAMPROTEIN
The Salmonella typhimurium surface presentation of antigens M gene (SpaM)
is one of 12 that form a cluster responsible for invasion properties [1].
The gene product is required for entry by the bacterium into epithelial
cells, and is thus considered to be a virulence factor [1]. Other Spa genes 
in the cluster are related to invasion (Inv) genes in similar Salmonella 
and Shigella species [2], and to flagella biosynthesis genes in Helicobacter
pylori [3].
    
A homologue of this protein has been found recently in Salmonella enterica
[4]. The protein, named InvI, is required by the organism to gain access to
mammalian epithelial cells, and cellular mutants (InvI-) failed to
successfully infect these cells. It has also been found that the inv-spa 
loci of this particular species encode for a type III protein secretion
system, essential in the bacterium's host cell invasion process [5].

SSPAMPROTEIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
spa-inv family of proteins in Salmonella. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length (~147 amino acid residues). Two
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set of 12 sequences was identified.
