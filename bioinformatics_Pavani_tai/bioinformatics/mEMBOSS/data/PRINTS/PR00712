BNATPEPTIDE
Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) are vertebrate hormones that play an
important role in the control of cardiovascular homeostatis, and sodium
and water balance in general [1-3]. There are different NPs that vary in
length but share a common core. All are processed from a single precursor.
A disulphide bond resident in the C-terminal section is required for full
activity of atriopeptins.

The family of NPs includes structurally-related peptides that elicit 
similar pharmacological spectra: amongst these are brain natriuretic
peptide (BNP); C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP); ventricular natriuretic
peptide (VNP) [4]; and green mamba natriuretic peptide (DNP) [5]. 

BNATPEPTIDE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for brain
natriuretic peptides. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length - motifs 4 and 5 span the C-terminal region encoded
by PROSITE pattern NATRIURETIC_PEPTIDE (PS00263), which includes the two
functionally important cysteines and two conserved glycines, which may be
important for the conformation of the peptides. Two iterations on OWL29.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
6 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are fragments and/or related natriuretic peptides.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 13
partial matches.
