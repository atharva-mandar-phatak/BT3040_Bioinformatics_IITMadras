AOTCASE
Carbamoyltransferase enzymes catalyse the association of a specific 
substrate with carbamoyl-phosphate: ornithine carbamoyltransferase 
catalyses the synthesis of citrulline from carbamoyl-phosphate and 
ornithine [1] and is involved in one of the steps of the arginine 
biosynthetic pathway; aspartate carbamoyltransferase catalyses the 
formation of carbamoyl-aspartate, the commitment step in the 
pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. 

AOTCASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
ornithine/aspartate carbamoyltransferase superfamily. The fingerprint 
was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: motif 1 encodes a
region containing 3 residues implicated in binding the phosphoryl group of
carbamyol phosphate (cf. PROSITE pattern CARBAMOYLTRANSFERASE (PS00097)).
Four iterations on OWL15.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 49 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 77 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
