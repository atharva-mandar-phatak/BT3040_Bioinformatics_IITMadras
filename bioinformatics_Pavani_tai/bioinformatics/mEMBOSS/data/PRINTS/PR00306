SERUMAMYLOID
Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are a family of vertebrate apolipoproteins
that associate with high density lipoproteins (HDL) [1]. In normal serum,
most family members are present at low concentration, but their synthesis
is rapidly increased in cases of acute inflammation, making them major
acute-phase reactants [2]. The principal physiological role of SAA is
uncertain, but continued elevation of plasma SAA levels, as in chronic
inflammation, results in amyloidosis, a pathological condition characterised
by the deposition of highly insoluble amyloid A fibrils in the liver,
kidney and spleen [2,3]. The proteins are polymorphic, the various isoforms
apparently capable of responding in different ways to different stimuli.

SERUMAMYLOID is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for serum
amyloid A proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions encompassing
virtually the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern SAA (PS00992), which describes a well-conserved
motif in the centre of the sequence. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 32
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, S20104 and
PL0166, both of which are amyloid protein fragments lacking the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 32 sequences.
