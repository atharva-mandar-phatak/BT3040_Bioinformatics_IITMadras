INTERLEUKIN7
Interleukins are soluble factors that stimulate growth-related activities
of leukocytes and other cell types [1]: they enhance cell proliferation and
differentiation, DNA synthesis, secretion of other biologically active
molecules, and responses to immune and inflammatory stimuli [1,2].

Interleukin-7 (IL7) is a hematopoietic growth factor produced by bone
marrow stromal cells [1,2]. It promotes growth of B-cell precursors, and
functions with IL2 in the activation of mature T-cells [1,2].

INTERLEUKIN7 is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
interleukin-7. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length -  motif 7 spans the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern INTERLEUKIN_7 (PS00255), a conserved heptapeptide in the C-terminal
region of the protein. A single iteration on OWL26.3 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified behyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
