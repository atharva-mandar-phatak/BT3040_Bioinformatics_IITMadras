MAPKPHPHTASE
The dual specificity phosphatases, also known as MAP Kinase Phosphatases 
(MKP), constitute a class of phosphatases that reverse the activation of MAP
(mitogen activated protein) kinases by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine 
and threonine residues [1]. This regulation is mediated via interaction of a 
Kinase Interaction Motif (KIM) with the common docking domain of the kinase 
- this motif is shared with a number of other protein families that interact 
with MAP kinases: these include kinases (MEKs), phosphatases (PTP-SL) and 
transcription factors (Elk1). MKPs also share an active site motif with the
protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Different MKPs exhibit specificity 
towards different members of the MAP kinase family [2].

The structure of the MPK catalytic domain is similar to that of the PTPs 
[3] - the fold exhibits a complex mixed alpha-/beta-architecture. The 
catalytic mechanism involves a general acid (Asp92 in 1VHR) and a catalytic 
cysteine (130 in 1VHR), which acts as a nucleophile.

MAPKPHPHTASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
MAP kinase phosphatases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 30 
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, most of
which appear to be N- or C-terminal fragments.
