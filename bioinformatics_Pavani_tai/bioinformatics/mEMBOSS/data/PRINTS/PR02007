ODORANTBPGP9
The fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, exists in either monogyne or polygyne
social forms: the former contains a single reproductive queen, the latter
multiple queens. These social behavioural differences are associated with
variation at gene Gp-9, colonies bearing only the B allelic variant being
monogyne, those bearing both B and b-like variants being polygyne [1-3].
 
Gp-9 is a pheromone-binding protein, and may act as a homodimer. Little is
known about Gp-9 at the molecular level, but it seems that differences in
worker Gp-9 genotypes between social forms may lead to differences in their
ability to recognise queens and hence regulate their numbers [4].

ODORANTBPGP9 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
pheromone-binding protein Gp-9. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 20 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 71
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found,
A9LKQ7_SOLIN, a putative odorant-binding protein from Solenopsis invicta
that fails to make a significant match with motif 1.
