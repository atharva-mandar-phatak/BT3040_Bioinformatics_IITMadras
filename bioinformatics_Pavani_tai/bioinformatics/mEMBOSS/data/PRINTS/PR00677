PHOSDUCIN
The outer and inner segments of vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells contain
phosducin, a soluble phosphoprotein that complexes with the beta/gamma-
subunits of the GTP-binding protein, transducin [1]. Light-induced changes
in cyclic nucleotide levels modulate the phosphorylation of phosducin by
protein kinase A [1]. The protein is thought to participate in the
regulation of visual phototransduction or in the integration of photo-
receptor metabolism. Similar proteins have been isolated from the pineal
gland [2]: the 33kDa proteins have the same sequences and the same
phosphorylation site, suggesting that the functional role of the protein
is the same in both retina and pineal gland. 

PHOSDUCIN is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
phosducins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL29.1 was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set. Two partial matches were found, both of which are phosducin-like
proteins: RATPHLPA and A49641 match motifs 4-8, and RATPHLPA also matches
motif 1. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 1
partial match.
