ENOLASE
Enolase (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase) is an essential glycolytic enzyme
that catalyses the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenol-
pyruvate [1,2]. In vertebrates, there are 3 different, tissue-specific
isoenzymes, designated alpha, beta and gamma: alpha is present in most
tissues; beta is localised in muscle tissue; and gamma is found only in
nervous tissue. The functional enzyme exists as a dimer of any 2 isoforms
[3]: in immature organs and in adult liver, it is usually an alpha homo-
dimer; in adult skeletal muscle, a beta homodimer; and in adult neurons, a
gamma homodimer; in developing muscle, it is usually an alpha/beta hetero-
dimer; and in the developing nervous system, an alpha/gamma heterodimer
[3]. The tissue specific forms display minor kinetic differences.

ENOLASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for enolases.
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the
motifs line the active site, motif 4 including the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern (PS00164), the first Asp of which is implicated in
magnesium ion binding. Two iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 31 sequences was 
identified. Four partial matches were also found, 3 of which are fragments,
the fourth (MBP1_HUMAN) being a c-myc promoter-binding protein known to
share regions of strong similarity with enolases.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 66 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
