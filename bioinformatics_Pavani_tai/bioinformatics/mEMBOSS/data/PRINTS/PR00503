BROMODOMAIN
The bromo domain is a conserved sequence motif of around 70 residues found
in a variety of mammalian, invertebrate and yeast DNA-binding proteins
[1-3]. In some proteins, the classical bromo domain has diverged to such an
extent that parts of the region are either missing or contain an insertion
(e.g., mammalian protein HRX, C.elegans hypothetical protein ZK783.4, yeast
protein YTA7). The bromo domain may occur as a single copy, or in duplicate.
The precise function of the domain is unclear, but it may be involved in
protein-protein interactions and may play a role in assembly or activity
of multi-component complexes involved in transcriptional activation.

BROMODOMAIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bromo domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 9
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full domain length and correspond to the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern BROMODOMAIN_1 (PS00633). Two iterations on OWL27.1 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 33 sequences
was identified. Several partial matches were also found. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 46 sequences, and 16
partial matches.
