LIGNINASE
Peroxidases are haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions.
Most haem peroxidases follow the reaction scheme:

Fe(3+) + H2O2            --> [Fe(4+)=O]R' (Compound I) + H2O
[Fe(4+)=O]R' + substrate --> [Fe(4+)=O]R (Compound II) + oxidised substrate
[Fe(4+)=O]R  + substrate -->  Fe(3+) + H2O + oxidised substrate

In this mechanism, the enzyme reacts with one equivalent of H2O2 to give 
[Fe(4+)=O]R' (compound I). This is a two-electron oxidation/reduction 
reaction where H2O2 is reduced to water and the enzyme is oxidised. One 
oxidising equivalent resides on iron, giving the oxyferryl [Fe(4+)=O] 
intermediate, while in many peroxidases the porphyrin (R) is oxidised to 
the porphyrin pi-cation radical (R'). Compound I then oxidises an organic 
substrate to give a substrate radical [1].

Peroxidases are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Fungal
ligninases, or lignin peroxidases (LiPs), and manganese-dependent
peroxidases (MnPs), are extracellular haem enzymes involved in the
degradation of lignin. In MnP, Mn(2+) serves as the reducing substrate [2].

It is commonly thought that the plant polymer lignin is the second most
abundant organic compound on Earth, exceeded only by cellulose [3]. Higher
plants synthesise vast quantities of insoluble macromolecules, including
lignins. Lignin is an amorphous three-dimensional aromatic biopolymer
composed of oxyphenylpropane units. Biodegradation of lignins is slow - it
is probable that their decomposition is the rate-limiting step in the
biospheric carbon-oxygen cycle, which is mediated almost entirely by the
catabolic activities of microorganisms. The white-rot fungi are able
extensively to decompose all the important structural components of wood,
including both cellulose and lignin. Under the proper environmental
conditions, white-rot fungi completely degrade all structural components of
lignin, with ultimate formation of CO2 and H2O [3]. The first step in lignin
degradation is depolymerisation, catalysed by the LiPs (ligninases). LiPs
are secreted, along with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), by white-rot fungi under
conditions of nutrient limitation. The enzymes are not only important in
lignin biodegradation, but are also potentially valuable in chemical waste
disposal because of their ability to degrade environmental pollutants [2,3]. 

To date, 3D structures have been determined for LiP [4] and MnP [8] from
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and for the fungal peroxidase from Arthromyces
ramosus [9]. All these proteins share the same architecture and consist 
of 2 all-alpha domains, between which is embedded the haem group. The
helical topography of LiPs is nearly identical to that of yeast cytochrome c
peroxidase (CCP) [1], despite the former having 4 disulphide bonds, which
are absent in CCP (MnP has an additional disulphide bond at the C-terminus).

LIGNINASE is a 14-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
fungal lignin peroxidase family. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. The invariant Cys
residues in motifs 1 and 2, 3 and 6, and 12 and 14 form 3 disulphide bonds;
the conserved Cys in motif 2 and invariant Cys in motif 13 form a fourth
disulphide bond in most LiPs. Motif 3 contains invariant active site 
residues (Arg, Phe and the "distal" His) that form a ligand pocket for 
hydrogen peroxide (cf. motif 1 of signature PEROXIDASE and PROSITE pattern
PEROXIDASE_2 (PS00436)); motifs 5 and 6 span helices C and D, respectively;
motifs 6 and 7 correspond to motifs 2 and 3 of signature PEROXIDASE; and
motif 9 contains the invariant "proximal" His, which serves the axial ligand 
of the haem iron, and spans the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
PEROXIDASE_1 (PS00435) (cf. motif 4 of signature PEROXIDASE). Two iterations
on OWL27.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 30 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also 
found, all of which are LiP fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 32 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
