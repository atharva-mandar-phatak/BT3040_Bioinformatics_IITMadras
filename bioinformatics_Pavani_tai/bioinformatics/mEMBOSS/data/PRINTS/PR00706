PYROGLUPTASE
Cysteine protease activity is dependent on an active dyad of cysteine and
histidine, the order and spacing of these residues varying in the 20 or so
known families. Families C1, C2 and C10 are loosely termed papain-like, and 
nearly half of all cysteine proteases are found exclusively in viruses [1].

Pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp or PYRase) is an exopeptidase that
hydrolytically removes the pGlu from pGlu-peptides or pGlu-proteins [2,3].
PYRase has been found in a variety of bacterial, plant and animal tissues.
At least two different classes have been characterised, the first
containing bacterial and animal type I PYRases, and the second containing
animal type II and serum PYRases. Type I and bacterial PYRases are soluble
enzymes, while type II PYRases are membrane-bound. The primary application
of PYRase has been its utilisation for protein or peptide sequencing, and
bacterial diagnosis [3]. The conserved residues Cys-144 and His-168 have 
been identified by inhibition and mutagenesis studies [2,4].

PYROGLUPTASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
pyroglutamyl peptidase I (C15) protease family. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the N-terminal two-thirds of the alignment -
motif 4 contains the active Cys residue and motif 5 contains the active His.
Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 1
partial match.
