ACTIN
Actin [1,2] is a ubiquitous protein involved in the formation of filaments
that are major components of the cytoskeleton. These filaments interact 
with myosin to produce a sliding effect, which is the basis of muscular
contraction and many aspects of cell motility, including cytokinesis. Each
actin protomer binds one molecule of ATP and has one high affinity site for
either calcium or magnesium ions, as well as several low affinity sites.
Actin exists as a monomer in low salt concentrations, but filaments form
rapidly as salt concentration rises, with the consequent hydrolysis of ATP.
Actin from many sources forms a tight complex with deoxyribonuclease
(DNase I) although the significance of this is still unknown. The formation
of this complex results in the inhibition of DNase I activity, and actin
loses its ability to polymerise. It has been shown that an ATPase domain
of actin shares similarity with ATPase domains of hexokinase and hsp70
proteins [3,4].

ACTIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
actins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 19 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern ACTINS_1 (PS00406). Three iterations on OWL17.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 94
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, most of
which are actin fragments. Two (ACT_OXYFA and OFAACTIN), however, are
complete sequences in which 2 of the motifs significantly overlap, and are
therefore not correctly resolved by the method.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 223 sequences, and 27
partial matches.
