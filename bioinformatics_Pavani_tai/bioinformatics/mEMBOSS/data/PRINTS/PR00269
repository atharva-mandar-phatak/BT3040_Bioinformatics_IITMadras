PTNMIDKINE
Pleiotrophin is a heparin-binding protein that has neurotrophic activity
[1] and has mitogenic activity towards fibroblasts [2]. It is highly 
expressed in brain and uterus tissues, but is also found in gut, muscle and
skin: it is thought to possess an important brain-specific function [1].
Midkine is a regulator of differentiation whose expression is regulated by
retinoic acid, and, like pleiotrophin, is a heparin-binding growth/
differentiation factor that acts on fibroblasts and nerve cells [3].
Pleiotrophin and midkine have similar amino acid sequences, with 8 
conserved cysteine residues, and are likely to have similar 3D folds [1].

PTNMIDKINE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
pleiotrophin/midkine protein family. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 4 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 include regions
encoded by PROSITE patterns PTNMK_1 (PS00619) and PTNMK_2 (PS00620), and
motif 3 spans a region containing a conserved Cys residue. Two iterations
on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 7 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
