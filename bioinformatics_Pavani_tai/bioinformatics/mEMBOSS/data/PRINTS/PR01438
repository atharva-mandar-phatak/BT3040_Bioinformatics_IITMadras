UNVRSLSTRESS
Transcriptional induction of the uspA gene of Escherichia coli occurs
when conditions cause growth arrest; cells deficient in UspA survive
poorly in stationary phase [1]. The product of uspA has been shown to be
a cytoplasmic serine and threonine phosphoprotein [1]. Members of the Usp
family are predicted to be related to the MADS-box proteins and bind to DNA
[1]. Some members of the family contain 2 copies of the domain. 

The structure of a UspA homologue from Methanococcus jannaschii from has 
been determined to 1.8Å resolution by using its selenomethionyl derivative
and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction [2]. The protein homodimerises in 
the crystal; each monomer adopts an open-twisted 5-stranded parallel beta-
sheet with 2 helices on each side of the sheet [2]. Although the structure
co-crystallised with ATP, the function of the protein is unknown.

UNVRSLSTRESS is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
UspA proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 9
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length and include residues known to interact with ATP -
motif 1 spans strand 1 and helix 1; motif 2 includes strand 4; and motif 3
spans helix 5 and strand 5. Four iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 25 sequences was 
identified. Several partial matches were found, all of which are
hypothetical proteins that fail to make significant matches with motif 2.
