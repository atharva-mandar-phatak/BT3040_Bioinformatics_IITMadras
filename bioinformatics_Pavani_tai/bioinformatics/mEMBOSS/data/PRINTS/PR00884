RIBOSOMALHS6
The sequence of the acidic ribosomal protein S6 from Halobacterium
marismortui has been determined [1]. The protein consists of 116 amino acid
residues, and has a molecular mass of 12,251 Da. Sequence comparison with
ribosomal proteins of other organisms has revealed that halobacterial
protein S6 is similar to mammalian protein L7a [2], yeast L4 [3], yeast NHP2
[4], B.subtilis hypothetical protein ylxQ and M.jannaschii MJ1203.

RIBOSOMALHS6 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the HS6-like family of ribosomal proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved sections spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing
on those regions that characterise the ribosomal HS6-like proteins but
distinguish them from the rest of the high mobility group-like family. A
single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match
was found, S11615, a Halobacterium HS14 ribosomal protein fragment that
matches motifs 1 and 2. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
