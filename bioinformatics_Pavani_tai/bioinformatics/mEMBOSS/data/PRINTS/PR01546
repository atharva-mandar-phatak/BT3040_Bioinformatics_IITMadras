YEAST73DUF
The sequence of a 6.8kb DNA fragment from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
chromosome VII has been analysed [1]. The sequence was found to contain
five open reading frames (ORFs) greater than 100 amino acids in length. One 
of these (a 73.5kDa protein) shares similarity with the 58.0kDa SPAC1D4.03C
from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and with hypothetical proteins from Homo 
sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Fugu rubripes. 

The sequences are characterised by a variable N-terminal domain and a more
conserved C-terminal domain. They share no similarity with any other known, 
functionally or structurally characterised proteins. 

YEAST73DUF is a 13-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae 73.5kDa protein and related proteins. The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs
were drawn from conserved regions spanning the C-terminal portion of the
alignment. A single iteration on SPTR39_15f was required to reach 
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
