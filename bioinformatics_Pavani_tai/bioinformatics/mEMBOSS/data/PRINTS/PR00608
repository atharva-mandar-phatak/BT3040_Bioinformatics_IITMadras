CYTCHROMECII
Cytochromes c (cyt c) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having 
one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more 
generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine 
residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine 
residue. Cyt c possess a wide range of properties and function in a large 
number of different redox processes [1]. 

Ambler [2] recognised four classes of cyt c. Class II includes the 
high-spin cyt c' and a number of low-spin cytochromes, e.g. cyt c-556. 
The haem-attachment site is close to the C-terminus. The cyt c' are capable
of binding such ligands as CO, NO or CN(-), albeit with rate and equilibrium
constants 100 to 1,000,000-fold smaller than other high-spin haemoproteins
[3]; this, coupled with its relatively low redox potential, makes it
unlikely that cyt c' is a terminal oxidase. Thus cyt c' probably functions
as an electron transfer protein [4]. 

The 3D structures of a number of cyt c' have been determined. The molecule 
usually exists as a dimer, each monomer folding as a four-alpha-helix bundle
incorporating a covalently-bound haem group at the core [4]. The Chromatium
vinosum cyt c' exhibits dimer dissociation upon ligand binding [5]. 

CYTCHROMECII is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
class II cyt c. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
17 sequences: the motifs were drawn from adjacent conserved regions in
the C-terminal part of the molecule - motif 2 includes two invariant Cys
residues, which covalently bind the haem group, and a His residue, which
provides the haem iron axial ligand (cf. PROSITE pattern CYTOCHROME_C).
Two iterations on OWL28.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 19 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences.
