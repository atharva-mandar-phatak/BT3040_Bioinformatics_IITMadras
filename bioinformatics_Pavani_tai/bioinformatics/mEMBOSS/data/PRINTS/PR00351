OM20RECEPTOR
Virtually all mitochondrial precursors are imported via the same 
mechanism [1]: precursors first bind to receptors on the mitochondrial
surface, then insert into the translocation channel in the outer membrane.
Many outer-membrane proteins participate in the early stages of import,
4 of which (MAS20, MAS22, MAS37 and MAS70) are components of the receptor.
MAS20, which forms a subcomplex with MAS22, seems to interact with most or
all mitochondrial precursors, suggesting that the protein binds directly
to mitochondrial targeting sequences. The MAS37 and MAS70 components also
form a subcomplex, the 2 subcomplexes possibly binding via their trans-
membrane (TM) regions - the TM region of MAS70 promotes oligomerisation
of attatched protein domains and shares sequence similarity with the
TM region of MAS20 [2]. 

OM20RECEPTOR is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
MAS20 (TOM20) import receptor subunit. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 38 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f 
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 50
sequences was identified. Four partial matches were also found, all of
which are TOM20-like proteins that fail to make significant matches with
motifs 1 or 2.
