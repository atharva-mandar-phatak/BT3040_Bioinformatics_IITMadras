ROYALJELLY
The major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) comprise 12.5% of the mass [1], and
82-90% of the protein content [2], of honeybee (Apis mellifera) royal jelly.
Royal jelly is a substance secreted by the cephalic glands of nurse bees [1]
and it is used to trigger development of a queen bee from a bee larva. The
biological function of the MRJPs is unknown, but they are believed to play a
major role in nutrition due to their high essential amino acid content [3].
Two royal jelly proteins, MRJP3 and MRJP5, contain a tandem repeat that
results from a high genetic variablility. This polymorphism may be useful 
for genotyping individual bees [3].

ROYALJELLY is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for major 
royal jelly proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
N-terminal half of the alignment, avoiding the variable repeat regions. A
single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no 
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
