HSVINTEGRLMP
The equine Herpesvirus EHV1 protein belongs to a family of sequences that
groups together HSV1 UL10, EHV1 52, VZV 50, EBV BBRF3, HVS1 39 and HCMV
UL100. Little is yet known about the properties of the protein. However,
its amino acid sequence is highly hydrophobic, containing 8 putative
membrane-spanning regions, and it is therefore believed to be either
membrane-associated or transmembrane.

HSVINTEGRLMP is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Herpesvirus integral membrane proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL21.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences.
