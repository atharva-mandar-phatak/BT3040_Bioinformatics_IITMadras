G3PDHDRGNASE
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays an important role in
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis [1] by reversibly catalysing the oxidation
and phosphorylation of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-diphospho-
glycerate. The enzyme exists as a tetramer of identical subunits, each
containing 2 conserved functional domains: an NAD-binding domain, and a
highly conserved catalytic domain [2]. The enzyme has been found to bind to
actin and tropomyosin, and may thus have a role in cytoskeleton assembly.
Alternatively, the cytoskeleton may provide a framework for precise
positioning of the glycolytic enzymes, thus permitting efficient passage
of metabolites from enzyme to enzyme [2].

G3PDHDRGNASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs surround the active site,
motif 2 including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern GAPDH (PS00071),
the Cys residue of which is implicated in the catalytic activity. Two
iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a 
true set comprising 130 sequences was identified. Five partial matches were
also found, all of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 175 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
