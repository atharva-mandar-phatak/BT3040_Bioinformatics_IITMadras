LIPOLPP20
A major antigen has been recognised in Helicobacter pylori, a protein 
with an apparent molecular weight of 20,000 and mass 18,283 Da [1]. DNA
sequence analysis revealed a 525 bp gene, encoding a 175-amino acid residue
product with a typical 21-residue lipoprotein signal peptide and consensus
prolipoprotein processing site [1]. Results of experimental work with Lpp20
are consistent with it being a nonessential lipoprotein [1]. 

Prokaryotic membrane lipoproteins are synthesised with precursor signal
peptides that are cleaved by specific peptidases (signal peptidase II). The
enzyme recognises a conserved sequence, cutting upstream of a cysteine 
residue to which a glyceride-fatty acid lipid is attached [2].

LIPOLPP20 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Lpp20 lipoprotein precursor. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the signal peptide and
includes the Cys residue that constitutes the lipid attachement site. A
single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further 
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.


An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
