CUTICLE
Insect cuticle is composed of proteins and chitin. The cuticular proteins
appear to be specific to the type of cuticle (i.e., flexible or stiff)  
occurring at different stages of insect development. Proteins found in
the flexible cuticle of larvae and pupae, the soft endocuticle of adult
insects [1], and arachnid cuticule [2], share a conserved C-terminal region
[3]. In addition, cuticular proteins share hydrophobic regions dominated by
tetrapeptide repeats (A-A-P-A/V), which are presumed to be functionally
important [2,4]. 

CUTICLE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for insect
cuticular proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions in the
central portion of the alignment - motifs 2 and 3 include the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern CUTICLE (PS00233). Three iterations on OWL30.2
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
56 sequences was identified. Six partial matches were also found, all of
which are insect cuticle proteins that fail to make a significant match
with motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 61 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
