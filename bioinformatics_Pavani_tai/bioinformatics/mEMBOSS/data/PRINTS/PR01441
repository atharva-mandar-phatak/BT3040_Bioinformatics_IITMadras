CELLSNTHASEC
An operon encoding 4 proteins required for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis
(bcs) in Acetobacter xylinum has been isolated via genetic complementation
with strains lacking cellulose synthase activity [1]. Nucleotide sequence
analysis showed the cellulose synthase operon to consist of 4 genes, 
designated bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD [1], all of which are required for 
maximal bacterial cellulose synthesis in A.xylinum [1]. 

The calculated molecular mass of the protein encoded by bcsC is 141.0kDa [1].
The function of BcsC is unknown. The sequence shares a high degree of
similarity with E.coli YhjL.

CELLSNTHASEC is a 15-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
cellulose synthase subunit C. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved, largely
hydrophobic, regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iterations on SPTR39_14f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were
also found: Q9WX71 is Acetobacter xylinum BCSCII protein, which matches
motifs 3, 5, 7, 14 and 15; and YHJL_ECOLI is an E.coli hypothetical 128.7kDa 
protein that matches motifs 6 and 14.
