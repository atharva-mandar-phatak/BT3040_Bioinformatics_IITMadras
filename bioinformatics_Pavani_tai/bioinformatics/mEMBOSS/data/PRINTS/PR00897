VASOPRSNV1BR
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a vast protein family that 
encompasses a wide range of functions (including various autocrine, para-
crine and endocrine processes). They show considerable diversity at the 
sequence level, on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct 
groups. We use the term clan to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group
of families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship, 
but between which there is no statistically significant similarity in 
sequence [1,2]. The currently known clan members include the rhodopsin-like 
GPCRs, the secretin-like GPCRs, the cAMP receptors, the fungal mating
pheromone receptors, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor family.

The rhodopsin-like GPCRs themselves represent a widespread protein family 
that includes hormone, neurotransmitter and light receptors, all of
which transduce extracellular signals through interaction with guanine
nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Although their activating ligands vary 
widely in structure and character, the amino acid sequences of the 
receptors are very similar and are believed to adopt a common structural 
framework comprising 7 transmembrane (TM) helices [3-5]. 

Vasopressin and oxytocin are members of the neurohypophyseal hormone family
found in all mammalian species [6]. They are present in high levels in the
posterior pituitary. Vasopressin has an essential role in the control of 
the water content of the body, acting in the kidney to increase water and
sodium absorption [6]. In higher concentrations, vasopressin stimulates
contraction of vascular smooth muscle, stimulates glycogen breakdown in the
liver, induces platelet activation, and evokes release of corticotrophin 
from the anterior pituitary [6]. Vasopressin and its analogues are used
clinically to treat diabetes insipidus [6]. 

In the periphery, the V1A receptor is found in high levels in vascular
smooth muscle, myometrium and the bladder where it mediates contraction [6].
V1B receptors can be distinguished from V1A receptors by the low affinity of
certain antagonists at the former. The receptors stimulate phosphoinositide
metabolism and are found in the anterior pituitary [6].

VASOPRSNV1BR is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
vasopressin V1B receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
sections spanning the full alignment length, focusing on those regions
that characterise the vasopressin V1B receptors but distinguish them from
the rest of the vasopressin family - motif 1 lies at the N-terminus; motif 2
lies in the second cytoplasmic loop; motif 3 lies in the second external 
loop; motifs 4 and 5 span the third cytoplasmic loop; motif 6 lies in the
third external loop; and motifs 7-9 reside in the C-terminal domain. A 
single iteration on OWL30.1 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
