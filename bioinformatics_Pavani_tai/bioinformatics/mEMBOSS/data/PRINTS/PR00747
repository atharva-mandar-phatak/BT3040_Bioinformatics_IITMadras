GLYHDRLASE47
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 47 encompasses the alpha-mannosidases [5]. 

Alpha-mannosidase is involved in the maturation of Asn-linked oligo-
saccharides [5]. The enzyme hydrolyses terminal 1,2-linked alpha-D-mannose
residues in the oligo-mannose oligosaccharide man(9)(glcnac)(2) in a 
calcium-dependent manner. The mannose residues are trimmed away to produce, 
first, man(8)glcnac(2), then a man(5)(glcnac)(2) structure. 

GLHYDRLASE48 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 47 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the putative lumenal domain - motif 3 includes part of the
potential calcium binding site. Three iterations on OWL29.3 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 19 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, S61631, a yeast
hypothetical membrane protein that matches motifs 2, 3, 7 and 8.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 1
partial match.
