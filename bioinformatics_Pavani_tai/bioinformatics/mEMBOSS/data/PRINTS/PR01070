ACCCTRFRASEB
Fatty acid synthesis involves a set of reactions, commencing with 
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA [1]. This is an irreversible
reaction, catalysed by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (EC 6.4.1.2); a
heterohexamer of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase and two
non-identical carboxyl transferase subunits (alpha and beta) in a 2:2
association [1,2]. 

The reaction involves two steps: 

(1) Biotin carrier protein + ATP + HCO(3)(-) <=>
	    Carboxybiotin carrier protein + ADP + Phosphate

(2) Carboxybiotin carrier protein + Acetyl-CoA ->
	    Malonyl-CoA + Biotin carrier protein

In the first step, biotin carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of the
carrier protein to form an intermediate. Next, the transcarboxylase complex
transfers the carboxyl group from the intermediate to acetyl-CoA forming
malonyl-CoA.

ACCCTRFRASEB is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
acetyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl transferase beta subunit. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions within the central and C-terminal portions of the
alignment. Three iterations on OWL31.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 23 sequences was identified. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are transferase beta subunit
fragments that lack portions of sequence bearing one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 23 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
