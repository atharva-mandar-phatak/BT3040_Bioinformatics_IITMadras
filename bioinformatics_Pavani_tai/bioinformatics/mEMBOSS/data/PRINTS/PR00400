TETREPRESSOR
Several resistance mechanisms have been developed by Gram-negative
bacteria against the broad-spectrum antibiotic tetracycline (Tc) [1].
A common mechanism involves a membrane-associated protein (TetA) that
exports the antibiotic out of the cell before it can attach to ribosomes
and inhibit polypeptide chain growth. TetA expression is regulated by
the Tet repressor (TetR). TetR occurs as a homodimer and uses 2 HTH
motifs to bind tandem DNA operators, thereby blocking the expression
of the associated genes, TetA and TetR.

The structure of the class D TetR repressor protein [2] involves 10
alpha-helices, with connecting turns and loops. The 3 N-terminal
helices constitute the DNA-binding HTH domain, which has an inverse
orientation compared with HTH motifs in other DNA-binding proteins.
The core of the protein, formed by helices 5-10, is responsible for
dimerisation and contains, for each monomer, a binding pocket that
accommodates Tc in the presence of a divalent cation. 

TETREPRESSOR is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the Tet repressor proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
within both the HTH and Tc-binding domains - motif 1 spans helices 2 and
3; motif 2 encodes helix 5; motif 3 spans helix 6 and part of helix 7;
and motifs 4 and 5 include parts of helices 8 and 10 respectively. Two
iterations on OWL25.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. Three partial matches
were also found: A40046 is a TetR repressor homologue that fails to make
a significant match with motif 3; and A26948 and S02668 are TetR protein
fragments lacking C-terminal portions of sequence bearing the final motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
