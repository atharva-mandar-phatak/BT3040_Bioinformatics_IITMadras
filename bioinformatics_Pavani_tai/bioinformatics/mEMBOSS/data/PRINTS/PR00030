HTHCRO
The cro family comprises a set of small, single-domain DNA binding proteins
that regulate phage transcription by binding to DNA in a sequence-specific 
manner using a characteristic helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif [1]. The motif 
occurs between residues 16-35: it consists of 2 alpha-helices joined by a 
short turn that contains a critically conserved glycine (position 9 in
the motif). The second helix binds to DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds 
and hydrophobic interactions, which occur between specific side chains and 
the exposed bases and thymine methyl groups within the major groove of the 
DNA [3]. The first helix helps to stabilise the structure [4]. This motif 
is very similar in sequence and structure to the N-terminal region of the 
lamda [2] and other repressor proteins, and has also been identified in 
many other DNA-binding proteins on the basis of sequence and structure 
similarity [1]. 

HTHCRO is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of cro repressors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs span the complete motif and hinge on
the conserved glycine. Two iterations on OWL19.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 15 sequences was
identified. One cro sequence was not found, RCRO_BPP22, which appears
to be more similar to other repressor proteins than to the cro family.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
