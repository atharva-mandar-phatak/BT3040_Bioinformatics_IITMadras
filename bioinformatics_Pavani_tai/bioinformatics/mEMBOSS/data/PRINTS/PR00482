OMPTIN
The omptin family comprises a number of novel outer membrane-associated
serine proteases that are distinct from trypsin-like proteases in that 
they cleave polypeptides between 2 basically-charged amino acids [1]. The
enzyme is sensitive to the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluoro-
phosphate, to divalent cations such as Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+ [1], and is
temperature regulated, activity decreasing at lower temperatures [1,2].
Temperature regulation is most prominantly shown in the Yersinia pestis
coagulase/fibrinolysin protein, where coagulase activity is prevalent 
below 30 degrees Celsius, and fibrinolysin (protease) activity is prevalent
above this point, the optimum temperature being 37 degrees [3]. It is
possible that this assists in 'flea blockage' and transmission of the
bacteria to animals [3].

OMPTIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the omptin
family of serine proteases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 4 and 5 including the
central regions encoded by PROSITE patterns OMPTIN_1 (PS00834) and OMPTIN_2
(PS00835). Two iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
