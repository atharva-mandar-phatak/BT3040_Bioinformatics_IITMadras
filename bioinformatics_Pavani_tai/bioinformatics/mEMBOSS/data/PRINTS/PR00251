BACTRLOPSIN
The bacterial opsins are retinal-binding proteins that provide light-
dependent ion transport and sensory functions to a family of halophilic 
bacteria [1,2]. They are integral membrane proteins believed to contain
7 transmembrane (TM) domains, the last of which contains the attachment
point for retinal (a conserved lysine). There are several classes of these
bacterial proteins: they include bacteriorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin,
which are light-driven proton pumps; halorhodopsin, a light-driven 
chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both photoattractant
(in the red) and photophobic (in the UV) responses.
 
BACTRLOPSIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial opsins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the 7 putative membrane-
spanning domains - motif 3 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
BACTERIAL_OPSIN_1 (PS00950), which contains a functionally important Arg
residue, and motif 7 encompasses the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
BACTERIAL_OPSIN_RET (PS00327), which contains the retinal-binding lysine.
Two iterations on OWL21.2 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified. A single partial
match was also found, a halorhodopsin fragment [3] lacking the first and
the seventh TM domains.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
