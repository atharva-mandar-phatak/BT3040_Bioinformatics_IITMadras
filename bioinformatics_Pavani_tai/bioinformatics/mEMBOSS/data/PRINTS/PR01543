ANATRNSFRASE
N-acetylation by hepatic arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is a major 
route in the metabolism and detoxification of various drugs and foreign 
chemicals [1]. NAT catalyses the reaction:

           Acetyl-coA + arylamine = coA + N-acetylarylamine

NAT is the target of a common genetic polymorphism of clinical relevance in
humans [1]. The N-acetylation polymorphism is determined by low or high NAT
activity in liver [2]. NAT has been implicated in the action and toxicity 
of amine-containing drugs, and in the susceptibility to cancer [3] and
systematic lupus erythematosus. Two highly similar human genes for NAT, 
termed NAT1 and NAT2, encode genetically invariant and variant NAT proteins,
respectively [2].

ANATRNSFRASE is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
arylamine N-acetyltransferases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 14 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 3 includes the active
site cysteine residue. A single iteration on SPTR39_15f was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting
set. Two true partial matches were found: NAT_MYCSM is an arylamine
N-acetyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis that matches motifs 1-4
and 7; and NAT_MYCTU is an arylamine N-acetyltransferase from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis that matches motifs 1 and 2.
