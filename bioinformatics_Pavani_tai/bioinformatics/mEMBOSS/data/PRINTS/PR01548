MEIOTICR114
REC114 is one of 10 genes required for initiation of meiotic recombination 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. Located on chromosome XIII, it is 
transcribed only in meiosis and has no detectable function in mitosis [2]. 

REC114 has been shown to possess an intron and is one of only three genes
in yeast with 3' introns [1]. The 3' splice site utilised in REC114 is a
very rare AAG sequence - only three other genes in yeast use this non-
consensus sequence [1]. It appears that the intron is not essential for
expression of REC114 and is not absolutely required for meiotic function.
Nevertheless, it is conserved in evolution - two other species of yeast 
contain an intron at the same location in their REC114 genes [1]. 

MEIOTICR114 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Saccharomyces meiotic recombination REC114 protein. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from short conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length.
A single iteration on SPTR39_15f was required to reach convergence, no 
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
