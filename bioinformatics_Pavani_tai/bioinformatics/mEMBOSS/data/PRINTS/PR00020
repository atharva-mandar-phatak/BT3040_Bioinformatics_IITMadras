MAMDOMAIN
A 170-amino acid domain (the so-called MAM domain) has been recognised in 
the extracellular region of functionally diverse proteins [1]. These 
proteins have a modular, receptor-like architecture comprising a signal 
peptide, an N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain 
and an intracellular domain - such proteins include meprin (a cell surface
glycoprotein) [2]; A5 antigen (a developmentally-regulated cell surface 
protein) [3]; and receptor-like tyrosine protein phosphatase [4]. The MAM
domain is thought to have an adhesive function. It contains 4 conserved
cysteine residues, which probably form disulphide bridges.

MAMDOMAIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
MAM domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length, and include two of the conserved Cys residues - motifs 2 
and 3 span the region encoded by PROSITE pattern MAM (PS00740), which
contains the third conserved Cys. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required 
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, a hypothetical
protein lacking significant matches with motifs 2 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 19 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
