LMWPTPASE
Low molecular weight (LMW) phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (or acid
phosphatase) acts on tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, low-MW aryl
phosphates and natural and synthetic acyl phosphates [1,2]. It is a
cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyses the reaction:
protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein tyrosine + orthophosphate.

The structure of the protein has been solved by NMR [3]. It belongs to the
alpha/beta class, with 6 alpha-helices and 4 beta-strands forming a 3-layer
alpha-beta-alpha sandwich architecture.

LMWPTPASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for LMW
phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the first beta-
strand and the N-terminus of the first helix; motif 2 includes helix 3;
motifs 3 and 4 include the third and fourth beta-strands; and motif 5 
includes the N-terminus of helix 6. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
fragments (e.g., YRP2_SYNPY) or family members that fail to make signficant
matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 14 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
