INHIBINBA
Inhibins and activins are dimeric peptide hormones that regulate circulating
levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [1,2]. In turn, FSH stimulates
inhibin gene expression in the ovarian follicle [2]; this effect is
probably mediated by cAMP [3]. Inhibin is a heterodimer, linked by one or
more disulphide bonds: inhibin A is a dimer of alpha and beta-A chains;
inhibin B is a dimer of alpha and beta-B; activin A is a dimer of beta-A;
and activin AB is a dimer of beta-A and beta-B. Inhibins belong to a gene
family that also includes transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [3].

INHIBINBA is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
inhibin beta-A chains. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the N-terminal two-thirds of the alignment. A single iteration
on OWL29.1 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found, both
of which are fragments: S31682 is an inhibin beta-A chain and JC2429 is
an activin-A protein.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 1
partial match.
