ONCOGENEAML1
The AML1 gene is rearranged by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid
leukemia [1]. The gene is highly similar to the Drosophila segmentation 
gene runt and to the mouse transcription factor PEBP2 alpha subunit gene [1].
The region of shared similarity, known as the Runt domain, is responsible 
for DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction [1]. 

In addition to the highly-conserved Runt domain, the AML-1 gene product
carries a putative ATP-binding site (GRSGRGKS), and has a C-terminal region
rich in proline and serine residues. The protein (known as acute myeloid 
leukemia 1 protein, oncogene AML-1, core-binding factor (CBF), alpha-B 
subunit, etc.) binds to the core site, 5'-pygpyggt-3', of a number of
enhancers and promoters. 

The protein is a heterodimer of alpha- and beta-subunits. The alpha-subunit
binds DNA as a monomer, and appears to have a role in the development of
normal hematopoiesis. CBF is a nuclear protein expressed in numerous tissue
types, except brain and heart; highest levels have been found to occur in 
thymus, bone marrow and peripheral blood.

ONCOGENEAML1 is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (oncogene AML-1). The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 16 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motifs
1-6 span the Runt domain, motif 5 encoding a putative ATP-binding site; 
and motifs 7-10, which are Ser/Thr/Pro-rich regions, lie towards the
C-terminus. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several
partial matches were found, all of which lie in the Runt domain.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
