CALPONIN
Calponin is a smooth muscle-specific, actin-, tropomyosin- and calmodulin-
binding protein believed to be involved in regulation or modulation of 
contraction [1,2]; interaction of the protein with actin inhibits actomyosin 
MgATPase activity. Multiple isoforms are found in smooth muscle [2].

Calponin is a basic protein of ~34kDa [3]. The protein contains three 
repeats of a well-conserved 26-residue domain, which is also found in a 
variety of proteins whose physiological role is as yet unclear (these 
include vertebrate smooth muscle protein, Drosophila synchronous flight 
muscle protein, C.elegans unc-87 protein, and rat neuronal protein NP25).

CALPONIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
calponins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved sections, focusing
on those regions that characterise the calponins but distinguish them from
the rest of the SM22/calponin family - motif 4 includes the C-terminus of
the first calponin domain repeat; motif 5 lies within the second domain
repeat and includes the central part of the region encoded by PROSITE 
pattern CALPONIN (PS01052); and motif 6 includes the third repeat. Two 
iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are fragments and/or SM22/calponin family
members that fail to match one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
