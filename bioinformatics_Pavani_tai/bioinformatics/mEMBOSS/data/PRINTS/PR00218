PERIPHERNRDS
The outer segments of vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells are specialised 
organelles that function in the transduction of light into electrical
signals as part of the visual excitation process [1]. These organelles
contain thousands of closely-stacked disk membranes, which have distinctly
different protein compositions in their lamellar and rim regions [1]: the
lamellae are host to the visual receptors, while peripherin and a similar
protein, Rom1, which span the membrane 4 times, are localised in the rims
[1]. Although the function of these proteins is unknown, they may play a
part in disk biogenesis, possibly anchoring the disk to the cytoskeleton
of the rod cell [1,2]. Deletion mutations cause serious visual disorders,
including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, autosomal dominant
punctata albescens and butterfly macular degeneration [1].

PERIPHERNRDS is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
RDS/ROM1 peripherin family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 4 sequences: motifs 1-3 and 6 span the 4 transmembrane (TM)
regions; and motifs 4 and 5 correspond to highly-conserved regions in
the hydrophilic loop between TM domains 3 and 4 - motif 5 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern RDS_ROM1 (PS00930), which contains 3
of 7 totally conserved cysteines. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
