PMYELIN22
The epithelial membrane proteins (EMP-1, -2 and -3), peripheral myelin 
protein 22 (PMP22), and lens fiber membrane intrinsic protein (LMIP)
comprise a protein family on the basis of sequence and structural 
similarities [1]. Each family member is a small hydrophobic membrane
glycoprotein, ~160-170 amino acids in length, and shares a common predicted
transmembrane (TM) topology of 4 TM domains, with intracellular N- and 
C-termini [2]. 

PMP22, also termed growth-arrest specific protein (GAS3), is a structural
component of compact myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrant
expression of the PMP22 gene, and mutations in the protein, are associated 
with a variety of hereditary peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies [3].
An intra-chromosomal duplication containing the PMP22 gene is found in the
majority of patients suffering from the autosomal dominant demyelinating
neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A) [4]. In addition, rare 
point mutations in PMP22 have been found in non-duplication CMT1A patients
and in the severe congenital peripheral neuropathy Dejerine-Sottas
syndrome [5].

PMP22 is also implicated in the control of cell proliferation. Its
expression levels are up-regulated in cells undergoing growth arrest [1],
and it has been shown that modulating PMP22 levels in cultured Schwann
cells exerts a profound effect on the length of the G1 phase of the cell
cycle [6]. It has also been demonstrated that over-expression of PMP22 in
NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells induces apoptosis [7].

PMYELIN22 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
peripheral myelin protein PMP22. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved TM and loop
regions, focusing on those sections that characterise peripheral myelin 
protein PMP22 but distinguish it from other family members - motif 1 lies in
the first extracellular loop; motif 2 resides within TM domain 2; motif 3
lies in TM domain 3; and motif 4 resides in the second extracellular loop.
A single iteration on SPTR39_14f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
