ZONOCCLUDNS1
Zona occludens (ZO), or tight junctions (TJ), are specialised membrane 
domains found at the most apical region of polarised epithelial and endo-
thelial cells that create a primary barrier, preventing paracellular 
transport of solutes, and restricting the lateral diffusion of membrane 
lipids and proteins, thus maintaining cellular polarity [1]. Under freeze-
fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a network of continuous 
anastomosing intramembranous strands. These strands consist mainly of 
claudins and occludin, which are transmembrane proteins that polymerise 
within plasma membranes to form fibrils [2].

The zona occludens proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3) are a family of TJ- 
associated proteins that function as cross-linkers, anchoring the TJ strand 
proteins to the actin-based cytoskeleton [3,4]. Each protein contains three 
PDZ (postsynaptic density, disc-large, ZO-1) domains, a single SH3 (Src 
Homology-3) domain and a GK (guanylate kinase) domain, the presence of which
identifies them as members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase 
(MAGUK) protein family. They also share an acidic domain at the C-terminal 
region of the molecules not found in other MAGUK proteins. It has been
demonstrated that the first PDZ domain is involved in binding the C-terminal
-Y-V motif of claudins [4]. By contrast, the occludin-binding domain of 
ZO-1 has been shown to lie in the GK and acidic domains [5]. Although the
precise location of the actin-binding motif has not been elucidated, it
appears to be within the C-terminal half of the molecules, since
transfection of this region into fibroblasts induces co-localisation
of ZO-1 and ZO-2 with actin fibres [5].

ZO-1 was first identified as a 220kDa antigen for a monoclonal antibody
raised to junction-enriched cell fractions [6]. The protein shares ~65% 
overall similarity with ZO-2 and ZO-3 proteins, with highest levels of 
similarity in the MAGUK and acid domains. The structure of ZO-1 is distinct
from the other ZO protein family members in that it contains a ZU5 domain 
at the C-terminal end of the molecule, although the function of this domain
is unknown. Binding and tranfection studies indicate that ZO-1 is capable 
of associating with ZO-2 and ZO-3 through binding of the second PDZ domains
[7,8].

ZONOCCLUDNS1 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for zona
occludens protein ZO-1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections 
that characterise ZO-1 but distinguish it from other family members - motifs
1 and 2 lie between the second and third PDZ domains; and motifs 3 and 4 
reside between the GK domain and the ZU5 domain in the C-terminal part of 
the alignment. A single iteration on SPTR39.22_17.3f was required to reach 
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
