V8PROTEASE
In a number of prokaryotic proteases the catalytic activity is provided by
a charge relay system analagous to that of the trypsin family of serine
proteases, but which probably evolved by independent convergent evolution
[1,2]. The sequences around the catalytic residues (Asp, Ser and His) are 
completely different from those of the corresponding residues in trypsin
serine proteases. 

These proteins belong to family S2B of the peptidase classification system
[3]. Members include S.aureus V8 protease, which preferentially cleaves
peptide bonds C-terminal to Asp and Glu residues; B.licheniformis glutamate-
specific endopeptidase [4], which also cleaves on the C-terminal side of 
acidic residues, but with strong preference for glutamate; B.subtilis
extracellular "metalloprotease" [5]; and S.aureus exfoliative (or 
epidermolytic) toxins A and B, which cause impetigous diseases (also known
as Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome).

V8PROTEASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
V8 family of serine proteases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 2 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern V8_HIS (PS00672), which contains the
active site His; and motif 5 spans the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
V8_SER (PS00673), which includes the active site serine. A single iteration
on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being 
identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches were also found, 
all of which appear to be related proteases that match motif 5, and most of
which also match motif 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
