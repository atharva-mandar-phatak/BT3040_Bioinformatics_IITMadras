PORPHBDMNASE
Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), or hydroxymethylbilane synthase, is the
third enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of tetrapyrroles, which include
the vitally important macrocyles haem, chlorophyll and corrin [1]. PBGD
catalyses the head-to-tail polymerisation of 4 molecules of porpho-
bilinogen to assemble the open chain tetrapyrole, hydroxymethylbilane.

PBGD is a ubiquitously occurring, monomeric protein, showing high sequence
conservation among proteins from bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals. The
protein contains a dipyrromethane cofactor, which is covalently attached
to a cysteine side chain. The structure of PBGD shows the same chain fold
as proteins from 2 classes of binding protein: the transferrins and the
group-II periplasmic receptors (the sulphate-, phosphate-, maltodextrin-
and lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding proteins). Despite structural
similarities, there is no significant identity between their sequences.

PORPHBDMNASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
porphobilinogen deaminases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length, motif 5 including the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern PORPHOBILINOGEN_DEAM (PS00533), which contains the
conserved Cys residue responsible for cofactor binding. Two iterations
on OWL25.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 16 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were
also found, NRL_1PDA2 and HEM3_YERIN, both PBGD fragments, lacking the
first and final motifs respectively. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 21 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
