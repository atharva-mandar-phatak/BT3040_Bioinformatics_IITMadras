8OXTPHPHTASE
The enzyme 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphatase (8-oxo-dGTPase)
is present in a variety of organisms, where it plays an important role in
the control of spontaneous mutagenesis [1]. The enzyme degrades 8-oxoguanine-
containing deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, a potentially mutagenic
substrate for DNA synthesis, to the corresponding monophosphate, thereby
preventing misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA [1]. 

8-oxo-dGTPase is an 18kDa protein containing 156 amino acid residues. The
amino acid sequence shares a degree of similarity with the MutT domain of 
the Escherichia coli MutT protein, which has a distinct 8-oxo-dGTPase 
activity [2]. When human cDNA is expressed in E.coli mutT- mutant cells,
there is a significant amount of 8-oxo-dGTPase activity and a reduced 
frequency of spontaneous mutation [2]. Human 8-oxo-dGTPase is thought to 
protect genetic information from the untoward effects of endogenous oxygen
radicals [2]. 

8OXTPHPHTASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatases. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the N- and C-terminal portions of the alignment - motifs 1
and 2 lie N-terminal to the MutT domain; and motifs 3-7 lie C-terminal to
it. A single iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
