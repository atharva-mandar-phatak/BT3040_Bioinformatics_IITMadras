CLENTEROTOXN
Clostridial species are one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastro-
intestinal illnesses. They are Gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur
naturally in the soil [1]. Among the family are: C.botulinum, which produces
one of the most potent toxins in existence; C.tetani, causative agent of
tetanus; and C.perfringens, commonly found in wound infections and diarrhoea
cases. The use of toxins to damage the host is a method deployed by many
bacterial pathogens.

The major virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens is the CPE enterotoxin,
which is secreted upon invasion of the host gut, and contributes to food 
poisoning and other gastrointestinal illnesses [1]. It has a molecular 
weight of 35.3kDa, and is responsible for the disintegration of tight 
junctions between endothelial cells in the gut [2]. This mechanism is 
mediated by host claudins-3 and -4, situated at the tight junctions [2]. 

Recently, two more host receptors have been characterised and expressed in 
vivo [3]. Named CPE-R and RVP1, these may be utilised in the passage of 
Clostridial species through the gut wall, although the regulatory mechanisms
have not been elucidated.

CLENTEROTOXN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
Clostridium enterotoxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length (~610 amino acids). Two iterations on
SPTR37_10f  were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set  
comprising 8 sequences was identified.
