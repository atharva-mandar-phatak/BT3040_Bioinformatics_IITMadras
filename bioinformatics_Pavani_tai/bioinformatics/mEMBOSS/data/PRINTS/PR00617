COPPERFIST
Copper levels are maintained in yeast by the copper-binding protein metallo-
thionein and a trans-activating regulatory protein that activates the
transcription of the metallothionein gene in response to copper [1,2]. This
regulatory protein binds specifically to the metallothionein promoter in
the presence, but not in the absence, of copper [1]. Deletion experiments 
have shown that the DNA-binding and metallo-regulatory functions of the 
factor is confined to the conserved N-terminal region, which forms a novel 
copper cluster, known as a copper fist [1,2]. This domain, which is similar
in structure to metallothionein itself, undergoes a large conformational 
change on copper-binding that allows DNA-binding [1].

COPPERFIST is a 3-element fingerprint the provides a signature for the 
copper-fist domain of a family of fungal transcription factors. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the
motifs were drawn from the full length of the domain, and include the 
region encoded by PROSITE pattern COPPER_FIST (PS01119). Two iterations
on OWL28.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 6 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences.
