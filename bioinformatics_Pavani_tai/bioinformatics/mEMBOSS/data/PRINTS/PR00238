OPSIN
Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that mediate vision [1,2].
They comprise an apoprotein (opsin), covalently linked to the chromophore
cis-retinal. Vision is effected through the absorption of a photon by the
chromophore, which is isomerised to the all-trans form, promoting a
conformational change in the protein.

Opsins are integral membrane proteins that belong to a superfamily of G-
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The activating ligands of the different
superfamily members vary widely in structure and character, yet the proteins
appear faithfully to have conserved a basic structural framework, believed
to consist of 7 transmembrane (TM) helices. Although the sequences of these
proteins are very diverse, reflecting to some extent this broad range of
activating ligands, nevertheless, motifs have been identified in the TM
regions that are characteristic of virtually the entire superfamily [3,4].
Amongst the exceptions are the olfactory receptors, which cluster together
in a subfamily, which lacks significant matches with domains 2, 4 and 6.
Interestingly, the opsins also seem to be emerging as increasingly atypical
of the superfamily, clustering most strongly, in phylogenetic analyses, with
the olfactory receptors [4]. 

OPSIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the opsin
family of GPCRs. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
13 sequences: the motifs encode regions generally well-conserved within the
opsins but less well-conserved in the superfamily - motif 1 spans the
first cytoplasmic loop; motif 2 lies in the second external loop; and
motif 3 spans part of the third external loop leading into TM domain 7.
Two iterations on OWL22.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 52 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 123 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
