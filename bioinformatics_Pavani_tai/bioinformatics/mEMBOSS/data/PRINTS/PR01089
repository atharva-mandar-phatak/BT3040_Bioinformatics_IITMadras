NEUREGULIN
Neuregulins are a sub-family of EGF-like molecules that have been shown to
play multiple essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including: cardiac
development, Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte differentiation, some aspects 
of neuronal development, as well as the formation of neuromuscular synapses
[1,2]. Included in the family are heregulin; neu differentiation factor;
acetylcholine receptor synthesis stimulator; glial growth factor; and
sensory and motor-neuron derived factor [3]. Multiple family members are
generated by alternate splicing or by use of several cell type-specific
transcription initiation sites. In general, they bind to and activate the
erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (erbB2 (HER2), erbB3 (HER3), and
erbB4 (HER4)), functioning both as heterodimers and homodimers.

NEUREGULIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
neuregulin family of cell adhesion molecules. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions within the central portion of the alignment, focusing on 
those sections that characterise the neuregulin family but distinguish them
from other EGF-like proteins - the motifs reside in the central hydrophilic
region, following the EGF-like structural unit and the most hydrophobic
segment. Two iterations on OWL31.1 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 19 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences.
