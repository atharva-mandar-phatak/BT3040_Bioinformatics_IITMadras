UBIQUITOUSSP
Moraxella catarrhalis is a Gram-positive coccoidal bacterium, morphologically
and biochemically related to the Neisseria [1]. It is usually found in the
commensal flora of both children and adults, and most commonly colonises the
mucous membranes of the nasopharyngeal tract [1]. However, M.catarrhalis can
also cause severe systemic infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis, otitis 
media and endocarditis. The microbe is fast becoming an important 
opportunisitic pathogen, and produces a number of virulent proteins on host 
invasion [1]. 

Two ubiquitously expressed proteins on the cell surface of M.catarrhalis 
have been shown to confer protection in a mouse model against the microbe; 
both resemble adhesins from other pathogenic bacteria [1,2]. Designated 
UspA1 and UspA2, they share significant amino acid sequence similarity and
are prime candidates for vaccine development owing to their immunogenic 
nature [2]. Clinical samples taken from patients has revealed little 
diversity in the genes; UspA1 appears to be the most promising target [3].

UBIQUITOUSSP is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Moraxella catarrhalis ubiquitous surface proteins. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iteration on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 14 sequences was identified.
