AMPBINDING
A number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes, which appear to act via an
ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate, share a region
of sequence similarity [1-3] - this region is a Ser/Thr/Gly-rich domain 
that is further characterised by a conserved Pro-Lys-Gly triplet. The 
family of enzymes includes luciferase, long chain fatty acid Co-A ligase, 
acetyl-CoA synthetase and various other closely related synthetases.

AMPBINDING is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
STG-rich domain of AMP-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs span the STG-rich domain,
motif 2 including the PKG triplet (cf. PROSITE pattern AMP_BINDING
(PS00455)). Two iterations on OWL11.0 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 13 sequences was identified, including
the ORA octapeptide-repeat antigen, and angR, a Vibrio anguillarum protein
believed to be a transcriptional activator [4]. On the basis of the
presence of this AMP-binding domain, however, together with other
indicators, it is thought that angR may be an enzyme involved in
anguibactin biosynthesis (see PROSITE pattern AMP_BINDING).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 157 sequences.
