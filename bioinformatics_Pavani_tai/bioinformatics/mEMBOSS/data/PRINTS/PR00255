NATPEPTIDER
Natriuretic peptides are hormones involved in the regulation of fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis; they stimulate intracellular production of the
second messenger cyclic GMP. Three peptide receptors are known, two of
which express quanylate cyclase activity, while the third is probably
responsible for the clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide from the
circulation and does not play a role in signal transduction [1,2]. The
receptors are plasma membrane-bound, and share the following topology:
an N-terminal extracellular domain, which is involved in ligand binding,
a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain.

NATPEPTIDER is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
natriuretic peptide receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 1 including the area
encoded by PROSITE pattern ANF_RECEPTORS (PS00458), which corresponds to
the ligand-binding region. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, which fails to make a
significant match with motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
