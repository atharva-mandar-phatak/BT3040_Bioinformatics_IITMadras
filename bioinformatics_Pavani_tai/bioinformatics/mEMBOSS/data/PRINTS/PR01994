ANTIREPRESSR
The antirepressor protein, ANT, prevents the prophage p22 c2 repressor
protein from binding to its operators; it also inhibits the action of other
prophage repressor proteins, including those of phages lambda and 434. The
synthesis of antirepressor is negatively regulated by the protein products
of the two other immi genes, mnt and arc.

ANTIREPRESSR is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
antirepressor protein ANT. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 32 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment. Three iterations on
SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 78 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also 
found, both of which are uncharacterised proteins that fail to make a 
signficant match with motif 1.
