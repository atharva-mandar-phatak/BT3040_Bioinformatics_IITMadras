GLHYDRLASE39
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 39 encompasses mammalian alpha-L-iduronidases and some
bacterial beta-xylosidases.

Alpha-L-iduronidase is a lysosomal enzyme, deficiency of which causes muco-
polysaccharidosis I (MPS I) [5]. The enzyme hydrolyses alpha-L-iduronosidic
linkages in desulphated dermatan.

GLHYDRLASE39 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 39 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the central portion of the alignment - motif 3 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F39 (PS01027), which
contains a Glu residue that may act as the proton donor in the catalytic
mechanism. A single iteration on OWL29.3 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 1
partial match.
