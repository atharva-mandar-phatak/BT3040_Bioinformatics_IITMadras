GLHYDRLASE36
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 36 encompasses alpha-galactosidases.

Alpha-galactosidase (melibiase) catalyses the hydrolysis of melibiose into
galactose and glucose [5]. In man, deficiency in the enzyme results in
Fabry's disease (X-linked sphingolipidosis). An E.coli plasmid-encoded
alpha-galactosidase (rafA) [6] contains a region of about 50 amino acids
that is similar to a domain of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases.

GLHYDRLASE36 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 36 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the central portion of the alignment - motif 4 includes the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern ALPHA_GALACTOSIDASE (PS00512), which
contains two conserved Asp residues that may be involved in the catalytic
mechanism. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified. A single 
partial match was found, TEMELA, an alpha-galactosidase that matches motifs
3 and 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
