LEPTIN
Leptin, a metabolic monitor of food intake and energy need, is expressed
by the ob obesity gene. The protein may function as part of a signalling
pathway from adipose tissue that acts to regulate the size of the body
fat depot [1], the hormone effectively turning the brain's appetite
message off when it senses that the body is satiated. Obese humans have
high levels of the protein, suggesting a similarity to type II (adult
onset) diabetes, in which sufferers over-produce insulin, but can't respond
to it metabolically - they have become insulin resistant. Similarly, it is
thought that obese individuals may be leptin resistant.

LEPTIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for obesity
factor proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from well-conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL27.0 was required to
reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
