7FE8SFRDOXIN
Ferredoxins [1] are iron-sulphur proteins that mediate electron transfer 
in a range of metabolic reactions. The proteins fall into several subgroups
according to the nature of their iron-sulphur cluster(s). The 7Fe
ferredoxins [2,3] contain both 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S centres, which are
spatially related according to the following scheme:

                   C  C     C E C
         H2N-------x--x-----x-x-x-----------\
                    \ \    / /  |           |            
                     [3Fe-4S]---' [4Fe-4S]--x C
                         |          / | \   |        
                HOOC-----x---------x--x--x--/
                         C         C  C  C
  
The 4Fe-4S domain is similar to those found in other bacterial-type
ferredoxins.

The 3D structure of the 7Fe ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii has been
determined to 1.9A resolution [3]. The fold belongs to the alpha + beta
class, with 3 helices and 4 strands forming a barrel-like structure, and
an extruded loop containing 3 of the 4 cysteinyl residues of the iron-
sulphur cluster.

7FE8SFRDOXIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 7Fe 
ferredoxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2 
sequences: motif 1 contains 2 of 3 invariant Cys residues contributing to
the 3Fe-4S cluster, which is located upstream from the 4Fe-4S domain;
motif 2 contains the first invariant Cys of the 4Fe-4S cluster; and motif 3
contains 3 invariant cysteines of the 4Fe-4S cluster and one Cys ligand of
its downstream 3Fe-4S counterpart (see scheme above). Two iterations on
OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 20 sequences was identified. 7 partial matches were also found,
all of them are proteins containing the 4Fe-4S cluster and matching motifs
2 and 3. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 17
partial matches.
