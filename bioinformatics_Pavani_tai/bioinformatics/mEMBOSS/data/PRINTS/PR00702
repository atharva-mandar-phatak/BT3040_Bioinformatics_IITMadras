ACRIFLAVINRP
The E.coli acrA and acrB genes encode a multi-drug efflux system that is
believed to protect the bacterium against hydrophobic inhibitors [1]. 
Sequence analysis of acrA reveals the presence of two open reading frames,
the second of which encodes a large transmembrane protein [2]. The protein
contains 12 hydrophobic, putative transmembrane domains. Proteins belonging
to this family include the P.aeruginosa multidrug resistance protein mexB, 
A.eutrophus cation efflux system protein czcA, and various R.meliloti
nodulation proteins.

ACRIFLAVINRP is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
members of the acriflavin resistance protein family. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were largely
drawn from conserved hydrophobic regions and span virtually the full
alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 lie in the N-terminal portion of the
alignment, and motifs 3-9 in the C-terminal portion. Two iterations on
OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 16 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also
found, all of which are acriflavin resistance protein homologues.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 20 sequences, and 20
partial matches.
