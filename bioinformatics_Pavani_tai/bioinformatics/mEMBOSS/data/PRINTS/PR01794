VDCCGAMMA6
Voltage-dependent calcium channels are a diverse family of proteins that 
encompass a variety of biological functions, including presynaptic
neurotransmitter release and protein signalling within the cell [1,2]. The
high voltage-activated (L-, N-, P-, Q- and R-type) channels comprise the 
alpha-1 subunit, which creates the pore for the import of extracellular 
calcium ions [2]. The activity of this pore is modulated by 4 tightly-
coupled subunits: an intracellular beta subunit; a transmembrane (TM) gamma 
subunit; and a disulphide-linked complex of alpha-2 and delta subunits, 
which are proteolytically cleaved from the same gene product [3,4].

The voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma (VDCCG) subunit family consists 
of at least 8 members, which share a number of common structural features 
[5]. Each member is predicted to possess 4 TM domains, with intracellular
N- and C-termini. The first extracellular loop contains a highly conserved
N-glycosylation site and a pair of conserved cysteine residues. The 
C-terminal 7 residues of VDCCG-2, -3, -4 and -8 are also conserved and 
contain a consensus site for phosphorylation by cAMP and cGMP-dependent
protein kinases, and a target site for binding by PDZ domain proteins [5].

The VDCCG-6 subunit was identified by high throughput genomic sequence 
database searching, pursuing sequences similar to VDCCG-1 to -5 [5].
Mouse, human and rat isoforms have been cloned. VDCCG-6 is expressed in a 
range of tissues including brain, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, prostate 
and testis [5].

VDCCGAMMA6 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-6 subunit proteins. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length,
focusing on those sections that characterise the VDCCG-6 subunits but 
distinguish them from other family members - motifs 1 and 2 lie in the 
cytoplasmic N-terminal region; motifs 3 and 4 reside in the first
extracellular loop; and motif 5 spans part of TM domain 4 and part of the 
intracellular C-terminal region. A single iteration on SPTR40_20f was 
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond 
the starting set.
