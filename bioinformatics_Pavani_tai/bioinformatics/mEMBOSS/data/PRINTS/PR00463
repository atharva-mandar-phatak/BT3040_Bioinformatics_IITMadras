EP450I
P450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins [1],
widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. The enzymes
are involved in metabolism of a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous
compounds [2]. Usually, they act as terminal oxidases in multi-component
electron transfer chains, called P450-containing monooxygenase systems.

Current P450 nomenclature, based on divergent evolution of the P450
superfamily, was proposed and developed by Nebert et al. [3]. On the basis
of sequence similarity, all P450s can be categorised into 2 main classes,
the so-called B- and E-classes: P450 proteins of prokaryotic 3-component
systems and fungal P450nor (CYP55) belong to the B-class; all other known
P450s from distinct systems are of the E-class [4]. E-class P450s may be
further divided into 5 subclasses (groups) according to protein sequence
similarities. The data suggest that divergence of the P450 superfamily 
into B- and E-classes, and further divergence into stable P450 groups 
within the E-class, must be very ancient and had occured before the 
appearance of eukaryotes. 

Group I is richest in members, consisting of P450 families CYP1, CYP2,
CYP17, CYP21 and CYP71 [4]. The members of the first 4 families are of
vertebrate origin, while those from CYP71 derive from plants. CYP1 and CYP2
enzymes mainly metabolise exogenous substrates, whereas CYP17 and CYP21 are
involved in metabolism of endogenous physiologically-active compounds.

EP450I is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for group I
E-class P450s. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 19
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Since no 3D structure is available for a group I
E-class P450 representative, the assignment of secondary structure elements
given below has been adopted from the modelling study of Szklarz et al. [5].
Motifs 1 and 2 span the first beta-strand and helix B; motif 3 includes
helix E; motif 4 corresponds to the N-terminus of helix I, which is thought
to be central to the catalytic function of P450s; motif 5 spans the helix I
C-terminus and the neighbouring J helix (cf. motifs 1 and 2 of signature
P450); motif 6 corresponds to helix K (cf. motif 3 of signature P450);
motif 7 spans the K' helix N-terminus and the "aromatic region" typical of
E-class P450s [4]; and motifs 8 and 9 are adjacent, spanning the L helix and
including the invariant Cys residue that provides the haem iron thiolate
ligand (cf. PROSITE pattern CYTOCHROME_P450 (PS00086) and motifs 4 and 5 of
signature P450). Three iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 194 sequences was
identified. In addition to the aforementioned families, several C.elegans 
sequences comprising subfamilies CYP14A (CEK09A111, CEK09A112, CEK09A113),
CYP22A (CELT13C53) and CYP23A (CELB0304) were found to match all 9 motifs.
Numerous partial matches were also found. Those matching 8 motifs should
also be classified as group I E-class P450s: CYP2E1 (CPE1_MACFA), CYP71A
(C712_SOLME, S45039) and CYP71B (THLCYP450A) fail to make a significant
match with motif 2; CYP71A (C771_SOLME, C772_SOLME), CYP71C4 (ZMCYP71C4),
CYP75 (CP75_SOLME, S33515, S33521), CYP76A1 (C761_SOLME) and CYP13A
(CEZK13203) lack motif 3; CYP73A (TCMO_MEDSA, TCMO_HELTU, S44169, ZEU19922,
PSU29243, PUMC4H) lack motif 4; and CYP1A2 (S16875) and CYP71A4 (C714_SOLME)
lack motif 5. The sequences matching 7 motifs include both group I E-class 
P450s and other E-class P450s. Most of the sequences matching only 2 motifs
are noise.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 242 sequences, and 486
partial matches.
