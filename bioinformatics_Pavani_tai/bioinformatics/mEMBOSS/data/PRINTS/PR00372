FYWHYDRXLASE
Phenylalanine- , tyrosine- and tryptophan hydroxylases constitute a family
of tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, all of
which are rate-limiting catalysts for important metabolic pathways [1]. The
proteins are structurally and functionally related, each containing iron,
and catalysing ring hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids, using tetra-
hydrobiopterin (BH4) as a substrate. All are regulated by phosphorylation
at serines in their N-termini.

It has been suggested that the proteins each contain a conserved C-terminal
catalytic (C) domain and an unrelated N-terminal regulatory (R) domain.
It is possible that the R domains arose from genes that were recruited
from different sources to combine with the common gene for the catalytic
core. Thus, by combining with the same C domain, the proteins acquired
the unique regulatory properties of the separate R domains.   

FYWHYDRXLASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length (the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern BIOPTERIN_HYDROXYL (PS00367), which contains 2 conserved
histidines, lies between motifs 2 and 3). Two iterations on OWL26.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 21
sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 23 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
