SFASSEMBLIN
Striated fibre assemblin (SFA), an acidic 33kDa protein, is the major 
component of striated microtubule-associated fibres (SMAFs) in the flagellar
basal apparatus of green flagellates. In Chlamydomonas, and other green
flagellates, the SMAFs form a cross-like pattern and run alongside the
proximal parts of four bundles of flagellar root microtubules.

The sequence of SFA contains two structurally distinct domains [1]. The
head domain, with ~30 residues, contains all the prolines (3-8 depending on
species) and is rich in hydroxyamino acids. This non-helical domain is
further characterised by the presence of repetitive SP-motifs, some of them
in the context SP(M/T)R, which is a putative substrate for p34-CDC2 kinase
[2]. The rod domain, with ~250 residues, is predicted to be mostly alpha-
helical (the alpha-helix content was estimated to be 76% for the entire
molecule or 85% for the postulated rod domain [1]). This domain shows a 
pronounced coiled-coil-forming ability and contains a 29-residue repeat
pattern based on four heptads, followed by a skip residue [1].

SFASSEMBLIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
SF-assemblins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full length of the rod domain - motif 4 includes the putative coiled-
coil domain. A single iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
