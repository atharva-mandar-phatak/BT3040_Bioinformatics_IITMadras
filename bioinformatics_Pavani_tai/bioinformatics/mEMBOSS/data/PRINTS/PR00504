CHROMODOMAIN
The CHROMO (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) domain [1-4] is a conserved
region of around 60 amino acids, originally identified in Drosophila
modifiers of variegation - these are proteins that alter the structure of
chromatin to the condensed morphology of heterochromatin, a cytologically
visible condition where gene expression is repressed. In one of these
proteins, Polycomb, the chromo domain has been shown to be important for
chromatin targeting. Proteins that contain a chromo domain appear to fall
into 3 classes: (1) those having an N-terminal chromo domain followed by a
region termed the chromo shadow domain [3]; (2) those with a single chromo
domain; and (3) those with paired tandem chromo domains. 

CHROMODOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
chromo domain. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the
full domain length, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern CHROMO_1 (PS00598). Two iterations on OWL27.1 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 12 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
believed to be family members. This is not a powerful discriminator owing
to the low level of sequence similarity between different chromo domains.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 30 sequences, and 21
partial matches.
