LEUILEVALBP
Leu/Ile/Val/Thr- and Leu-binding proteins, which share a high degree of
sequence similarity, are components of the leucine-specific transport
system: this is one of two periplasmic binding protein-dependent systems
in the high-affinity transport of branched-chain amino acids in bacteria
[1,2]. A much weaker sequence relationship has been reported between the
periplasmic binding proteins and the aliphatic amidase expression-
regulating protein, AmiC [3]. On this basis, it has been suggested that
AmiC may be capable of adopting a similar 3D fold [3]. 

LEUILEVALBP is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Leu/Ile/Val/Thr- and Leu-binding proteins. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions along the full alignment length, 1-2 and 4-6 encompassing
alpha helical domains, and 3 and 7 spanning beta strand regions. Two
iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 9 sequences was identified. A single partial match
was also found: this is AmiC, which matches motifs 2, 4 and 6.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
