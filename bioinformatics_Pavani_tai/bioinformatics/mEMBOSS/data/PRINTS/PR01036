TCRTETB
The streptococcal plasmid pMV158 and its derivative pLS1 are able to 
confer tetracycline resistance in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria [1]. Determination of the complete DNA sequence of pLS1 revealed 
four open reading frames (ORFs) [1]; one putative mRNA transcript encoded a 
very hydrophobic protein required for tetracycline resistance (Tcr). The tet
gene of pLS1 is similar to tet genes in two other plasmids of Gram-positive
origin, but different in both sequence and mode of regulation from tet genes
of Gram-negative origin [1]. 

Similarly, the nucleotide sequence of the Tcr region of Bacillus plasmid
pTHT15 has been determined, and a single ORF encoding a 458 amino acid 
50kDa protein (Tet) identified after a GTG initiation codon preceded 
by a ribosome binding site [2]. Comparison of the Tet protein with the
staphylococcal Tcr proteins of pT181 revealed considerable similarity. 

The Tet protein confers resistance to tetracycline by active tetracycline
efflux, by functioning as a metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter. This is an
energy-dependent process that decreases the accumulation of the antibiotic
in whole cells. Tet is an integral membrane protein with 12 potential
transmembrane domains.

TCRTETB is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for TetB
tetracycline resistance proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1-11 encode putative 
TM domains 1-11; and motif 12 lies at the C-terminus. A single iteration
on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being 
identified beyond the starting set. Several partial matches were found, 
all of which are fragments and related Tcr proteins that fail to match 5 
or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
