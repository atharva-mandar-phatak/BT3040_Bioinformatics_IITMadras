ADENOVSFIBRE
Adenoviruses are responsible for diseases such as pneumonia, cystitis,
conjunctivitis and diarrhoea, all of which can be fatal to patients who
are immunocompromised [1]. Viral infection commences with recognition
of host cell receptors by means of specialised proteins on viral surfaces. 
The adenovirus fibre protein 'knob domain' is one such receptor-binding
protein subunit.

The crystal structure of the knob domain reveals a trimeric organisation,
each subdomain folded into 2 functionally-distinct beta-sheets: the V sheet
is highly conserved, and provides contact surfaces in the formation of the
trimer; the R sheet is more variable, and may play a role in viral-receptor
interactions. The overall shape of the trimer resembles a 3-bladed 
propeller, with a central surface depression and 3 valleys formed by the
symmetry-related R sheets. Sequence comparison of different types of 
adenovirus fibre protein suggests an overall similarity in the structure
of the knob domain. The main conserved regions lie in the central surface
depression around the 3-fold symmetry axis [1].

ADENOVSFIBRE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
adenovirus fibre proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL25.2
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
21 sequences was identified. Four partial matches were also found, all of
which are adenovirus fibre proteins that fail to make significant matches
with one or more of the motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 35 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
