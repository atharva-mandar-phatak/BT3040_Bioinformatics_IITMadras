BLEOMYCINRST
Bleomycin (Blm) is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced naturally by 
actinomycetes. It is a strong DNA-cutting agent and thus finds use as 
a potent anti-cancer drug [1]. The DNA-cutting mechanism is complex, 
involving concomitant oxidation of FeII and reduction of oxygen. In
addition to iron, Blm binds other transition metals: cobalt, nickel, 
copper and zinc. Actinomycetes have developed a defence mechanism 
against this lethal compound, producing a protein that confers 
resistance to Blm through drug sequestering.

The crystal structure of the bleomycin resistance protein reveals 2
identically-folded halves, each having an alpha/beta fold but showing no
sequence similarity [2]. Each half comprises a 4-stranded beta-sheet and
a short alpha-helix (3 turns). The sheets within each half lie roughly at
right-angles and are related by an approximate 2-fold axis. The crystal
packing shows compact dimers that have a hydrophobic interface and are
involved in mutual chain exchange. 

BLEOMYCINRST is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bleomycin resistance proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions in the first of the alpha/beta folds. Two iterations on OWL25.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
7 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
