DELTATUBULIN
Microtubules are polymers of tubulin, a dimer of two 55kDa subunits, 
designated alpha and beta [1,2]. Within the microtubule lattice, alpha-beta
heterodimers associate in a head-to-tail fashion, giving rise to microtubule 
polarity. Fluorescent labelling studies have suggested that tubulin is
oriented in microtubules with beta-tubulin toward the plus end [3]. 

For maximal rate and extent of polymerisation into microtubules, tubulin 
requires GTP. Two molecules of GTP are bound at different sites, termed N 
and E. At the E (Exchangeable) site, GTP is hydrolysed during incorporation
into the microtubule. Close to the E site is an invariant region rich in 
glycine residues, which is found in both chains and is thought to control
access of the nucleotide to its binding site [4]. 

Most species, excepting simple eukaryotes, express a variety of closely-
related alpha- and beta-isotypes. A third family member, gamma-tubulin, has
also been identified in a number of species. Gamma-tubulin is found at 
microtubule-organising centres, such as the spindle poles or the centrosome, 
suggesting that it is involved in minus-end nucleation of microtubule 
assembly [5]. More recently, a new delta-type tubulin has been identified
in Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii [6] and mouse [7], and is likely to be found
in a number of other species.

DELTATUBULIN is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
delta-tubulins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 
2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise the 
delta-tubulins but distinguish them from the rest of the tubulin family.
A single iteration on SWALL19991110 was required to reach convergence, no 
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several partial 
matches were also found, all of which are gamma- or alpha-tubulins that
match two motifs.
