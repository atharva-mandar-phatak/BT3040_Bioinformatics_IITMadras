FUNGALZNCYS
The N-terminal region of a number of fungal transcriptional regulatory 
proteins contains a Cys-rich motif that is involved in zinc-dependent
binding of DNA. The region forms a binuclear Zn cluster, in which 2 Zn 
atoms are bound by 6 Cys residues [1,2]. The range of proteins known to 
contain such a domain include those involved in arginine, proline, 
pyrimidine, quinate, maltose and galactose metabolism; amide and GABA
catabolism; leucine biosynthesis; and so on.

FUNGALZNCYS is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
Zn-Cys binuclear cluster. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs span the Cys-rich region encoded
by PROSITE pattern ZN2_CY6_FUNGAL (PS00463). Two iterations on OWL17.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 17 
sequences was identified. Six partial matches were also found: closer 
inspection reveals that these are all true family members, but the poor 
conservation in the third and particularly the fourth motifs means that 
these are not matched as well as the first 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 31 sequences, and 41
partial matches.
