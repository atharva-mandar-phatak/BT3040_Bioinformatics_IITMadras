NEUROPHYSIN
Oxytocin and vasopressin are nine-residue, structurally and functionally
related neurohypophysial peptide hormones [1]. Oxytocin mediates contraction
of the smooth muscle of the uterus and mammary gland, while vasopressin has an
an antidiuretic action on the kidney, and mediates vasoconstriction of the 
peripheral vessels [1]. In common with most active peptides, both hormones 
are synthesised as larger protein precursors that are enzymatically
converted to their mature forms. Members of this family are found in birds,
fish, reptiles and amphibians (mesotocin, isotocin, valitocin, glumitocin,
aspargtocin, vasotocin, seritocin, asvatocin, phasvatocin), in worms
(annetocin), octopi (cephalotocin), locust (locupressin or neuropeptide
F1/F2) and in molluscs (conopressins G and S) [2].

NEUROPHYSIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
neurohypophysial hormones. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 includes
the oxytocin peptide; and motifs 2-5 span the neurophysin polypeptide.
Two iterations on OWL29.6 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 35 sequences was identified. Several partial
matches were also found, all of which are family members, most being
fragments that do not include the oxytocin peptide.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 35 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
