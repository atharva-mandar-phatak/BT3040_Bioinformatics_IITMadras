TAFAZZIN
Tafazzins [1] are expressed in high levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle. 
As many as 10 isoforms can be present in different amounts in different
tissues. Isoforms with hydrophobic N-termini are thought to be membrane
anchored, while shorter forms, lacking the hydrophobic stretch, may be
cytoplasmic (these latter are found in leukocytes and fibroblasts, but not
in heart and skeletal muscle). A central hydrophilic domain may serve as
an exposed loop that interacts with other proteins.

Defects in taz are the cause of Barth syndrome, a severe inherited disorder,
often fatal in childhood [1]. The disease is characterised by cardiac and
skeletal myopathy, short stature and neutropenia [1].

TAFAZZIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
tafazzins. The fingerprint was derived from an intitial alignment of 3
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the central portion of the alignment - motif 4 lies in the hydrophilic
domain. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
