RCCNDNSATION
RCC1, the regulator of chromosome condensation, is a eukaryotic protein
that binds to chromatin. It interacts with the nuclear GTP-binding protein, 
ran, to promote loss of bound GDP and uptake of fresh GTP, thereby behaving 
as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator [1,2]. The interaction of
RCC1 with ran is thought to play an key role in the regulation of gene 
expression. The sequence of RCC1 contains 7 tandem repeats of a 50-60 amino 
acid domain, the repeats constituting the major part of the protein. 

RCCNDNSATION is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
RCC1 family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 6 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the 
central tandem repeat region - motif 3 encompasses the area encoded by 
PROSITE pattern RCC1_1 (PS00625), which is found in the N-terminal portion 
of the second repeat; motif 5 includes the region encoded by PROSITE 
pattern RCC1_2 (PS00626), which lies in the C-terminal portion of each 
repeat. A single iteration on OWL28.3 was required to reach convergence, 
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several 
partial matches were also found, all of which are either fragments or 
close relatives of the RCC1 family.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences, and 17
partial matches.
