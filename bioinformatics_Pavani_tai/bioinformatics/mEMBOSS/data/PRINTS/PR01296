CLOACNIMMNTY
The cloacin immunity protein complexes with cloacin in equimolar quantities
and inhibits it by binding with high affinity to the cloacin C-terminal
catalytic domain. The immunity protein is relatively small, containing 85
amino acids. 

An extra ribosome binding site has been found to precede the immunity gene
on the polycistronic Clo DF13 mRNA [1], which perhaps accounts for the fact
that, in cloacinogenic cells, more immunity protein than cloacin is 
synthesised [1]. Comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of the Clo
DF13 immunity protein with that of the Col E3 and Col E6 immunity proteins
reveals extensive similarities in primary structure, although Col E3 and 
Clo DF13 immunity proteins are exchangeable only to a low extent in vivo
and in vitro [1]. 

CLOACNIMMNTY is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
cloacin immunity proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 4
sequences was identified.
