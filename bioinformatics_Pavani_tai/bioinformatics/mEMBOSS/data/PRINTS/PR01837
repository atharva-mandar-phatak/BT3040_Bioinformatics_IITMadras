MGTCSAPBPROT
The MgtC protein is encoded by the mgtCB operon, which also encodes the
P-type Mg2+-transporter, MgtB [1]. MgtC is a small hydrophobic protein
with 5-6 putative transmembrane segments based on hydropathy analysis [2].
The function of MgtC is unknown; however, it is essential for virulence of
Salmonella typhimurium and does not appear to be a Mg2+ transporter [1].
It has been speculated that it may be involved in membrane recognition or
that it might be exported from the bacterium to the eukaryotic cell
membrane, possibly acting as some kind of channel [2]. The MgtC domain-
containing Bacillus subtilis SapB protein is also included in this family.

MGTCSAPBPROT is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
MgtC/SapB proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 30 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, Q8YRP8 and Q9HPQ3, members
of the MgtC/SapB family that failed to match one or more motifs.
