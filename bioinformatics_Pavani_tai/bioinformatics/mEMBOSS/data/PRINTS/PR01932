INTRLEUKIN17
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine produced by 
activated memory T cells [1]. The IL-17 family (of which there are 6 known 
members, termed IL-17A to IL-17F) is thought to represent a distinct 
signalling system that appears to have been highly conserved across 
vertebrate evolution [1]. Family members play an active role in 
inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer [2]. 

INTRLEUKIN17 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-17. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 8
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Four iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 38 sequences was 
identified. Three partial matches were also found: A8JYG6_CHICK and
Q6L5M6_CIOIN are translated chicken and sea squirt mRNAs, respectively,
that fail to match motif 1; and Q6L5M4_CIOIN is a translated sea squirt
mRNA that fails to match motif 3.
