BPEROXIDASE
Peroxidases are haem-containing enzymes that use hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions.
Most haem peroxidases follow the reaction scheme:

Fe(3+) + H2O2            --> [Fe(4+)=O]R' (Compound I) + H2O
[Fe(4+)=O]R' + substrate --> [Fe(4+)=O]R (Compound II) + oxidised substrate
[Fe(4+)=O]R  + substrate -->  Fe(3+) + H2O + oxidised substrate

In this mechanism, the enzyme reacts with one equivalent of H2O2 to give 
[Fe(4+)=O]R' (compound I). This is a two-electron oxidation/reduction 
reaction where H2O2 is reduced to water and the enzyme is oxidised. One 
oxidising equivalent resides on iron, giving the oxyferryl [Fe(4+)=O] 
intermediate, while in many peroxidases the porphyrin (R) is oxidised to 
the porphyrin pi-cation radical (R'). Compound I then oxidises an organic 
substrate to give a substrate radical [1].

Peroxidases are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. In certain
bacterial species, haemoproteins of 575-745 residues have been found that
exhibit both peroxidase and catalase (2 H2O2 --> O2 + 2 H2O) activities.
It is thought that catalase-peroxidase provides protection to cells under
oxidative stress [2].

Bacterial catalase-peroxidases are approximately twice the size of plant 
and fungal haem peroxidases. Sequence analysis suggests that this doubling
in length can be ascribed to gene duplication, whereby each half is similar
to monomeric plant or fungal peroxidases. However, the C-terminal half does
not bind haem, so the bacterial enzymes have a single haem per subunit [3].

BPEROXIDASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bacterial catalase-peroxidases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: motif 9 comtains the invariant "proximal" His, 
which serves the axial ligand of the haem iron. Five iterations on 
SPTR57_40f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 692 sequences was identified. Thirty six partial matches were 
also found, all of which are family members that fail to make signficant 
matches with one or more motifs.
