GLHYDRLASE6
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt). Family 6 includes endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases,
which are essential enzymes for microbial degradation of cellulose and
xylans. 

The 3D structure of the enzymatic core of cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) from
the fungus Trichoderma reesei reveals an alpha-beta protein with a fold
similar to the ubiquitous barrel topology first seen in triose phosphate
isomerase [5]. The active site of CBHII is located at the C-terminal end of
a parallel beta barrel, in an enclosed tunnel through which the cellulose
threads. Two aspartic acid residues, located in the center of the tunnel
are the probable catalytic residues [5].

GLHYDRLASE6 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
family 6 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
within the catalytic domain - motif 2 includes part of the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern GLYCOSYL_HYDROL_F6_1 (PS00655), which contains a
conserved aspartic acid residue that may be involved in the catalytic
mechanism [5]. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 16 sequences was identified. Several
partial matches were also found, all of which are family members that fail
to make significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 1
partial match.
