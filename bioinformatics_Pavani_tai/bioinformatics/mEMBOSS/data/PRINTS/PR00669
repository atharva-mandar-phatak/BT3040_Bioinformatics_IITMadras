INHIBINA
Inhibin is a gonadal glycopeptide that preferentially suppresses pituitary
secretion of follitropin (follicle-stimulating hormone) [1]. It is a
heterodimeric protein, linked by one or more disulphide bonds: inhibin A is
a dimer of alpha and beta-A chains; and inhibin B is a dimer of alpha and
beta-B. Inhibins belong to a gene family that also includes transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [2].

INHIBINA is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for inhibin
alpha subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the C-terminal two-thirds of the
alignment, motifs 2,3 and 5-8 each containing conserved Cys residues, which
are involved in inter- and intra-chain disulphide bond formation. A single
iteration on OWL29.1 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set. Numerous partial matches were
found: all are members of the TGF-beta family that match motifs 5 and 6,
which contain 2 of the conserved cysteines (cf. PROSITE pattern TGF_BETA
(PS00250)).

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences.
