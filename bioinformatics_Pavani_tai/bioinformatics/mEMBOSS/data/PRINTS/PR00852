XRODRMPGMNTD
Defects in DNA repair proteins can give rise, in humans, to the autosomal
recessive disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne's syndrome [1,2].
XP is characterised by a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer,
the effect of skin-cell hypersensitivity to UV resulting from defects in
the nucleotide excision pathway. Seven XP complementation groups have
been identified: XP-A to XP-G. 

The XP group D gene product (XPD) is a helicase that is required for
nucleotide excision repair, and is also one of the components of basal
transcription factor TFIIH [3,4]. DNA repair defects in the XPD group are
associated with the clinical features of XP and trichothiodystrophy (TTD),
which is characterised by sulphur-deficient brittle hair and a variety of
other associated abnormalities, but no skin cancer [4]. 

XPD belongs to a family of ATP-dependent helicases that are characterised
by a 'D-E-A-H' motif [5]. This resembles the 'D-E-A-D-box' of other known
helicases, which represents a special version of the B motif of ATP-binding
proteins. In XPD, His replaces the second Asp. 

XRODRMPGMNTD is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
xeroderma pigmentosum group D complementation proteins. The fingerprint 
was derived from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were 
drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length. A single
iteration on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence, no further sequences
being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences.
