ARATH130DUF
A total of 715 potential protein-coding genes have been identified in the 
nucleotide sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5, with an average
gene density of 1 gene per 4001 bp [1]. Amongst the gene products is a 
well-conserved family of 130.7kDa proteins that share no sequence similarity
with any other known proteins. The sequences are characterised by an 
N-terminal domain of variable length, a central cysteine-rich region and a
relatively acidic C-terminal domain. The sequences may possess a PHD finger.

ARATH130DUF is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
family of Arabidopsis 130.7kDa hypothetical proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - 
motifs 1-3 span the N-terminal domain; motifs 4 and 5 reside in the central
cysteine-rich region; and motifs 6-9 reside in the C-terminal domain. A 
single iteration on SPTR39_15f was required to reach convergence, no 
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
