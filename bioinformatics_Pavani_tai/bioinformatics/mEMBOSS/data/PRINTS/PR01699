ORGNOHGLYASE
Mercury is a highly toxic metal. Toxicity can result from three different
mercurial forms: elemental, inorganic ion and organomercurial compounds. The
ability of bacteria to detoxify mercurial compounds by reduction and
volatilisation is conferred by the Mer genes, which are usually plasmid
encoded (although chromosome resistance determinants have also occasionally
been identified) [1,3,4,5]. Organomercurial lyase (MerB) mediates the first
of the two steps in the microbial detoxification of organomercurial salts
(the other catalysed by mercuric reductase). 

Organomercurial lyase catalyses the protonolysis of the C-Hg bond in a wide
range of organomercurial salts (primary, secondary, tertiary, alkyl, vinyl,
allyl and aryl) to Hg(II) and the respective organic compound [2]:

			RHg(+) + H(+) = RH + Hg(2+)

Hg(II) is subsequently detoxified by mercuric reductase. 

The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity in E.coli and has been found
to be a 22.4kDa monomer with no detectable cofactors or metal ions [2].

ORGNOHGLYASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
organomercurial lyases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR40_18f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 13
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, Q9S4I3,
an organomercurial lyase from E.coli that fails to make a significant match
with motif 5.
