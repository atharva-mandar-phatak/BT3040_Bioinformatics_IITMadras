FLGHOOKFLIK
During flagellar morphogenesis in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia
coli, the fliK gene product is responsible for hook length control [1].
The deduced amino acid sequences of FliK proteins from S.typhimurium and
E.coli have molecular masses of 41,748 and 39,246 Da, respectively, and
are fairly hydrophilic [1]. Sequence comparison reveals around 50% identity,
with greatest conservation in the C-terminal region, with 71% identity in 
the last 154 amino acids - mutagenesis of this conserved region completely
abolishes motility. The central and C-terminal regions are rich in proline
and glutamine respectively; it is thought that they may constitute
distinct domains, separated by a linker region [1].

It is considered unlikely that FliK functions as a molecular ruler for
determining hook length, but that it is more likely to be employing a novel
mechanism [1]. 

FLGHOOKFLIK is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for FliK
flagellar hook-length control proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration on OWL30.2 
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
