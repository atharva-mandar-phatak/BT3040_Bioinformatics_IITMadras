SIGMA70FCT
RNA polymerase holoenzymes of bacteria contain the major sigma factors that
play a central role in the initiation of transcription [1]. These sigma 
factors are important both in selective binding of RNA polymerase to 
promoters, and in the efficient initiation of transcription [2]: the 
sigma factor interacts with several subunits of the core polymerase, with 
DNA in the promoter region, with short nascent RNA, and perhaps weakly with
rifampicin bound to the core polymerase beta subunit [2]. The major factor 
can also be substituted with other factors in specialised conditions, such 
as heat shock, to allow the activation of transcription of genes required 
in these situations.

Most bacteria express a multiplicity of sigma factors. Two of these,
sigma-70 (generally known as the major or primary sigma factor) and 
sigma-54, direct the transcription of a wide variety of genes: the others
(known as alternative sigma factors) are required for the transcription of 
specific subsets of genes. 

SIGMA70FCT is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
sigma-70 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 10 sequences: motif 1 spans a conserved region whose exact function is
unknown, but which may be involved in binding of the sigma factor to the
core RNA polymerase (cf. PROSITE pattern SIGMA70_1 (PS00715)); motifs 4
and 5 encompass a conserved region that appears to harbour a DNA-binding
helix-turn-helix motif, which is involved in binding the conserved region
of promoters recognised by the major sigma factors (cf. PROSITE pattern
SIGMA70_2 (PS00716)). Five iterations on OWL20.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 46 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 155 sequences, and 51
partial matches.
