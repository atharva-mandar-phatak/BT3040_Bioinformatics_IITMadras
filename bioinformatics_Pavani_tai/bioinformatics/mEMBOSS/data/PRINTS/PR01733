LIPPROTEIN48
Mycoplasma species are unique amongst bacteria in having very small genomes
and lacking cell walls, and are wholly dependent on their host for survival,
be it in a symbiotic or pathogenic lifestyle [1]. Some virulent species can
quickly adapt to new environments, and utilise a number of cell surface
moieties to attach to target cells. Although the most common form of
Mycoplasma pathogenesis is respiratory infection, some strains have also
been implicated in bacterial vaginosis and rheumatoid arthritis [1].

An outer membrane lipoprotein, designated P48 on account of its 48kDa 
molecular weight, was purified from Mycoplasma fermetans [2]. It was found
to be a potent differentiation/activation factor of human monocytes, and 
possesses both immunomodulatory and haematopoietic differentiation 
activities [2,3]. This is believed to aid the bacterium by recruiting human
blood cells to the point of infection, and altering them to allow 
intracellular invasion by Mycoplasma [3]. Similar species also use the
P48 lipoprotein to invade host cells of sheep and cattle, causing contagious 
agalactia [3].

Recently, recombinant studies on the M.agalactiae P48 major surface protein
have shown that changing key elements at the genetic level decreases the 
immunomodulatory effects of the gene product [4]. This may lead to a novel 
vaccine for Mycoplasma infections.

LIPPROTEIN48 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Mycoplasma P48 major surface lipoprotein family. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning the C-terminal portion of the alignment.
Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified. A single partial 
match was also found, Q48902, a related Mycoplasma surface lipoprotein that
matches motifs 4 and 5.
