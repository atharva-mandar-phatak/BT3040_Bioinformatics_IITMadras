LIGHTHARVSTB
The antenna complexes of photosynthetic bacteria function as light-
harvesting systems that absorb light and transfer the excitation energy
to the reaction centers. The antenna complexes usually comprise 2
polypeptides (alpha- and beta-chains), 2-3 bacteriochlorophyll molecules
and some carotenoids [1,2].

The alpha- and beta-chains are small proteins of 40-70 residues. Each has 
an N-terminal hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane (TM)
region, and a small C-terminal hydrophilic periplasmic domain. In both
chains, the TM domain houses a conserved His residue, presumed to be
involved in binding the magnesium atom of a bacteriochlorophyll group.
The beta-chains are characterised by a further histidine at the C-terminal
extremity of the cytoplasmic domain, which is also thought to be involved
in bacteriochlorophyll binding.

LIGHTHARVSTB is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
light harvesting protein B chains. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 15 sequences: the motifs span the full alignment
length - motif 1 was drawn from the cytoplasmic domain and includes the
first conserved His; and motif 2 spans the TM domain and includes the
second His (cf. PROSITE pattern ANTENNA_COMP_BETA (PS00969)). Two iterations
on OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 35 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 36 sequences.
