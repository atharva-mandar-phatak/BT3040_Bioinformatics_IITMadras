TFIID30KDSUB
Transcription initiation factor TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that
plays a central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators
and repressors. The complex includes TATA binding protein (TBP) and various
TBP-associated factors (TAFS). TFIID a bona fide RNA polymerase II-specific
TATA-binding protein-associated factor (TAF) and is essential for viability
[1]. 

TFIID acts to nucleate the transcription complex, recruiting the rest of
the factors through a direct interaction with TFIIB. The TBP subunit of
TFIID is sufficient for TATA-element binding and TFIIB interaction, and 
can support basal transcription. The protein belongs to the TAF2H family. 

TFIID30KDSUB is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for  
transcription initiation factor TFIID 23-30kDa subunits. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified.
