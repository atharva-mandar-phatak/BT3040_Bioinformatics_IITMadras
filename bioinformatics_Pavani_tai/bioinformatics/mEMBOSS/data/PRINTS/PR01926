INTERLEUKIN9
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is expressed primarily by activated T cells [1]. The 
growth factor and anti-apoptotic activities of IL-9 on multiple transformed
cells suggest a potential role for the cytokine in tumourigenesis [2]. IL-9
has also been proposed as a candidate gene for asthma [3].

INTERLEUKIN9 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-9. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
C-terminal two thirds of the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 
sequences was identified.
