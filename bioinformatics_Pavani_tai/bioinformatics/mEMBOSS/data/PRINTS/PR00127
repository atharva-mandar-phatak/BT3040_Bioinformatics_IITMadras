CLPPROTEASEP
The clp protease is an ATP-dependent protease that cleaves a number of 
proteins, such as casein and albumin [1]. It exists as a heterodimer of
ATP-binding regulatory A and catalytic P subunits, both of which are
required for effective levels of protease activity in the presence of
ATP [1], although the P subunit alone does possess some catalytic activity.
The clpP subunit is a serine protease that contains 2 residues (Ser and
His) of the triad (Ser, His and Asp) normally found in serine proteases,
although the sequence of clpP subunits shows no similarity to trypsin- or
subtilisin-like enzymes [1]. The clp enzyme is thus a unique class of
protease, which closely resembles a protein encoded by plant chloroplast
genomes.

CLPPROTEASEP is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
P subunit of the clp protease and related proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs
3 and 4 including the regions encoded by PROSITE patterns CLPP_PROTEASE_SER
(PS00381) and CLPP_PROTEASE_HIS (PS00382), which contain the active Ser and
His residues respectively. Two iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 7 sequences was
identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 40 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
