EGFLAMININ
Laminins are extracellular proteins whose primary sequences contain regions
of EGF-like repeats: these differ from both the type I EGF repeats of 
epidermal and transforming growth factors (see EGFTGF), and the type II 
EGF-like repeats occurring in coagulation factors, notch proteins, etc. 
(see EGFBLOOD) - this difference lies primarily in the exact nature of the 
Cys spacings, thus warranting a further classification of EGF-like motifs, 
the so-called type IIIs.

The laminins contain an A, a B1 and a B2 chain, each of which display the 
repeated type III EGF-like motif [1-3]. These domains have been shown to
contain growth factor activity [3] and, in view of the clear relationship 
between their amino acid sequences, it is believed they may share a common 
structural framework with the type I EGF repeat.

EGFLAMININ is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for type 
III EGF-like repeats. The fingerprint was derived from an initial align-
ment of 4 sequences: the motifs include a number of cysteines believed to
be involved in disulphide bond formation, motifs 1 and 2 spanning the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern EGF (PS00022). Four iterations on OWL12.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set of 12 sequences
was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences, and 6
partial matches.
