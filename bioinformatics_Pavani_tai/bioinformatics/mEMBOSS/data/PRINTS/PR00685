TIFACTORIIB
In eukaryotes, transcription initiation by polymerase II is modulated by
both general and specific transcription factors. The general factors (which
include TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIG and TFIIH) operate through
common promoter elements, such as the TATA box. 

Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is of central importance in transcription
of class II genes: it associates with TFIID-TFIIA bound to DNA (the DA 
complex) to form a ternary TFIID-IIA-IBB (DAB) complex, which is recognized
by RNA polymerase II [1,2]. TFIIB comprises ~315-340 residues and contains
an imperfect C-terminal repeat of a 75-residue domain that may contribute
to the symmetry of the folded protein.

TIFACTORIIB is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
transcription initiation factor IIB. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 4 including
part of the region encoded by PROSITE pattern TFIIB (PS00782), which lies
in the central section of the repeated domain. Two iterations on OWL29.1
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of
which are TFIIB transcription factor homologues or TFIIIB transcription
factors that fail to make a significant match with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 15 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
