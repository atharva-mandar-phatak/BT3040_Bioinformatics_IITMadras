ANTIFREEZIII
Marine teleosts from polar oceans can be protected from freezing in icy
sea-water by serum antifreeze proteins (AFPs) or glycoproteins (AFGPs) [1]:
these function by binding to, and preventing the growth of, ice crystals
within the fish. Despite functional similarity, the proteins are
structurally diverse and include glycosylated and at least 3 non-
glycosylated forms: the AFGP of nototheniids and cods are polymers of a
tripeptide repeat, Ala-Ala-Thr, with a disaccharide attached to the
threonine residue; type I AFPs are Ala-rich, alpha-helical peptides
found in flounder and sculpin; type II AFPs of sea-raven, smelt and
herring are Cys-rich proteins; and type III AFPs, found in eel pouts,
are rich in beta-structure.

ANTIFREEZIII is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
type III antifreeze proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL26.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 23
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, a
type III antifreeze protein fragment lacking the final 2 motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 20 sequences.
