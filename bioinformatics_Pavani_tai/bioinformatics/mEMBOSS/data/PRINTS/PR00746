GLHYDRLASE41
O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that
hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between
a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for
glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition
of up to 60 different families [1-4] (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/lists?
glycosid.txt).

Family 41 encompasses cytokinin-beta-glucosidases. These enzymes hydrolyse
cytokinin glucosides, liberating free cytokinins [5] and contribute to root-
inducing activity [6]. 

GLHYDRLASE41 is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
family 41 glycosyl hydrolases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL29.3
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
6 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
