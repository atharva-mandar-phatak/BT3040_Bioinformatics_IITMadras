BGCRYSTALLIN
The crystallins are water-soluble structural proteins that occur in high
concentration in the cytoplasm of eye lens fibre cells. Four major groups
of crystallin have been distinguished on the basis of size, charge and
immunological properties: alpha-, beta- and gamma-crystallins occur in all
vertebrate classes (though gamma-crystallins are low or absent in avian
lenses); and delta-crystallin is found exclusively in reptiles and birds
[1,2].

Both beta- and gamma-crystallins belong to the same family of highly
conserved proteins. They are found in high concentrations in the lens and
are responsible for its transparency. Beta- and gamma-crystallins display
high stability, characterised by their lack of turnover during the
life of the organism [3]. 

Structurally, each beta- and gamma-crystallin monomer is composed of two
domains that fold into 'Greek key' structures [4]. Beta-crystallins
differ from gamma-crystallins by virtue of their N- and C-terminal
extensions. Those beta-crystallins with acidic extensions are termed beta-A
crystallins, while those with basic extensions are termed beta-B crystallins
[5].

Beta-crystallins form dimers, whereas gamma-crystallins exist as monomers,
although the C- and N-terminal extensions are not involved in this.
Misfolding, aggregation and dissolution are believed to be responsible
for the formation of cataracts [6].

BGCRYSTALLIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
beta- and gamma-crystallin family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the first and second greek keys. Three iterations on 
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set 
comprising 73 sequences was identified.
