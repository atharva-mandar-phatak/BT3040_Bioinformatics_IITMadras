CHANNELTSX
The tsx gene of Escherichia coli encodes an outer membrane protein, Tsx,
which constitutes the receptor for colicin K and bacteriophage T6, and 
functions as a substrate-specific channel for nucleosides and deoxy-
nucleosides [1]. The protein contains 294 amino acids, the first 22 of 
which are characteristic of a bacterial signal sequence peptide [1]. The
putative mature form of Tsx contains 272 residues with a calculated Mr of
31418. The Tsx sequence shows an even distribution of charged residues
and lacks extensive hydrophobic stretches [1]. Tsx shows no significant
similarities to the channel-forming proteins OmpC, OmpF, PhoE and LamB
from the E.coli outer membrane.  

CHANNELTSX is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein Tsx. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length. A single iteration
on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being
identified beyond the starting set.
