NRIONCHANNEL
Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are transmembrane receptor complexes
that temporarily form channels on binding specific ligands, allowing rapid
transmission of signals at chemical synapses [1-3]. Five subtypes are known,
namely gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine,
serotonin 5HT3, and glutamte receptors [1-3].

The receptors are composed of varying numbers and types of subunit. Each
subunit contains a large extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding region;
3 hydrophobic transmembrane domains; a large intracellular region; and a
fourth hydrophobic domain [1-3]. The GABA, acetylcholine, serotonin 5HT3
and glycine receptors share a degree of sequence similarity, but differ
from the glutamate receptors - sequences of this family possess 2 Cys
residues in the N-terminal domain, which, in nicotinic receptors, form a
disulphide bond essential for correct folding of the structure.

NRIONCHANNEL is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 26 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions in the N-terminal domain, motif 3 including the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern NEUROTR_ION_CHANNEL (PS00236), which contains the 2
conserved cysteines. Three iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 149 sequences was
identified. Six partial matches were also found: SYNHUMACRS, ACHA_NAJNA,
ACHA_NATTE and ACHB_CHICK are nicotinic receptor fragments; ACHA_HUMAN is
a nicotinic receptor with a 25-residue insertion in motif 1; and CEC09G5
is a C.elegans GABA receptor that fails to make a significant match with
motif 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 221 sequences, and 30
partial matches.
