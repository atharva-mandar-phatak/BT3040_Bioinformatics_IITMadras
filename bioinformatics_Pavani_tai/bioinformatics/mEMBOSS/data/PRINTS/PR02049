PROTEINF36A
A short, approximately 120-residue amino acid polypeptide, designated 
protein FAM36A, has been identified in a wide range of organisms. The
protein is predicted to contain 2 transmembrane (TM) domains, and hence 
may act as a multi-pass membrane protein. However, its function is
currently unknown.

PROTEINF36A is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for protein 
family FAM36A. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 24
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full
alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 span the first predicted TM domain; and
motif 3 includes the second putative TM domain. Two iterations on
SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising of 31 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were
also found, each of which shares a high degree of similarity with 2 motifs.
