DAGPEDOMAIN
Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important second messenger; phorbol esters
(PE) are analogues of DAG and are potent tumour promoters that cause
a variety of physiological changes when administered to both cells and
tissues. DAG activates a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases known 
collectively as protein kinase C (PKC) [1]: PE's can stimulate PKC 
directly. The N-terminal region of PKC, known as C1, has been shown to 
bind PE and DAG in a phospholipid-dependent fashion [2]. The C1 region 
of PKC contains 1 or 2 copies of a Cys-rich region of about 50 amino acid 
residues, which is essential for DAG/PE binding.

DAGPEDOMAIN is a 4-element fingerprint that encodes this Cys-rich region. 
The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 13 sequences 
(A.Bairoch, personal communication): the motifs span the full length of
the DAG/PE binding domain. Two iterations on OWL10.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point every known occurrence of the motif was
detected (38 in all), together with an additional protein - the human vav
oncogene. The implication is that the vav oncogene may well bind DAG
and/or PE's and could thus be involved in signal transduction [3]. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 101 sequences, and 25
partial matches.
