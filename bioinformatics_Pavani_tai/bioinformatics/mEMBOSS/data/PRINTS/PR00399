SYNAPTOTAGMN
Synaptotagmins are synaptic vesicle membrane proteins found in abundance
in nerve cells and some endocrine cells [1,2]. The amino acid sequence
of synaptotagmin comprises a single transmembrane region with a short
vesicular N-terminus, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal region containing 2
internal repeats similar to the C2 regulatory domain of protein kinase C.
The protein is believed to be important in the docking and fusion of
synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, i.e. with neurotransmitter
release [1,2]. 

The 2 synaptotagmin C2 domains have been shown to have different functions:
C2A binds phospholipid in a calcium-dependent manner, while C2B binds
inositol polyphosphate and phospholipid irrespective of the presence of
Ca2+ [2]. The structure of C2 domains in synaptotagmin I has been deduced:
the C2 polypeptide forms an 8-stranded beta-sandwich constructed around a 
conserved 4-stranded motif, designated a C2 key [1]. The calcium binding
region is a cup-shaped depression formed by the N- and C-terminal loops
of the C2-key motif, while the site of phospholipid interaction is
thought to be a polybasic sequence on the hairpin loop connecting
strands 3 and 4 [1]. 

SYNAPTOTAGMN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
synaptotagmins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from strands 1, 2, 6 and 7 res.. Two
iterations on OWL26.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 20 sequences was identified. Three partial matches
were also found, which are closely related cellutagmin and rabphilins.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 34 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
