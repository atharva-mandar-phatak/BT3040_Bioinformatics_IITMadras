NEUROKININB
Tachykinins, which comprise a family of closely related peptides with
the common C-terminal sequence FxGLM, participate in the regulation of
diverse biological processes, such as neurotransmission and neuromodulation
[1-3]. Neurokinin B (also known as neuromedin K) is found predominantly in
the brain (in the main and accessory olfactory bulb, some cortical regions,
the olfactory tubercule, the nucleus accumbens, the septum, the neostriatum,
several hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra,
the medullary reticular formation and the external caudate nucleus) and in
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [2,3].

NEUROKININB is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
neurokinin B precursors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 lies near the
N-terminus, immediately after the signal peptide; motifs 2 and 3 reside in
the central region of the propeptide; motif 4 includes the region of the
propeptide encoding neurokinin B; and motif 5 lies at the C-terminus. A
single iteration on SPTR40_20f was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
