RIBONUCLEASE
Pancreatic ribonucleases (RNAse) are pyrimidine-specific endonucleases 
found in high quantity in the pancreas of certain mammalian taxa and of
some reptiles [1]. Specifically, the enzymes are involved in endonucleolytic
cleavage of 3'-phosphomononucleotides and 3'-phosphooligonucleotides ending
in C-P or U-P with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediates. Ribonuclease can
unwind the DNA helix by complexing with single-stranded DNA; the complex
arises by an extended multi-site cation-anion interaction between lysine
and arginine residues of the enzyme and phosphate groups of the nucleotides.

Other proteins belonging to the pancreatic RNAse family include: bovine
seminal vesicle and brain ribonucleases; kidney non-secretory ribonucleases
[2]; liver-type ribonucleases [3]; angiogenin, which induces vascularisation
of normal and malignant tissues; eosinophil cationic protein [4], a
cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with ribonuclease activity; and frog liver
ribonuclease and frog sialic acid-binding lectin.

The sequences of pancreatic RNases contain 4 conserved disulphide bonds and
3 amino acid residues involved in the catalytic activity, as depicted
schematically below:

C denotes the positions of cysteines involved in disulphide bond formation;
# marks active site residues. The structure of the protein has been
determined to 1.26A resolution [5]. The fold belongs to the alpha/beta
class, with a roll-type architecture.

RIBONUCLEASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
the pancreatic ribonuclease family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 1 spans helix
2 and the N-terminal portion of strand 1, and includes the region encoded
by PROSITE pattern RNASE_PANCREATIC (PS00127), which contains residues
involved both in the catalytic activity and in substrate binding; motif 2
spans helices 3 and 4 and strand 2; motif 3 includes strands 3 and 4; and
motif 4 includes strands 5 and 6. Three iterations on OWL29.4 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 85 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of which are
fragments and family members that fail to make significant matches with
one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 94 sequences, and 4
partial matches.
