ATPASEC
ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) is a component of the cyto-
plasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and
the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts [1,2]. The ATPase complex contains
an oligomeric transmembrane portion (CF0), which acts as a proton channel,
and a catalytic core (coupling factor CF1).

The c-subunit of CF0 is a hydrophobic protein that has been implicated
in the ATPase proton-conducting activity. It contains N- and C-terminal
hydrophobic regions (presumed to be membrane spanning), linked by a
central hydrophilic domain. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) can
bind covalently to a Glu or Asp residue near the centre of the C-terminal
TM region, abolishing ATPase activity.

ATPASEC is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for ATP
synthase c-subunits. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the transmembrane and loop
regions, motifs 2 and 3 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
ATPASE_C (PS00605), which includes the DCCD-binding acidic residue. Two
iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 65 sequences was identified. Five partial matches were
also found, each of which fails to make a significant match with one of the
motifs - ATPL_VIBAL matches well only with motif 2.  

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 102 sequences, and 11
partial matches.
