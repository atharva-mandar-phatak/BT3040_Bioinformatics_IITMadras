BREFELDNASP4
Brefeldin is a lactone antibiotic produced by fungi such as Eupenicillum 
brefeldianum. It both inhibits protein transport between the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and induces retrograde transport
from the Golgi to the ER, leading to protein accumulation within the ER.
Screening of a deletion-strain collection for mutants sensitive or resistant
to drugs that affect intracellular transport has revealed a number of 
mutants sensitive to brefeldin A: e.g., deletion of the BRE4 gene was shown
to result in brefeldin A-sensitivity [1]. The BRE4 gene product is predicted
to contain 10 transmembrane (TM) domains, suggesting that it is likely to be
an integral membrane protein, potentially involved in intracellular vesicle
transport [1]. 

BREFELDNASP4 is a 14-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
brefeldin A-sensitivity protein 4. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 13 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - a number of the 
motifs encodes regions predicted to be membrane-spanning. Two iterations on
SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 15 sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also
found (A7EIS1_SCLS1, Q6CUT1_KLULA and C5DK84_LACTC), each of which shares
similarity with two motifs.
