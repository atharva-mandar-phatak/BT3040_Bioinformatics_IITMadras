ANTIPRLFBTG1
A family of anti-proliferative proteins has been shown to include mammalian
and avian protein BTG1 (which appears to be involved in negative regulation
of cell proliferation) and rat/mouse NGF-inducible protein PC3/TIS21 [1-3].
The proteins contain 160-170 amino acids, whose sequences are highly
similar and include 3 conserved cysteine residues. 

ANTIPRLFBTG1 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
BTG1 family of anti-proliferative proteins. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 2, 4 and 5
each including a conserved cysteine - motifs 2 and 3 encompass the region
encoded by PROSITE pattern BTG1 (PS00960), which includes a perfectly
conserved 16-residue segment from the central section of the alignment.
Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 10
partial matches.
