RUBREDOXIN
Rubredoxin is a low molecular weight non-haem iron-containing bacterial
protein involved in electron transfer [1,2], sometimes replacing ferredoxin
as an electron carrier [3]. Its active site contains an iron atom co-
ordinated by the sulphurs of 4 conserved Cys residues residing on 2 loops
[2,3], which are the most well-conserved regions of the protein [3]. In
some species, the rubredoxin gene is closely linked to the dehydrogenase
gene, and its transcription is required for dehydrogenase activity [4]. The
reason for this is as yet unknown, but rubredoxin may act as a source of
electrons for the molecular hydrogen-splitting activity of the
dehydrogenase [4].

RUBREDOXIN is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
rubredoxins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 7
sequences: motifs 1 and 2 span the 2 loops involved in binding the
iron atom - motif 2 includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern
RUBREDOXIN (PS00202), which contains 2 of the iron-binding Cys residues.
Two iterations on OWL22.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 23 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 38 sequences.
