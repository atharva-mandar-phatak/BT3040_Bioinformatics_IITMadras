ACCSYNTHASE
ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) synthase is the key regulatory
enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the plant hormone ethylene [1]. It
catalyses the reaction  S-adenosyl-L-methionine = 1-aminocyclopropane-1-
carboxylate + methylthioadenosine. The enzyme functions as a homodimer and
requires pyridoxal-5'-phosphate as a cofactor. Sequence analysis has
shown the protein to contain several conserved amino acid residues found
in a related family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferases [2]. 
One of these residues is a lysine, which is involved in covalent binding of
the pyridoxal-phosphate group.

ACCSYNTHASE is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length - motif 7
includes the region encoded by PROSITE pattern AA_TRANSFER_CLASS_1 (PS00105),
which contains the lysine residue involved in pyridoxal phosphate binding.
Three iterations on OWL29.4 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 57 sequences was identified. Several partial
matches were also found, all of which are fragments or related amino-
transferases that match motifs 6 and 7.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 61 sequences.
