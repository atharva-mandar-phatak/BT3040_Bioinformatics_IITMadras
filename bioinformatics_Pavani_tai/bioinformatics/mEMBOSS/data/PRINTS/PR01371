BACYPHPHTASE
Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves 
transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell 
exterior [1]. There have been four secretion systems described in 
animal enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further 
sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [1].

The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to 
transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell 
[1] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with
the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of 
bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [1]. However, while the latter forms a
ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of
the flagellum itself [1], type III subunits in the outer membrane
translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.

Exotoxins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal,
and are considered unique for this reason [1]. Salmonella/Yersinia spp.  
secrete a protein, SptP, with tyrosine phosphatase activity [2,3]. SptP 
exerts its function by acting as a GTPase-activating protein [4], and 
counteracts the effects of SopE [4]. This is similar to the Yersinia 
exotoxin YopH, which degrades host cell signal transduction [3].

X-ray crystal structures of the Yersinia tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) in 
complex with tungstate and nitrate have been solved to 2.4A resolution [5].
The fold belongs to the alpha-beta class. The crystal structure reveals
that the nucleophilic cysteine (Cys 403) is positioned at the centre of a
distinctive phosphate-binding loop [5]. This loop is at the hub of
several hydrogen-bond arrays that not only stabilise a bound oxyanion, but
may activate Cys 403 as a reactive thiolate [5]. Binding of tungstate
triggers a conformational change that traps the oxyanion and swings Asp 356,
an important catalytic residue that resides in a flexible loop, by ~6A into
the active site [5]. 

BACYPHPHTASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
Salmonella/Yersinia type III secreted modular tyrosine phosphatases. The
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs
were drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length - 
motif 2 spans beta-strand 2 and part of alpha-helix 3; motif 3 spans strand
4 and the N-terminus of strand 5; motif 4 spans strand 7 and part of the
flexible loop that contains the putative general acid; and motif 5 spans
strand 8 and the phosphate-binding loop. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 5 
sequences was identified.
