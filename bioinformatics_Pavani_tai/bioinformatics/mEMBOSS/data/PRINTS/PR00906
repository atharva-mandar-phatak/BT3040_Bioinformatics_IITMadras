SECA
The secA protein is one of seven secretory proteins (secA-F and secY) that
form the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus. SecA has a central
role in coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the transfer of pre-secretory
periplasmic and outer membrane proteins across the membrane [1,2].

Homologues of secA are also encoded in chloroplast genomes of some algae
[3], as well as in the nuclear genome of some plants [4]; they may contain
a similar secA protein-dependent system for intra-organellar transport
into thylakoids.

SECA is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the secA
protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 9
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions in the hydrophobic
N-terminal and central portions of the alignment. Three iterations on
OWL30.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 32 sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found,
MBU43178 and ZMU71123, both of which are secA protein fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 33 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
