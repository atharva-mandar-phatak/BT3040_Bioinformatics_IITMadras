SPLICEFRBRR1
Bad Response to Refrigeration protein 1 (BRR1), a nuclear protein involved
in mRNA splicing, is required for snRNA accumulation and snRNP biogenesis 
[1-3]. It interacts with histone protein HTA1 and associates with the
spliceosome during snRNA and snRNP production [3]. 

SPLICEFRBRR1 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
pre-mRNA-splicing factor BRR1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 10 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR57.15_40.15f were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11
sequences was identified. A single partial match was found, Q6CVY1_KLULA, a
translation product from Kluyveromyces lactis that matches motifs 1-2 and 9.
