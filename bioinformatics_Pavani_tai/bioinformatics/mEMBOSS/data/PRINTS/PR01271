HISDACETLASE
Histone deacetylases (HDA), acetoin utilisation proteins (ACUC) and
acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases (APHA) form an ancient protein superfamily
and are all believed to catalyse the deacetylation of a substrate [1]. HDAs
are found in eukaryotes, from yeast to humans; ACUCs are found in 
eubacteria; and APHAs occur in archaeal bacteria, eubacteria and some
eukaryotic organisms [1]. HDA nomenclature is confusing: the family
can also be identified by the codes RPD, HOS, HD and HDAC, regardless of
specific sequence similarities [1]. HDAs may have evolved at least twice
from APHAs, the more recent gene duplication event resembling APHAs more 
closely [1].

Only the most highly conserved regions in the group of HDAs including RPD3
are similar to regions in the prokaryotic enzymes [2]. Many of the invariant
residues are histidine, glycine, cysteine, aspartic acid or glutamic acid,
and may be essential for maintaining structural integrity or catalytic
activity [1,2]. Histidines and acidic amino acids may be required for the
co-ordination of metal ion cofactors; APHA is known to contain one zinc ion
that is necessary for catalysis [2].

The crystal structure of a HDA homologue from the hyperthermophilic
bacterium Aquifex aeolicus has revealed that it has a single domain
structure belonging to the open alpha/beta class of folds [3]. It consists
of a central eight-stranded parallel beta-sheet and 16 alpha-helices [3].
Seven loops form an active site comprising a tubular pocket, a zinc-binding
site and two Asp-His charge relay systems; thus the active site has features
of metalloproteases and serine proteases [3].

HDAs function in multi-subunit complexes, reversing the acetylation of
histones by histone acetyltransferases [4,5], and are also believed to
deacetylate general transcription factors such as TFIIF and sequence-
specific transcription factors such as p53 [4]. Thus, HDAs contribute to 
the regulation of transcription, in particular transcriptional repression
[1-5]. At N-terminal tails of histones, removal of the acetyl group from
the epsilon-amino group of a lysine side chain will restore its positive
charge, which may stabilise the histone-DNA interaction and prevent
activating transcription factors binding to promoter elements [1]. HDAs
play important roles in the cell cycle and differentiation, and their
deregulation can contribute to the development of cancer [5,6].

HISDACETLASE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
histone deacetylases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning 
virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that
characterise the HDAs but distinguish them from the rest of the HDA
superfamily. Three iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 26 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, both of which are members
of the HDA superfamily that match 2 motifs.
