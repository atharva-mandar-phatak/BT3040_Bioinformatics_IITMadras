ANGIOTENSNGN
Angiotensinogen [1], is catalytically cleaved by renin to produce angio- 
tensin I in response to lowered blood pressure. Angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE), subsequently removes a dipeptide to produce angiotensin II,
the physiologically active peptide, which functions in the regulation of
volume and mineral balance of body fluids. Angiotensinogen is synthesised
in the liver and secreted in plasma. The protein belongs to the superfamily
of serine protease inhibitors.

Angiotensinogen appears to be associated with a predisposition to essential
hypertension; it is also associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension
(pih) (preeclampsia), a heterogeneous disorder that complicates 5-7% of all
pregnancies and remains a leading cause of maternal, foetal and neonatal
morbidity and mortality [2].

ANGIOTENSNGN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
angiotensinogen. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment 
of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
N-terminal half of the alignment. A single iteration on OWL29.1 was 
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set. Two partial matches were found, S78529 and S78530,
both of which are angiotensinogen fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
