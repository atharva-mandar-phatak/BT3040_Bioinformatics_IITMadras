ATPASEGAMMA
ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) is a component of the cyto-
plasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and
the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts [1,2]. The ATPase complex contains
an oligomeric transmembrane portion (CF0), which acts as a proton channel,
and a catalytic core (coupling factor CF1), which contains 5 subunits
(designated alpha to epsilon).

The catalytic core gamma subunit is thought to be important in the
regulation of ATPase activity and the flow of protons through the CF0
complex. A well-conserved region in the C-terminus [3] appears to be
essential for assembly and catalysis. 

ATPASEGAMMA is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
ATP synthase catalytic core gamma subunits. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 4
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern ATPASE_GAMMA (PS00153),
which lies at the C-terminus. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 28 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, which fails to
make significant matches with motifs 2 and 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 50 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
