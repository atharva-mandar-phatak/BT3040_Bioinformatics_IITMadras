ADVENDOPTASE
Cysteine protease activity is dependent on an active diad of cysteine and
histidine, the order and spacing of these residues varying in the 20 or so
known families. Families C1, C2 and C10 are loosely termed papain-like, and 
nearly half of all cysteine proteases are found exclusively in viruses [1].

Several adenovirus proteins are synthesised as precursors, requiring
processing by a protease before the virion is assembled [1,2]. Until
recently, the adenovirus endopeptidase was classified as a serine protease,
having been reported to be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors [1,3].
However, it has since been shown to be inhibited by cysteine protease
inhibitors, and the catalytic residues are believed to be His-54 and
Cys-104 [1,2].

ADVENDOPTASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
adenovirus endopeptidase (C5) family. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
N-terminal and active site regions - motif 1 lies at the N-terminus; motif
2 contains the active His; motif 3 includes an acidic residue that may
assist in catalysis; and motif 4 contains the active Cys. Three iterations
on OWL29.3 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 17 sequences was identified. A single partial match was also
found, VPRT_ADE04, an adenovirus endopeptidase that contains the active
Cys but otherwise shows little similarity to motif 4.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 18 sequences, and 1
partial match.
