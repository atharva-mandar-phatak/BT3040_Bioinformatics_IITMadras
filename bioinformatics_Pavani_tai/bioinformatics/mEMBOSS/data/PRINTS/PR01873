CYTCOXIDASE4
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit IV is a mitochondrial inner
membrane protein that forms part of the 13-subunit COX complex,
the terminal oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
The enzyme catalyses the reaction:

     4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome c + 2 H(2)O

This polypeptide belongs to a wider family of proteins that includes
the Dictyostelium discoideum COX VI and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
protein YGX6.

The 3D structure of the whole bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase has
been determined to 2.8A resolution by means of X-ray crystallography 
[1,2]. The structure reveals 13 different subunits, five phosphatidyl 
ethanolamines, three phosphatidyl glycerols, two cholates, two haems A,
and a number of copper, magnesium and zinc ions [1]. A hydrogen-bonded
system, including a propionate of heme A, part of the peptide backbone,
and an imidazole ligand of CuA, may provide an electron transfer path-
way between CuA and heme A [1]. 

CYTCOXIDASE4 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
areas that characterise type IV isoforms but distinguish them from
closely-related members of the cytochrome c oxidase IV family. Three
iterations on SPTR44_27f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 25 sequences was identified.
