MYELINMBP
The myelin sheath is a multi-layered membrane, unique to the nervous system,
that functions as an insulator to greatly increase the velocity of axonal
impulse conduction [1]. Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a hydrophilic protein
that may function to maintain the correct structure of myelin, interacting
with the lipids in the myelin membrane by electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions. In mammals, the alternative splicing of the myelin MBP gene
results in the production of several forms of the protein, which differ by
the presence or absence of various short stretches of the sequence. 

MYELINMBP is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
myelin basic proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length, motif 3 including the area encoded
by PROSITE pattern MYELIN_MBP (PS00569), which contains a characteristic
conserved pentapeptide. Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18 sequences was
identified. Two partial matches were also found, S25122 and HUMRNAMBPE, 
both of which are myelin MBP proteins lacking the third motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 13 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
