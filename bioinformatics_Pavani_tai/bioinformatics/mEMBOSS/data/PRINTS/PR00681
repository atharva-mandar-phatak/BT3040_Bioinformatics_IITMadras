RIBOSOMALS1
The S1 protein binds mRNA, facilitating recognition of the initiation point.
It is required to translate mRNA with short Shine-Dalgarno purine-rich
sequences, and is a member of the S1P family of ribosomal proteins.

Protein S1 is the largest component of the E.coli ribosome [1]. It has a
domain structure in which the ribosome-binding region is located towards
the N-terminus; the nucleic acid-binding domain, which is characterised
by several internal repeats (the so-called S1 motifs), lies in the central
portion of the sequence [1].

RIBOSOMALS1 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 30S
ribosomal protein S1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
N-terminal two-thirds of the alignment - motifs 1-6 span the ribosome-
binding domain; motif 7 lies in the first S1 motif of the nucleic acid-
binding domain; and motifs 8 and 9 lie in the second S1 motif. Two
iterations on OWL29.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 7 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are either fragments or S1 protein homologues.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 22
partial matches.
