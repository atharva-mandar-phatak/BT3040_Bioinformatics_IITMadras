MELANOCORTIN
Pro-opiomelanocortin is present in high levels in the pituitary and is
processed into 3 major peptide families: adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH);
alpha-, beta- and gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH); and
beta-endorphin [1]. ACTH regulates the synthesis and release of gluco-
corticoids and, to some extent, aldosterone in the adrenal cortex. It is
synthesised and released in response to corticotrophin-releasing factor
at times of stress (i.e. heat, cold, infection, etc.), its release leading
to increased metabolism. The action of MSH in man is poorly understood,
but it may be involved in temperature regulation [1]. Full activity of ACTH
resides in the first 20 N-terminal amino acids, the first 13 of which are
identical to alpha-MSH.  

MELANOCORTIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
pro-opiomelanocortins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: motifs 1-3 span the ACTH peptide, while motifs
4 and 5 were drawn from the beta-MSH peptide. Three iterations on OWL26.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
20 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all
of which are cleavage products of pro-opiomelanocortin.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 16 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
