ADAMTSFAMILY
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix plays a critical role in
establishing tissue architecture during development, and in tissue 
degradation in diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease
and a variety of inflammatory conditions [1]. The proteolytic enzymes 
responsible for this process are members of diverse protease families, 
including the secreted zinc metalloproteases (MPs) [1]. Recently, a new
MP family, ADAM-TS (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with 
thrombospondin type I modules) has been identified. The family consists
of at least 20 members that share a high degree of sequence similarity
and conserved domain organisation [2,3].

The defining domains of the ADAM-TS family are (from N- to C-termini) a
pre-pro metalloprotease domain of the reprolysin type, a snake venom
disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type-I (TS) module, a cysteine-
rich region, and a cysteine-free (spacer) domain [3]. Domain organisation
following the spacer domain C-terminus shows some variability in certain
ADAM-TS members, principally in the number of additional TS domains.

Members of the ADAM-TS family have been implicated in a range of diseases. 
ADAM-TS1, for example, is reported to be involved in inflammation and cancer
cachexia [2], whilst recessively inherited ADAM-TS2 mutations cause
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a disorder characterised clinically by 
severe skin fragility [4]. ADAM-TS4 is an aggrecanase involved in arthritic
destruction of cartilage [5].

ADAMTSFAMILY is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
ADAM-TS family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the 
N-terminal two thirds of the alignment - motif 1 lies in the first TS 
module; and motifs 2 and 3 reside in the cysteine-rich region between the 
first TS module and the spacer domain. Two iterations on SPTR40_22f were 
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 49 
sequences was identified. A single partial match was also found, Q8MSF8, an
uncharacterised translated Drosophila cDNA that matches motifs 1 and 2.
