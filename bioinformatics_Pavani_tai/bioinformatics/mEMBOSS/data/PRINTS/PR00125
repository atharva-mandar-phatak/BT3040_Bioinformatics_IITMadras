ATPASEDELTA
ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) is a component of the cyto-
plasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and
the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts [1,2]. The ATPase complex contains
an oligomeric transmembrane portion (CF0), which acts as a proton channel,
and a catalytic core (coupling factor CF1), which contains 5 subunits
(designated alpha to epsilon).

The catalytic core delta subunit (referred to as oligomycin sensitivity
conferral protein, OSCP, in mitochondria) appears to be part of the stalk 
that links CF0 and CF1, in which context it either transmits conformational
changes from CF0 into CF1, or is implicated in proton conduction [3]. Delta
subunits contain around 200 amino acids, the proteins from different
sources exhibiting only moderate sequence similarity.

ATPASEDELTA is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
ATP synthase catalytic core delta subunits. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 12 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motifs 
4 and 5 including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern ATPASE_DELTA
(PS00389), which lies at the C-terminus. Two iterations on OWL24.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 26
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, which
lack significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 40 sequences, and 22
partial matches.
