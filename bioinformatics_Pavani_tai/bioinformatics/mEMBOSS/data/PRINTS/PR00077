GPDHDRGNASE
NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) catalyses the
conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate to glycerone phosphate in the presence
of NAD. It is a eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein, active as a homodimer [1],
each monomer containing an N-terminal NAD binding site [2]. In insects, it
acts in conjunction with a mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase in
the alpha-glycerophosphate cycle, which is essential for the production of
energy used in insect flight [1].

GPDHDRGNASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif
1 including the proposed NAD binding site, and motif 2 containing the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern NAD_G3PDH (PS00957), the conserved His
of which is implicated in the catalytic mechanism. Two iterations on
OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 15 sequences was identified. Four partial matches were also
found: C32937 is a G3PDH fragment lacking the first 2 motifs; PLU12977
is a G3PDH homologue that lacks motif 1 and shows limited similarity to
motif 2; and DHNO_AGRT7 and A06498 are D-nopaline dehydrogenases, which
show some similarity to motifs 1 and 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 33 sequences, and 9
partial matches.
