INTRLEUKIN20
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-20 (IL-20) belongs to the family of IL-10-related cytokines, 
which includes IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [1]. IL-20 induces STAT 
activation through two types of receptor complex, one of which it shares
with IL-19, indicating that their biological activities may overlap [2]. 
Both cytokines may play an important role in regulating the development
and proper functioning of skin [2]. IL-20 has also been shown to promote 
endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that it may be involved in
vascular vessel maturation and remodelling [3].

INTRLEUKIN20 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-20. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q2THG6_HUMAN, a short
form of human interleukin-20 that fails to match motif 3.
