EGFTGF
Epidermal growth factors and transforming growth factors belong to a
general class of proteins that share a repeat pattern involving a number 
of conserved Cys residues. Growth factors are involved in cell recognition 
and division [1]: the repeating pattern, especially of cysteines (the 
so-called EGF repeat), is thought to be important to the 3D structure of 
the proteins, and hence its recognition by receptors and other molecules.

The EGF motif is found frequently in nature, particularly in extracellular 
proteins. The spacing of conserved cysteines, however, is variable, and for
this reason 2 further EGF, or EGF-like, motifs, have been classified - see 
signatures EGFBLOOD and EGFLAMININ. 

EGFTGF is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for type I 
EGF repeats. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 9 
sequences (after Campbell et al., [1]): the motifs include 6 conserved
cysteines believed to be involved in disulphide bond formation, motifs 3
and 4 spanning the region encoded by PROSITE pattern EGF (PS00022). Four
iterations on OWL12.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a 
true set comprising 12 sequences was identified: these included epidermal,
transforming and viral growth factors. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 22 sequences, and 21
partial matches.
