ROPREGULATRY
The Rop protein regulates plasmid DNA replication by modulating the
initiation of transcription of the primer RNA precursor. Processing of the
precursor, RNAII, is inhibited by hydrogen bonding of RNAII to its
complementary sequence in RNAI. Rop increases the affinity of RNAI for RNAII
and thus decreases the rate of replication initiation events.

The 3D structure of Rop has been determined by X-ray crystallography and 
refined to 1.7A resolution [1]. The 63 amino acid protein is a homodimer,
each monomer consisting almost entirely of two alpha-helices, the whole
molecule forming a highly regular four-alpha-helix bundle [1]. This can be
approximated by a four-stranded rope, with radius 7.0 A, a left-handed 
helical twist, and pitch 172.5A. A very compact packing of side chains in 
the helix interfaces of the Rop coiled-coil structure is presumed to account
for its high stability [2]. The overall details of the structure have been
confirmed by proton NMR [2,3].

ROPREGULATRY is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Rop family of regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1 and 2 span the first
alpha-helix; and motifs 3 and 4 encompass the small second helix and the
main third helix. A single iteration on OWL30.0 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
