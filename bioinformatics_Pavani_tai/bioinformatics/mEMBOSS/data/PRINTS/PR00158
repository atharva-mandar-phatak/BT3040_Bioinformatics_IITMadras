RUSTICYANIN
Type I blue copper proteins are found in methylothropic bacteria, where
they appear to function as the electron acceptor to methylamine dehydro-
genase [1]. They bind a single copper atom and are characterised by an
intense electronic absorption band near 600nm [2]. Several subclasses of
the blue copper proteins, such as the amicyanins, azurins, plastocyanins
and rusticyanins, have been identified. Although there is an appreciable
amount of divergence in the sequences of these proteins, the copper 
ligand sites are conserved. 

Rusticyanin from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is an electron carrier from
cytochrome c-552 to the a-type oxidase. The NMR structure indicates the
fold to be a compact beta-barrel or beta-sandwich, which contains a
hydrophobic core rich in aromatic residues [3]. Its sequence is highly
diverged from related copper-blue proteins, but it has a similar active
site, containing conserved His and Cys residues responsible for binding
copper.

RUSTICYANIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
rusticyanins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
full alignment length, motif 6 including the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern COPPER_BLUE (PS00196), which contains the conserved Cys and His
copper ligands. A single iteration on OWL25.2 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
