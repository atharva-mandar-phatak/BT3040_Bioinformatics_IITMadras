MTP1FAMILY
Two major structural proteins from the lactococcal temperate bacteriophage
TP901-1 have been sequenced: the Major Head Protein (MHP) and the Major Tail
Protein (MTP) [1]. Homologues of the major tail protein have since been
found in Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus phages. The
sequences are fairly short, typically ~150-200 amino acid residues in 
length, and are well conserved. This family of proteins (designated here
phage MTP 1) has its own distinct sequence signature that distinguishes it
from the MTP 2 family (see MTP2FAMILY). 

Sequences belonging to the MTP 1 family are shorter than those belonging to
the MTP 2 family (typically ~140 amino acid residues in length), and are
well conserved across a range of species. 

MTP1FAMILY is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
phage major tail protein 1 family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 68 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
71 sequences was identified. Seven partial matches were also found, all of
which are family members that fail to make signficant matches with motifs
1 and 4.
