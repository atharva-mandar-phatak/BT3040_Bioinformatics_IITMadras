GRAVESDC
Graves disease carrier protein (GDC) is a protein of as yet uncharacterised
function that belongs to the mitochondrial metabolite carrier family 
(which includes the ADP/ATP translocator, the phosphate carrier and the
hydrogen ion uncoupling protein) [1,2]. The protein is recognised by IgG 
from patients with active Graves disease.

GDC is an integral membrane protein thought to reside in the inner
mitochondrial membrane. The predicted amino acid sequence of 348 residues 
comprises three similar domains.

GRAVESDC is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for Graves
disease carrier proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved 
regions spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1-3 span the N-terminal
domain; motif 4 lies in the central domain; and motifs 5 and 6 span the
C-terminal domain. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
A single partial match was found, YHG2_YEAST, a putative mitochondrial 
carrier protein from S.cerevisiae.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences, and 1
partial match.
