AUTOPHGYRP14
Macroautophagy is a bulk degradation process induced by starvation in
eukaryotic cells [1]. In yeast, 15 autophagy (Apg) proteins coordinate the
formation of autophagosomes. Apg14p and Vps30p/Apg6p, components of an 
autophagy-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, together with 
Apg9p and Apg16p, are required for localisation of Apg5p and Aut7p to a 
pre-autophagosome structure that functions in autophageosome formation
[1,2]. Mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG14 gene have been shown
to cause defects in autophagy [5]. 

AUTOPHGYRP14 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
autophagy-related protein 14. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 encodes the beginning of a 
coiled coil structure. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10 sequences was
identified. A single partial match was also found, C5DLA9_LACT, a protein
from Lanchancea thermotolerans that fails to make a signficant match with
motif 2.
