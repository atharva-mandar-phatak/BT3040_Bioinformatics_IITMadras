PAXILLIN
Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein involved in actin-membrane attachment at
sites of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (focal adhesion) [1,2].
Extensive tyrosine phosphorylation occurs during integrin-mediated cell
adhesion, embryonic development, fibroblast transformation and following
stimulation of cells by mitogens that operate through the 7TM family of 
of G protein-coupled receptors [2]. Paxillin binds in vitro to the focal
adhesion protein vinculin, as well as to the SH3 domain of c-Src, and, when
tyrosine phosphorylated, to the SH2 domain of v-Crk [2]. An N-terminal
region has been identified that supports the binding of both vinculin and
the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, pp125Fak [2].

Paxillin is a 68kDa protein containing multiple domains, including four 
tandem C-terminal LIM domains (each of which binds 2 zinc ions); an 
N-terminal proline-rich domain, which contains a consensus SH3 binding site;
and three potential Crk-SH2 binding sites [1]. The predicted structure of
paxillin suggests that it is a unique cytoskeletal protein capable of
interaction with a variety of intracellular signalling and structural
molecules important in growth control and the regulation of cytoskeletal
organisation [1,2]. 

PAXILLIN is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
paxillins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the 
N-terminal half of the alignment - motif 2 includes the Pro-rich region; 
and motif 4 includes the tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated by Fak.
A single iteration on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence, no
further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 5 sequences.
