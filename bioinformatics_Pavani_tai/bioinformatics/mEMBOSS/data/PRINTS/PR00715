MAN6PRECEPTR
The cation dependent mannose-6-phosphate (man-6-P) receptor is one of two
transmembrane proteins involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes from
the Golgi complex and the cell surface to lysosomes [1]. Lysosomal enzymes
bearing phosphomannosyl residues bind specifically to man-6-P receptors in
the Golgi apparatus and the resulting receptor-ligand complex is transported
to an acidic prelyosomal compartment, where the low pH mediates dissociation
of the complex. Binding is optimal in the presence of divalent cations.

The amino acid sequence is a single polypeptide chain that contains a
putative signal sequence and a transmembrane domain [2]. Studies have
indicated that the receptor is a transmembrane protein with an
extracytoplasmic N-terminal domain [2]. This domain contains all the
information necessary both for ligand binding and for acid-dependent
ligand dissociation [3].

MAN6PRECEPTR is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
mannose-6-phosphate receptors. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1-7 span the putative lumenal
domain; motif 8 lies in a putative TM domain; and motif 9 lies in the
proposed cytoplasmic domain. A single iteration on OWL29.3 was required
to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the
starting set. Three partial matches were found, all of which are
mannose-6-phosphate receptor fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
