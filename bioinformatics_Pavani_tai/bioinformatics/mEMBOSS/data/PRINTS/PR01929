INTRLEUKIN13
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-13 (IL-13) inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and 
synergises with IL-2 in regulating interferon-gamma synthesis [1]. It has 
been identified as a central mediator of allergic asthma [2].

INTRLEUKIN13 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-13. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 4
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length, motifs 1, 3 and 4 encompassing short helical 
regions. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 22 sequences was identified. Two partial
matches were also found, Q4VB51_HUMAN and Q4VB53_HUMAN, both of which are 
translated human cDNA sequences that fail to match motif 1.
