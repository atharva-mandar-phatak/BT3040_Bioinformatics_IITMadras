NEUROLIGIN
Neuroligins constitute a family of brain neurone-specific membrane proteins
whose structural and biochemical characteristics are indicative of a role in
heterotypic cell adhesion [1]. Functionally, they bind to the extracellular
domains of a subset of beta-neurexins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. They have
been localised to the postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses [2].
This, together with the fact that their C-termini likely bind to PSD-95 (a
PDZ-domain protein enriched in postsynaptic densities), suggests that they
may be involved in the recruitment of proteins (such as receptors, ion
channels and signal-transduction molecules) to synaptic sites of cell
adhesion.

To date, three neuroligins have been reported, designated neuroligin 1-3 [3].
Multiple sequence alignment has revealed them to be highly similar, sharing
overall ~52% identity. The similarity is distributed over the whole protein
sequence, with the extracellular and transmembrane (TM) domains being more
conserved than the cytoplasmic regions. They are composed of five domains:
an N-terminal cleaved signal sequence; a large extracellular region 
homologous to esterases; a linker between the TM domain and the esterase 
homology domain that may be O-glycosylated; a single TM domain; and a
cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Further sequence comparisons place the
neuroligins into the large family of esterase homology domain proteins, 
which includes thyroglobulin, acetylcholinesterase, and gliotactin,
although the neuroligins are themselves catalytically inactive.

NEUROLIGIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
neuroligins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 3
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions within the
C-terminal half of the molecule - motifs 1-3 encode portions of the
esterase homology domain, located after the two alternate splice sites; and
motif 4 spans the junction between the linker region and the putative
TM domain. A single iteration on OWL31.1 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
