TGFBETA2
The transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta 1-5) constitute a family of
multi-functional cytokines that regulate cell growth and differentiation [1].
Many cells synthesise TGF-beta, and essentially all have specific receptors 
for this peptide [2]. TGF-beta regulates the actions of many other peptide
growth factors and determines a positive or negative direction of their 
effects. The protein functions as a disulphide-linked homodimer. Its
sequence is characterised by the presence of several C-terminal cysteine
residues, which form interlocking disulphide links arranged in a knot-like
topology. A similar "cystine-knot" arrangement has been noted in the
structures of some enzyme inhibitors and neurotoxins that bind to voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels, although the precise topology here differs. 

The complete amino acid sequence of human beta 2 transforming growth factor
(hTGF-beta 2) has been determined by automated Edman degradation [3]. Human
TGF-beta 2 consists of 2 identical disulphide-linked subunits that share a
high degree of similarity with the functionally related TGF-beta 1, and 
reveal lower levels of similarity to porcine inhibins and activins, the 
C-terminal regions of human Mullerian inhibiting substance, and the putative
decapentaplegic gene complex protein of Drosophila [3]. 

The three-dimensional structures of several members of the TGF-beta super-
family have been deduced. The crystal structure of the TGF-beta 2 monomer 
lacks a well-defined hydrophobic core and displays an unusual elongated 
non-globular fold [5]. Eight cysteine residues form 4 intra-chain disulphide
bonds, creating the characteristic knotted arrangement. The dimer is 
stabilised by a ninth cysteine, which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond,
and by 2 identical hydrophobic interfaces. Other members of the TGF-beta
superfamily, including activins, inhibins and various developmental factors,
are also likely to adopt the TGF-beta fold. 

TGFBETA2 is an 8-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
transforming growth factor beta 2 precursor proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the N-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on
those sections that characterise TGF-beta 2 proteins but distinguish them
from the rest of the TGF-beta superfamily. Two iterations on SPTR39_14f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 10 
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, TGF3_RAT and
TGF3_MOUSE, both of which are TGF-beta 3 proteins that match motifs 1 and 3.
