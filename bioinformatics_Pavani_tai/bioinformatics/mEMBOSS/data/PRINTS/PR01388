CDTOXINB
Escherichia coli, Haemophilus spp. and Campylobacter spp. all produce 
a toxin that is seen to cause distension in certain cell lines [1,2],
which eventually disintegrate and die. This novel toxin, termed cytolethal 
distending toxin (cdt), has three subunits: A, B, and C. Their sizes are 
approx. 27.7, 29.5 and 19.9kDa respectively [1], and they appear to be 
entirely novel [2]. 

Further research on the complete toxin has revealed that it blocks the cell
cycle at stage G2, through inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1
[3], and without induction of DNA breaks. This leads to multipolar abortive
mitosis and micronucleation, associated with centrosomal amplification [3].
The roles of each subunit are unclear, but it is believed that they have
separate roles in pathogenicity.

CDTOXINB is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for cytolethal
distending toxin B proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length (~270 amino acids). Two iterations on
SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 7 sequences was identified.
