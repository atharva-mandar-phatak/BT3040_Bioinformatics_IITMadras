EUOM20RECPTR
Virtually all mitochondrial precursors are imported via the same 
mechanism [1]: precursors first bind to receptors on the mitochondrial
surface, then insert into the translocation channel in the outer membrane.
Many outer-membrane proteins participate in the early stages of import,
4 of which (MAS20, MAS22, MAS37 and MAS70) are components of the receptor.
MAS20, which forms a subcomplex with MAS22, seems to interact with most or
all mitochondrial precursors, suggesting that the protein binds directly
to mitochondrial targeting sequences. The MAS37 and MAS70 components also
form a subcomplex, the 2 subcomplexes possibly binding via their trans-
membrane (TM) regions - the TM region of MAS70 promotes oligomerisation
of attatched protein domains and shares sequence similarity with the
TM region of MAS20 [2]. 

The human homologue of the fungal MAS20 (TOM20) import receptor has been
identified and characterised [3]. Although the amino acid sequences exhibit
pronounced differences, similarity is greatest in the N-terminal third of
the molecules. The structure of the rat TOM20 import receptor has been
determined by NMR [4]. The cytosolic domain forms an all-alpha structure,
with a hydrophobic groove that mediates presequence binding [4].

EUOM20RECPTR is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
metazoan eukaryotic MAS20 (TOM20) import receptor subunit. The fingerprint 
was derived from an initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise the eukaryotic receptors but distinguish them
from the rest of the MAS20 (TOM20) family. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f 
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 12
sequences was identified. Seven partial matches were also found, all of
which are TOM20-like proteins that fail to make significant matches with
two or more motifs.
