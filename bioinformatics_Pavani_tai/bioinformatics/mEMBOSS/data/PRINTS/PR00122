VACATPASE
Several vacuolar organelles of eukaryotic cells have acidic interiors
caused by an electrochemical proton gradient created by vacuolar ATPase 
[1], which continually pumps protons into them. Although the proton
gradient is not great enough to synthesise ATP (even at low concentrations
of ATP), it is essential for some organelle functions, including
accumulation of hormones and neurotransmitters in secretory granules, and
acidification of lysosomes to create optimal conditions for lysozyme
hydrolases [2].

Vacuolar ATPase is distinct from 2 other forms of membrane ATPase (plasma
membrane and eubacterial), although the structures of all 3 types are
similar [3]. The protein comprises 2 main domains: a membrane bound domain,
which contains at least 2 different subunits (20kDa and 16kDa); and a
peripheral domain, which contains an ATP hydrolysis site. The 16kDa
subunit of the membrane domain has 4 transmembrane regions, and has been
implicated in the proton-conducting role of the enzyme. Electron microscopy 
studies have shown that vacuolar ATPase has a 'ball and stalk' structure
resembling that of the mitochondrial F-ATPase [4].

VACATPASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
16kDa proteolipid subunit of vacuolar ATP synthase. The fingerprint was 
derived from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn
from conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two
iterations on OWL19.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point 
a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 38 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
