FLAGELLIN
Bacterial flagella are responsible for motility and chemotaxis [1]. They
comprise a basal body, a hook and a filament, the latter accounting for 98%
of the mass [2]. Flagellin is the subunit protein that polymerises to form
the flagellae [3], the subunits being transported through the centre of the
filament to the tip, where they then polymerize [1]. Both the N- and C-
termini of the subunit protein, which are alpha-helical in structure [1],
are required to mediate polymerisation. Although no export or assembly
consensus sequences have been identified, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Gly, Ser,
Thr, Asn, Gln and Asp tend to make up around 90% of the sequence, Cys and
Trp being absent [2].

FLAGELLIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
bacterial flagellins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from well-conserved N-terminal
regions. Five iterations on OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 64 sequences was identified. Five partial
matches were also found, most of which are flagellins that fail to make a
significant match with motif 2.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 148 sequences, and 11
partial matches.
