OUTRSURFACE
The ospA and ospB genes encode the major outer membrane proteins of the
Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi [1]. The deduced gene products
OspA and OspB, contain 273 and 296 residues respectively [1]. The two Osp
proteins show a high degree of sequence similarity, indicating a recent
evolutionary event. Molecular analysis and sequence comparison of OspA and
OspB with other proteins has revealed similarity to the signal peptides of
prokaryotic lipoproteins [1,2]. 

OUTRSURFACE is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
outer surface proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 20 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Three iterations
on OWL30.2 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true 
set comprising 95 sequences was identified. Numerous partial matches
were also found, virtually all of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 56 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
