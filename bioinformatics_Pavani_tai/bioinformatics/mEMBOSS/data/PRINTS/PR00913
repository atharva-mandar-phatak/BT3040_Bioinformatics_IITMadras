LVIRUSORF2
The nucleotide sequence for the RNA of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) has
been determined [1,2]. The sequence contains six large open reading frames
(ORFs). The 5' coding region encodes two polypeptides of 28K and 70K, which 
overlap in different reading frames; it is suggested that the third ORF in 
the 5' block is translated by frameshift readthrough near the end of the 70K 
protein, yielding a 118K polypeptide [1]. Segments of the predicted amino
acid sequences of these ORFs resemble those of known viral RNA polymerases, 
ATP-binding proteins and viral genome-linked proteins.

The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of beet western yellow virus
(BWYV) has been determined [3]. The sequence contains six long ORFs. A 
cluster of three of these ORFs, including the coat protein cistron, display
extensive amino acid sequence similarity to corresponding ORFs of a second
luteovirus, the PAV isolate of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) [3].

LVIRUSORF2 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
luteovirus ORF2 putative replicase 1 family. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short
conserved regions spanning the C-terminal half of the alignment. A single
iteration on OWL30.1 was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. A single partial match
was found, JQ1383, a hypothetical protein from pea enation mosaic virus
that matches motifs 2 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences.
