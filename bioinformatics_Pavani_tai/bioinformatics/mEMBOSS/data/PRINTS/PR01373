YERSSTKINASE
Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves 
transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell 
exterior [1]. There have been four secretion systems described in 
animal enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further 
sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [1]. 

The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to 
transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell 
[1] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with
the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of 
bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [1]. However, while the latter forms a
ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of
the flagellum itself [1], type III subunits in the outer membrane
translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.

Exotoxins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal,
and are considered unique for this reason [1]. Yersinia spp. secrete a 
serine/threonine kinase, YpkA, [2,3] that causes autophosphorylation of host 
cell components, although the exact targets are unknown at present [4]. It 
has also been suggested that the YpkA protein is involved in interference
of signal transduction in the target cell [4].

YERSSTKINASE is an 11-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
Yersinia type III-secreted Ser/Thr kinases. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~690 amino acids).
Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified.
