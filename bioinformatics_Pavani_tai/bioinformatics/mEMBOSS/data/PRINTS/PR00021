PRORICH
Keratinocytes from the skin epidermis are functionally specialised to
protect against the damaging effects of external agents, including 
ultraviolet (UV) light [1]. The presence of damage somewhere in genomic DNA
activates a signal transduction cascade, which results in the expression of
a number of genes, including the gene for small proline-rich proteins [2].
These proteins are rich in Pro, Cys and Gln and are either structural 
proteins or metal-binding proteins. They can also bind DNA, however, since 
they contain many Lys, Ser and Thr residues, which are known to mediate 
DNA-binding in repressor proteins [1]. Small proline-rich proteins are also
found in higher concentrations during normal keratinocyte differentiation, 
although the reason for this is unclear [2].

PRORICH is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for small 
proline-rich repeats. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: in general, motifs were drawn from conserved Gln/Pro/Cys-
rich regions. A single iteration on OWL20.0 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
A single partial match was also found, S48958, which fails to make a
significant match with motif 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 24 sequences, and 8
partial matches.
