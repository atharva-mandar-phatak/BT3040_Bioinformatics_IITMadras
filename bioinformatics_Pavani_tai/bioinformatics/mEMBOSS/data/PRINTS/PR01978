IGFBPFAMILY2
Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)-I and -II are small secreted peptides
that stimulate the survival, and promote the proliferation and
differentiation, of many cell types [1]. In biological fluids, these growth
factors are usually bound to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which regulate
their availability and activity by prolonging their half-life and
modulating their receptor interactions.

To date, six IGFBP family members have been identified (termed IGFBP1-6)
[2]. They share a conserved gene (intron-exon) organisation and high IGF
binding affinity. Structurally, the proteins also share a common domain
architecture, possessing a conserved N-terminal IGFBP domain, a highly
variable mid-section, and a thyroglobulin type-1 (Tg1) domain in their
C-terminal regions.

In addition to their role in the regulation of IGF activity, there is
evidence for the direct association of IGFBPs with a variety of
extracellular and cell surface molecules [3,4], with consequent effects
upon important biological processes. These include modulation of bone cell
proliferation [5], and growth arrest of breast and prostate cancer cells
[3,6].

IGFBP2 is involved in a variety of biological processes, including the 
regulation of cell adhesion, migration and proliferation [7]. The protein 
is overexpressed in a number of carcinomas [8,9], and increased IGFBP2 
concentrations have been described in serum and cyst fluids surrounding 
tumours of different histologies, such as lung tumours, prostate cancer and
brain tumours [10]. Consequently, IGFBP2 may represent a valuable marker 
for tumour diagnosis and surveillance.

IGFBPFAMILY2 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from 
conserved regions in the N- and C-terminal thirds of the alignment,
focusing on those sections that characterise IGFBP2 but distinguish it from
other family members - motif 1 resides within the IGFBP domain; motif
2 lies partially within the Tg1 domain; and motif 3 resides wholly within 
the Tg1 domain. Two iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to reach 
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 16 sequences was 
identified. A single partial match was also found, Q9D057_MOUSE, a 
mouse sequence that fails to match motif 1.
