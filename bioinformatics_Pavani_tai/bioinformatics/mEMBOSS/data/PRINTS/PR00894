YEASTMRS6P
The product of the S.cerevisiae gene MRS6 (Mrs6p) [1] shows significant
similarity both to the mammalian GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) of Rab-
type small G proteins [2,3] and to the human choroideraemia protein
(component A of Rab-specific GGTase II) [4]. Disruption of the MRS6 gene is
lethal to haploid yeast cells; this is consistent with the notion that Mrs6p
interacts with Rab proteins, which are known to have essential functions in 
vesicular transport. Mrs6p has also been shown to affect mitochondrial
functions [1]. 

YEASTMRS6P is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for yeast
Mrs6p proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved sections spanning
virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those regions that
characterise the Mrs6p proteins but distinguish them from the related
Rab GDI/REP family. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was required to reach
convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 2 sequences.
