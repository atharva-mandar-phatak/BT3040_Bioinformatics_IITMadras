PBPGOBP
Pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) are abundant, secreted antennal proteins 
present in olfactory sensilla - specifically, they lie in the lymph that
surrounds the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons [1]. They are thought
to transport hydrophobic pheromones across this aqueous fluid to receptor
molecules in the dendritic membranes. Another group of proteins, the
so-called general odorant-binding proteins (GOBPs) have also been found
in moth antennae. They share a high level of sequence similarity with the
PBPs and are believed to carry odorants rather than pheromones. This
family is distinct from the vertebrate odorant-binding proteins (OBPs).

PBPGOBP is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
PBP/GOBP family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL27.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 14
sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 17 sequences, and 1
partial match.
