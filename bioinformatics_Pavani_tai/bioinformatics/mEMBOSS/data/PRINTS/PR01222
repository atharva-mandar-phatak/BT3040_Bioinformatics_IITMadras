ATROPHIN
Human genes containing triplet repeats can markedly expand in length, 
leading to neuropsychiatric disease [1]. Expansion of triplet repeats 
explains the phenomenon of anticipation, i.e. the increasing severity or 
earlier age of onset in successive generations in a pedigree [1]. 
Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA, or Smith's disease) is one of 
five disorders now known to result from expansion of a CAG trinucleotide
repeat encoding glutamine [2].

The reported full length cDNA sequence encodes a serine repeat and a region
of alternating acidic and basic amino acids, in addition to the glutamine
repeat [2,3]. It is believed that the pathology of DRPLA may arise from the 
altered structure and function of the abnormal protein [2]. Although the 
function of the protein is still unknown, its unusual amino acid composition
may provide clues toward understanding neurodegenerative diseases associated
with triplet repeat expansion [3]. 

ATROPHIN is a 14-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
atrophins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to 
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was 
identified. Four partial matches were also found, all of which are 
atrophin-related proteins that largely match the C-terminal motifs.
