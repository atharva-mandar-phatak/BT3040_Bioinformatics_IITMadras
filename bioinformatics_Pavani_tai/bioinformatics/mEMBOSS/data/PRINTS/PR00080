SDRFAMILY
Primary sequence comparisons have indicated that a number of short-chain
dehydrogenases and reductases belong to an evolutionarily related family
(now termed the SDR family) [1]. Most dehydrogenases possess at least 2 
domains [2], the first binding the coenzyme, often NAD, and the second 
binding the substrate. This latter domain determines the substrate
specificity and contains amino acids involved in catalysis. Little sequence
similarity has been found in the coenzyme binding domain although there is 
a large degree of structural similarity, and it has therefore been 
suggested that the structure of dehydrogenases has arisen through gene 
fusion of a common ancestral coenzyme nucleotide sequence with various 
substrate specific domains [2].

SDRFAMILY is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
SDR superfamily. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
11 sequences: motif 1 spans a  highly conserved NNAGI sequence, and motif 3
the conserved YSASK sequence encoded by PROSITE pattern ADH_SHORT (PS00061).
Six iterations on OWL11.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 49 sequences was identified. Six partial matches were 
also found.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 272 sequences, and 177
partial matches.
