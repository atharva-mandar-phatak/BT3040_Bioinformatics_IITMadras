FACTINCAPB
The actin filament system, a prominent part of the cytoskeleton in 
eukaryotic cells, is both a static structure and a dynamic network that
can undergo rearrangements: it is thought to be involved in processes
such as cell movement and phagocytosis [1], as well as muscle contraction.
Capping proteins bind to the ends of actin filaments, blocking the addition
of actin monomers at this end. The capping protein is a heterodimer of alpha
and beta subunits [2]: it binds to the barbed end of actin filaments, but
unlike gelsolin and severin does not sever the filament [1]. Neither of the
subunits shows sequence similarity to other filament-capping proteins [1].

FACTINCAPB is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
F-actin capping protein beta subunit. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 3 including
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern F_ACTIN_CAPPING_BETA (PS00231).
Two iterations on OWL23.2 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 5 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 8 sequences.
