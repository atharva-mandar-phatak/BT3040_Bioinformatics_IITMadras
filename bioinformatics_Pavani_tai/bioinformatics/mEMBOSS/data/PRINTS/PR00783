MINTRINSICP
A number of transmembrane (TM) channel proteins can be grouped together
on the basis of sequence similarities [1-5]. These include: mammalian major
intrinsic protein (MIP), the major component of lens fibre gap junctions;
mammalian  aquaporins, which form water-specific channels in plasma
membranes; soybean nodulin-26, a major component of the peribacteroid
membrane; plant tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIP); bacterial glycerol
facilitator protein, which facilitates movement of glycerol across the
cytoplasmic membrane; Salmonella typhimurium propanediol diffusion
facilitator; yeast FPS1, a glycerol uptake/efflux facilitator protein;
Drosophila neurogenic protein 'big brain' (bib) protein, which may mediate
intercellular communication; yeast hypothetical protein YFL054C; and a
hypothetical protein from the pepX region of Lactococcus lactis.

The structures of various members of the MIP family have been determined by
means of X-ray diffraction [6-8], revealing the fold to comprise a right-
handed bundle of 6 transmembrane (TM) alpha-helices [6-8]. Similarities in 
the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule suggest that the proteins may
have arisen through tandem, intragenic duplication of an ancestral protein
that contained 3 TM domains [4].

MINTRINSICP is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
major intrinsic protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 16 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 1 spans the first
putative TM domain; motif 2 includes part of the second putative TM region
and leads into the following cytoplasmic loop (it overlaps the N-terminal
portion of the region encoded by PROSITE pattern MIP (PS00221)); and motifs
3-6 include TM domains 3-6 respectively. Three iterations on OWL29.4 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 117 
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found, all of
which are fragments or family members that fail to make significant matches
with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR55_38f identified a true set of 908 sequences, and
numerous partial matches, all of which are family members that fail to
make significant matches with one or more motifs.
