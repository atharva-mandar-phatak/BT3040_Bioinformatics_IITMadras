CABNDNGRPT
The nodO gene encodes an exported protein that contains a multiple tandem
repeat of a nonapeptide [1]. This nonapeptide has been shown to be 
similar to repeated sequences in a group of bacterial exported proteins 
that includes haemolysin, cyclolysin, leukotoxin and 2 proteases. It has
been suggested that the internally repeated domain of haemolysin may be
involved in Ca-mediated binding to erythrocytes.

CABNDNGRPT is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for these
putative Ca-binding repeats. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 7 sequences: each of the 4 motifs encodes 1 nonapeptide.
Three iterations on OWL10.1 were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 10 sequences was identified.

Three sequences, presumed to be noise, matched just 2 motifs (NGOPOR, 
PK3G37, and SUSARSRNA): matches with individual elements of the fingerprint
were all relatively strong, but each sequence contained only a single copy
of the nonapeptide, while the true set is characterised by multiple copies.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 41 sequences, and 26
partial matches.
