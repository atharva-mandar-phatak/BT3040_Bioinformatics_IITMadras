GLU5KINASE
Glutamate 5-kinase (gamma-glutamyl kinase) catalyses the first step in the
biosynthesis of proline, the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glutamate to 
glutamate 5-phosphate [1,2]. In bacteria, the glutamate 5-kinase gene proB
and the gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase gene (another gene involved in
proline biosynthesis) are part of the same operon [1]. In yeast, studies 
have shown that expression is not repressed by exogenous proline and is not
induced by glutamate in the growth medium, suggesting that the gene (PRO1)
is regulated by the general amino acid control system [2]. The mothbean
plant (Vigna aconitifolia) contains a protein that possesses both glutamate
5-kinase and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase activities [3].

GLU5KINASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
glutamate 5-kinase. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn mainly from the N-terminal half of 
the alignment, motif 6 spanning the central Gly/Ala-rich region encoded by
PROSITE pattern GLUTAMATE_5_KINASE (PS00902). Two iterations on OWL27.0
were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising
14 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 27 sequences.
