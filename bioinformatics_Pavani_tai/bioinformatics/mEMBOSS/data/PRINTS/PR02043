CANCERSCCP1
The CAncer Susceptibility Candidate 1 (CASC1) gene is expressed in lung
tissues, and is a strong candidate for the pulmonary adenoma susceptibility
1 (Pas1) locus, the major determinant of strain variation in lung tumour
susceptibility [1]. There appears to be a strong correlation between
functional polymorphism of CASC1 and lung tumour suspectibility in mice [2].

Different mouse strains fall into two genotype groups (susceptible and 
intermediate) according to differences in the 60th codon of the CASC1 gene
[2]. The mouse CASC1 gene shares 81% similarity with the human equivalent;
the role of CASC1 in human lung-cancer risk may nevertheless differ from
that in mice [1-2]. 

CANCERSCCP1 is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for cancer 
susceptibility candidate protein 1. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length. Two iterations on 
SPTR57.15_40.15f were required to reach convergence, at which point a true
set comprising 10 sequences was identified. Several partial matches were
also found, all of which are translation products that lack portions of 
sequence bearing one or more motifs.
