CCSMST1
Following a subtractive bioinformatics analysis of cattle placenta ESTs, a
number of novel transcripts were identified. Gene-expression profiles and
further bioinformatics analyses have indicated that the identified genes
may be of evolutionary and physiological importance, with possible roles in
placental adaptation [1]. Revealed by this study was so-called Cattle
Cerebrum and Skeletal Muscle-Specific Transcript 1 (CCSMST1) [1], whose
translation product is believed to contain a signal peptide and a single
transmembrane (TM) domain [1].

CCSMST1 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for cattle 
cerebrum and skeletal muscle-specific protein 1. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn 
from conserved regions spanning the central portion of the alignment, motif
3 encoding the putative TM domain. A single iteration on SPTR57.15_40.15f 
was required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.
