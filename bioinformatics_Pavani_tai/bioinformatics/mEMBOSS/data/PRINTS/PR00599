MAPEPTIDASE
Methionine aminopeptidase (MAP) removes the initiator, N-terminal,
methionine from nascent eukaryotic cytosolic and cytoplasmic prokaryotic
proteins where the penultimate amino acid is small and uncharged. MAP
enzymes are monomeric proteins that require cobalt ions for activity. Two
related families of MAPs have been described [1,2], which share sequence
similarity in the region of the cobalt-binding site [3]. The first of these
includes enzymes from prokaryotes as well as eukaryotic MAP-1. 

MAPEPTIDASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
methionine aminopeptidase 1. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 3 including part of the
region encoded by PROSITE pattern MAP_1 (PS00680), which contains residues
known to be involved in colbalt-binding. Two iterations on OWL28.1 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 15
sequences was identified. Several partial matches were also found,
including a number of fragments and X-PRO aminopeptidases.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 33 sequences, and 19
partial matches.
