PUROTHIONIN
Thionins are small plant proteins that are toxic to animal cells. The
proteins belong to a functionally related family, which includes alpha-
and beta-thionins from wheat and barley, and gamma-purothionins. Gamma-
purothionin inhibits protein translation in cell-free systems. It is a
single polypeptide chain of 47 amino acids and contains 4 disulphide
bridges [1]. The folded structure is characterised by a well-defined 
3-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and a short alpha-helix [2]. Three
disulphide bridges are located in the hydrophobic core between the helix
and sheet, forming a cysteine-stabilised alpha-helical motif. This 
structure differs from that of the plant alpha- and beta- thionins, but
is analogous to scorpion toxins and insect defensins.

PUROTHIONIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
gamma-purothionins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 3 sequences: the motifs span the full alignment length. Two iterations
on OWL23.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 11 sequences was identified. A single fragment was also found,
S31346, which lacks the final motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 23 sequences, and 1
partial match.
