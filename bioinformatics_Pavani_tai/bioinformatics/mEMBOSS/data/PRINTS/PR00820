CBXXCFQX
The Cfx genes in Alcaligenes eutrophus encode a number of Calvin cycle
enzymes [1]. The observed sizes of two of the gene products, CfxX and CfxY,
are 35kDa and 27kDa respectively [1]. No functions could be assigned to
CfxX and CfxY. These proteins show a high degree of similarity to the
B.subtilis stage V sporulation protein K [2].

CBXXCFQX is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
CbxX/CfqX proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 6 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning
the full alignment length, focusing on those regions that characterise the
CBXX/CFQX proteins but distinguish them from the closely related stage V 
sporulation proteins. Two iterations on OWL30.0 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences.
