ANTSNTHASEI
Anthranilate synthase catalyses the reaction: chorismate + l-glutamine = 
anthranilate + pyruvate + l-glutamate. The enzyme is a tetramer comprising
2 I and 2 II components: component I catalyses the formation of 
anthranilate using ammonia rather than glutamine, while component II
provides glutamine amidotransferase activity.

ANTSNTHASEI is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
anthranilate synthase type I components. The fingerprint was derived from
an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs encode conserved regions
towards the C-terminus of the alignment. Four iterations on OWL11.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 18
sequences was identified. Three partial matches were also found.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 53 sequences, and 7
partial matches.
