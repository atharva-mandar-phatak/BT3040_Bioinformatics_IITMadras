KIR22CHANNEL
Potassium channels are found in virtually all cell types. Their pore-
forming subunits fall into three structural families, i.e. those possessing
six, four and two transmembrane (TM) domains. The six-TM domain K+ channels
can be further subdivided into six families: the voltage-gated K+ channels
(Kv), the KCNQ channels, the eag-like K+ channels, and three Ca2+-activated
K+ channels. Inwardly-rectifying K+ channels (Kir) are the principal class
of two-TM domain K+ channels, and the recently-discovered two-pore domain
K+ channels, make up a family of four-TM domain K+ channels.

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are responsible for regulating
diverse processes including: cellular excitability, vascular tone, heart
rate, renal salt flow, and insulin release [1]. To date, around twenty
members of this superfamily have been cloned, which can be grouped into six
families by sequence similarity - these are designated Kir1.x-7.x [2,3].

Cloned Kir channel cDNAs encode proteins of between ~370-500 residues,
containing two predicted TM domains, with the characteristic K+ channel
pore-forming domain located between them. Both N- and C-termini are thought
to be cytoplasmic, and the N-terminus lacks a signal sequence. It is thought
that four Kir subunits assemble to form a tetrameric channel complex, which
may be hetero- or homomeric [1].

Kir2.2 (also known as IRK2/BIR8), like other Kir2.x family members, has
been found to be expressed in the brain. Immuno-localisation studies have
revealed it is primarily expressed in the cerebellum, as opposed to the
forebrain (cf. Kir1.1). It is also expressed to lower extents in the
kidney, heart and skeletal muscle. When heterologously expressed in Xenopus
oocytes, human Kir2.2 produced strong, inwardly rectifying K+ currents.
Co-expression of Kir2.2v (a closely related Kir2.x subunit) with Kir2.2
caused an inhibition of induced K+ currents, indicating that it likely
functions as a negative regulator of Kir2.2 [4].

KIR22CHANNEL is a 12-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Kir2.2 inward rectifier K+ channel. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved
regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, focusing on those
sections that characterise Kir2.2 but distinguish it from other subtypes -
motifs 1-2 lie in the putative cytoplasmic N-terminus; motifs 3-4 lie
between the first TM domain and the following pore-forming (H5) domain; and
motifs 5-12 encode portions of the cytoplasmic C-terminus. A single
iteration on SPTR37_10f was required to reach convergence, no further
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. One partial match was
also identified, O43401, a closely related human sequence, identified as an
inwardly rectifying K+ channel negative regulator, which lacks the
N-terminal third of the molecule bearing the first 4 motifs.
