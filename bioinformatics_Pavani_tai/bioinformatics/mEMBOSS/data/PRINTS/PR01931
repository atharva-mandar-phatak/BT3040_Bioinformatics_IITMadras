INTRLEUKIN16
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-16 (IL-16, also known as lymphocyte chemoattractant factor) is
a proinflammatory cytokine that signals via CD4, inducing chemotactic and
immunomodulatory responses of CD4+ lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils
[1]. The cytokine has been implicated in the exacerbation of a number of 
infectious, immune-mediated and autoimmune inflammatory disorders, 
including atopic dermatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections [2].

INTRLEUKIN16 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-16. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually 
the full alignment length, motifs 2 and 3 encompassing short regions of beta
strand. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 28 sequences was identified.
