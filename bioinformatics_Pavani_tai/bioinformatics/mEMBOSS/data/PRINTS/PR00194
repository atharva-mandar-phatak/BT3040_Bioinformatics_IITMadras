TROPOMYOSIN
Tropomyosins are closely related proteins present in both muscle and non-
muscle cells, and are key regulatory proteins in skeletal muscle contraction
[1]. The proteins are completely alpha-helical, forming a coiled-coil
structure of 2 parallel helices containing 2 sets of 7 alternating actin
binding sites [2]. There are multiple cell-specific isoforms, created by
differential splicing of the messenger RNA from one gene, but the
proportions of the isoforms vary between different cell types.

Muscle tropomyosin, in association with troponin, regulates the calcium-
sensitive interaction of actin and myosin. In smooth muscle, however, which
is devoid of troponin, this interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation
of myosin by myosin light chain kinase, and hence a different form of 
tropomyosin in neccessary. This different isoform lacks a C-terminal region,
which is thought to contain the troponin binding site [3].
                             
TROPOMYOSIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
muscle and non-muscle forms of tropomyosin. The fingerprint was derived 
from an initial alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from  
conserved regions spanning virtually the full alignment length, motif 5
including the region encoded by PROSITE pattern TROPOMYOSIN (PS00326). Two
iterations on OWL20.0 were required to reach convergence, at which point a
true set comprising 67 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 103 sequences, and 2
partial matches.
