CGMPKINASE
Little is known in detail about the biological functions of cGMP-dependent
protein kinases, but they are known to play a role in smooth muscle
relaxation, ion fluxes in kidneys and intestines, and neuronal function.
In recent years, identification of genes coding for these proteins has
made their isolation easier, leading to an increase in our understanding
of the cells in which they are present and the functions they possess.

The predominant form of cGMP-dependent protein kinase is a dimer of
identical 75kDa subunits, although larger subunits of 86 and 130kDa have
been found [1]. The enzyme is kept in an inactive form by the interaction
of the catalytic domain of one subunit with the region on the other subunit
that precedes the cGMP binding domain. Each subunit contains 2 cGMP-binding
regions, found together in the sequence: binding of 2 molecules of cGMP
precipitates a conformational change in the active site that allows the
substrate to bind.

Although cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases are similar both in
structure and sequence around the nucleotide binding site, and in the 
method of activation and inactivation, there are some basic contrasts. The
major difference is that all of the functional domains of the cGMP-
dependent enzymes are found on a single polypeptide chain, whereas cAMP-
dependent protein kinases have separate regulatory (cAMP binding) and
catalytic chains. 

CGMPKINASE is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the second
cGMP-binding region (see Takio et al. [2]). Two iterations on OWL11.0 were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 11
sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
