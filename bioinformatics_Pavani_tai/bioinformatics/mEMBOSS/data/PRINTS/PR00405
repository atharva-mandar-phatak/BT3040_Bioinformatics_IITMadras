REVINTRACTNG
The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) facilitates
nuclear export of unspliced and partly-spliced viral RNAs [1]. Rev contains
an RNA-binding domain and an effector domain; the latter is believed to 
interact with a cellular cofactor required for the Rev response and hence
HIV-1 replication [1]. Human Rev interacting protein (hRIP) specifically
interacts with the Rev effector. The amino acid sequence of hRIP is 
characterised by an N-terminal, C-4 class zinc finger motif.

REVINTRACTNG is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
hRIP family of zinc finger proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs span the full zinc finger
domain. Two iterations on OWL26.3 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 12 sequences was identified. Three
partial matches were also found, all of which match motif 2, but fail to
make significant matches with either motifs 1 or 3.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 29 sequences, and 1
partial match.
