SALSPVAPROT
Salmonella typhimurium contains a 90kb plasmid that is associated with
virulence [1]. This plasmid encodes at least 6 genes needed by the
bacterium for invading host macrophages during infection. These include
the 70kDa mkaA protein [1], a recognised virulence factor, and more
recently described, four spv genes under the control of a regulator [2].

Deletion studies on the virulence plasmid have shown that an open reading 
frame encoding a 28kDa protein was needed for successful invasion of the 
host. This protein, designated mkfA [1], VRP4 [3] or VirA [4] by different
groups, is utilised by the microbe upon entry into macrophages, although the 
exact mechanism is unclear.  

SALSPVAPROT is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
Salmonella virulence plasmid 28.1kDa A protein family. The fingerprint
was derived from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were
drawn from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length (~250 amino 
acids). Two iterations on SPTR37_10f were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.
