AMELOGENIN
Amelogenins, cell adhesion proteins, play a role in the biomineralisation of
teeth. They seem to regulate formation of crystallites during the secretory
stage of tooth enamel development and are thought to play a major role in
the structural organisation and mineralisation of developing enamel. The
extracellular matrix of the developing enamel comprises two major classes 
of protein: the hydrophobic amelogenins and the acidic enamelins [1].

Circular dichroism studies of porcine amelogenin have shown that the protein
consists of 3 discrete folding units [2]: the N-terminal region appears to
contain beta-strand structures, while the C-terminal region displays
characteristics of a random coil conformation. Subsequent studies on the 
bovine protein have indicated the amelogenin structure to contain a
repetitive beta-turn segment and a "beta-spiral" between Gln112 and Leu138,
which sequester a (Pro, Leu, Gln) rich region [3]. The beta-spiral
offers a probable site for interactions with Ca2+ ions.

Muatations in the human amelogenin gene (AMGX) cause X-linked hypoplastic
amelogenesis imperfecta, a disease characterised by defective enamel. A 9bp
deletion in exon 2 of AMGX results in the loss of codons for Ile5, Leu6, 
Phe7 and Ala8, and replacement by a new threonine codon, disrupting
the 16-residue (Met1-Ala16) amelogenin signal peptide [4].

AMELOGENIN is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
amelogenins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 8
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on SPTR40_20f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 21 sequences was
identified. Several partial matches were also found, all murine or porcine
amelogenin sequences that failed to make significant matches with one or
more motifs.
