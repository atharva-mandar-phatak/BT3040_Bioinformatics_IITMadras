BONTOXILYSIN
There are seven antigenically distinct forms of botulinum neurotoxin, 
designated A, B, C1, D, E, F and G. The seven neurotoxins are potent
protein toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral
cholinergic synapses [1]. On binding to the neuronal synapses, the
molecules are internalised and move by retrograde transport up the axon
into the spinal cord, where they can move between post- and presynaptic
neurons. The toxin inhibits neurotransmitter release by acting as a zinc
endopeptidase.

The protein toxins exist as disulphide-linked heterodimers of light and 
heavy chains. The light chain has the pharmacological activity, while the
N- and C-termini of the heavy chain mediate channel formation and toxin
binding [1]. The light chain exhibits a high level of sequence similarity
to tetanus toxin (TeTx). Alignment of all characterised neurotoxin sequences
reveals the presence of highly conserved amino acid domains interspersed
with amino acid tracts with little overall similarity. The most divergent
region corresponds to the C-terminal extremity of each toxin, which may
reflect differences in specificity of binding to neurone acceptor sites [2].

BONTOXILYSIN is a 6-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bontoxilysins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of
14 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions within the
N-terminal portion of the alignment (i.e., the light chain). Two iterations
on OWL29.4 were required to reach convergence at which point a true
set comprising 35 sequences was identified. Several partial matches
were also found, all of which are fragments or family members that
fail to make significant matches with one or more motifs.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 36 sequences.
