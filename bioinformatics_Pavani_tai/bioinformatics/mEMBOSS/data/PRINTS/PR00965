OCULARALBNSM
Ocular albinism type 1 (OA1) is an X-linked disorder characterised by severe
impairment of visual acuity, retinal hypopigmentation and the presence of
macromelanosomes [1]. A novel transcript has been isolated from the OA1
critical region, which is expressed in high levels in RNA samples from
retina and from melanoma [1]. The gene encodes a potential integral membrane
protein of 424 residues that contains several putative transmembrane (TM)
domains, but shows no similarities to other known sequences. 

OCULARALBNSM is a 9-element fingerprint that provides a signature for ocular
albinism type 1 proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial 
alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions 
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1-3 include the N-terminal 
residues of the first, second and third putative TM domains; motifs 5 and 6
span the fourth and fifth TM domains; motif 7 includes the N-terminal 
residues of TM domain 6; motif 8 spans TM domain 7; and motif 9 lies at the
C-terminus. A single iteration on OWL30.2 was requried to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
