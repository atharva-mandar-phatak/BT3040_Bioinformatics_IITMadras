INTLKN15BIRD
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including 
stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [1]. It is 
required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype, a process that
is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [2]. The numbers of CD8+ memory T cells
in animals may, therefore, be controlled by a balance between IL-15 and -2.

IL-15 has been identified in mammals, birds and fish. Avian IL-15s are 
expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, including liver,
muscle, heart, and intraepithelial lymphocytes [3]. They have been shown to
stimulate the growth of spleen T-cells and to enhance the activity of 
natural killer (NK) cells [3]. 

INTLKN15BIRD is is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
avian interleukin-15. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment 
of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning 
virtually the full alignment length. A single iteration on SPTR55_38f was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified beyond
the starting set.
