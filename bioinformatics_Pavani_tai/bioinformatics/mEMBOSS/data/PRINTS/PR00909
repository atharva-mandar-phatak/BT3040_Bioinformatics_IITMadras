SPERMDNBNDNG
The nucleotide sequences of the genes for the spermidine and putrescine
transport systems that map at 15 and 19 min on the E.coli chromosome have
been determined [1,2]. The former was shown to contain four open reading 
frames encoding protein products PotA to PotD [1]; the latter also contained
four ORFs, designated PotF to PotI [2]. The D protein has been inferred to
be a periplasmic polyamine binding protein that regulates polyamine content
in E.coli [1]; similarly, PotF was inferred to be a periplasmic putrescine-
specific binding protein [2]. The PotD and PotF proteins show a high degree
of sequence similarity.

The 3D structure of PotD complexed with spermidine has been solved to 2.5A
resolution [2]. The structure comprises two domains, with alternating beta-
alpha-beta topology. The polyamine binding site lies in a central cleft at
the domain interface. Within the cleft, four acidic residues recognise the
three positively charged nitrogen atoms of spermidine, and five aromatic
side chains anchor the methylene backbone by van der Waals interactions [2].
The overall fold of PotD is similar to that of other periplasmic binding
proteins, especially to the E.coli maltodextrin-binding protein, despite 
low sequence identity [2]. Structure comparisons suggest that spermidine
binding rearranges the relative orientation of the PotD domains, creating
a more compact structure [2].

SPERMDNBNDNG is a 10-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
bacterial periplasmic spermidine/putrescine-binding proteins. The 
fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 sequences: the 
motifs were drawn from short conserved regions spanning the full alignment
length. A single iteration on OWL30.1 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. Several
partial matches were found, all of which are fragments.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 7 sequences, and 3
partial matches.
