BPLRPCIII
Lambda phage regulatory protein CIII is a small protein that plays a role
in stabilising the CII transcriptional activator, via a mechanism that
is not yet fully understood [1,2]. Stabilised CII activates CI, the gene for 
the repressor protein that prevents transcription of proteins required
for lytic development. The central portion of the protein is well conserved
and is both necessary and sufficient for the activity of the protein [1].
Comparative analysis of the CIII sequence in lambda, HK022 and the lambdoid
bacteriophage P22 has led to the suggestion that this central region assumes
an amphipathic alpha-helical structure [1]. 

BPLRPCIII is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
bacteriophage lambda regulatory protein C3. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 3 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the
central portion of the alignment, and span the region encoded by PROSITE
pattern LAMBDA_PHAGE_CIII (PS00553). A single iteration on OWL30.2 was
required to reach convergence, no further sequences being identified
beyond the starting set.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
