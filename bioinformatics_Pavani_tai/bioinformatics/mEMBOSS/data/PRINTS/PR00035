HTHGNTR
Numerous bacterial transcription regulatory proteins bind DNA via a 
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. These proteins are very diverse, but for
convenience may be grouped into subfamilies on the basis of sequence
similarity. One such family groups together a range of proteins, including
gntR, hutC, korA, and E.coli proteins A, P30, fadR and phnF [1-3]. Within 
this family, the HTH motif is situated towards the N-terminus.

HTHGNTR is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the HTH
motif of the gntR bacterial regulatory proteins. The fingerprint was
derived from an initial alignment of 6 sequences: the motifs completely
encompass the HTH motif, extending a few residues beyond its N- and C-
termini (cf. PROSITE pattern HTH_GNTR_FAMILY (PS00043)). Two iterations on 
OWL21.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point a true set
comprising 12 sequences was identified. The Streptomyces korA protein,
which is not identified by the PROSITE pattern, also escapes detection by
the fingerprint, as it matches strongly only with motif 1.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 66 sequences.
