BCTERIALGSPC
The general (type II) secretion pathway (GSP) within Gram-negative bacteria
is a signal sequence-dependent process repsonsible for protein export [1-3].
The process has two stages: exoproteins are first translocated across the
inner membrane by the general signal-dependent export pathway (GEP), and 
then across the outer membrane by a species-specific accessory mechanism. 

A number of molecules are involved in the GSP; one of these is known as the
'C' protein, the most probable location of which is the inner membrane [4].  
This suggests that protein C is part of the GEP apparatus, aiding trans-
location of exoproteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, prior to 
transport across the outer membrane. The N-terminal domain, which contains
a single hydrophobic region, is thought to be cytoplasmic, and the much 
larger C-terminal domain periplasmic. 

BCTERIALGSPC is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
general secretion pathway protein C. The fingerprint was derived from an
initial alignment of 8 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions in the periplasmic domain - motif 2 includes the region encoded by
PROSITE pattern T2SP_C (PS01141), which lies towards the C-terminus. A 
single iteration on OWL30.0 was required to reach convergence, no further 
sequences being identified beyond the starting set. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 6 sequences.
