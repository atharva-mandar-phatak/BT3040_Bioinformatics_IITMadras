OREXINPP
Orexins (also known as hypocretins) are recently identified neuropeptides
that are specifically localised to the hypothalamus. They are thought to
interact with autonomic, neurendocrine and neuroregulatory systems, and play
an important role in the regulation of feeding behaviour [1,2]. When applied
to hypothalamic neurones, these peptides are neuroexcitatory, which action
is probably mediated by their binding to a new family of G protein-coupled
receptors (orexin receptors 1 and 2), which were previously orphan [3].

To date, two orexins have been characterised (orexin-A and -B), both encoded
by a single mRNA transcript (prepro-orexin): orexin-A is a 33-residue
peptide with two intramolecular disulphide bonds in the N-terminal region;
and orexin-B is a linear 28-residue peptide. These peptides have 46%
identity at the amino acid sequence level, and show some similarity to the
glucagon/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/secretin peptide family.

OREXINPP is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for prepro-
orexin. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 2 sequences: 
the motifs were drawn from the central portion of the alignment, which 
characterises prepro-orexins and distinguishes them from the secretin-
related peptides (to which greatest similarity is shown in the C-terminal
region). Two iterations on OWL31.1 were required to reach convergence, at
which point a true set comprising 4 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 4 sequences.
