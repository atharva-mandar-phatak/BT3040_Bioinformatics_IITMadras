TSP1REPEAT
The TSP1 (thrombospondin 1) repeat was first identified in the
thrombospondin protein, where it is repeated 3 times [1]. The domain is 
~60 amino acid residues in length and is characterised by a highly 
conserved W-S-X-W motif and six cysteine residues [2]. TSP1 repeats have  
been identified in a number of proteins including: the complement pathway
proteins properdin, C6, C7, C8A, C8B and C9; extracellular matrix proteins,
including mindin, ADAMTS and F-spondin; Plasmodium TRAP proteins; and G 
protein-coupled receptors, such as the brain-specific angiogenesis 
inhibitors [2]. The domains have a number of functions, including effects 
on cell attachment, motility, proliferation, the activities of extracellular
proteases, and inhibition of angiogenesis, contributing to vascular 
homeostasis [2]. A study of the structure of properdin indicates that the 
TSP1 repeat contains two amphipathic turn regions and a hydrophilic 
beta-strand [3].

TSP1REPEAT is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
thrombospondin type 1 repeat. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 5 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
spanning the full length of the domain - motif 1 encodes the well-conserved
N-terminal portion, including the W-S-X-W motif; and motifs 2 and 3 span the
less conserved central and C-terminal portions of the repeat, respectively.
Four iterations on SPTR40_18f were required to reach convergence, at which
point a true set comprising 87 sequences was identified. Numerous partial
matches were also found: all are thrombospondin repeat-containing proteins
that fail to match one of the motifs.
