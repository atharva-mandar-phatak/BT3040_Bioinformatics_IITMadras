UPF0595
UPF0595 encompasses a small family of conserved but, as yet, functionally
uncharacterised proteins found in a range of organisms, including human,
chicken and Drosophila [1-3]. The sequences are typically 100-150 amino 
acids in length, each containing 8 or more cysteine residues with
characteristic spacings. 

UPF0595 is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for UPF0595
uncharacterised proteins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 9 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions
spanning the full alignment length - motifs 1, 3 and 4 encode a number of
characteristically conserved cysteine residues, while motif 2 includes a
well-conserved DPF motif. Three iterations on SPTR57_40f were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 19 sequences was
identified. Five partial matches were also found, all of which are likely
homologues that fail to make significant matches with one or more motifs.
