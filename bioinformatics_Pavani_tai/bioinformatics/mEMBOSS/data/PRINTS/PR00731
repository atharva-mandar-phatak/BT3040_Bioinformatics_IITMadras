CAULIMOPTASE
Cauliflower mosaic viruses belong to a group of plant viruses known as
pararetroviruses, which have a double-stranded DNA genome [1]. The genome
includes an open reading frame (ORF V) that shows similarities to the pol
gene of retroviruses [1]. This ORF codes for a polyprotein that includes
a reverse transcriptase, which, on the basis of a DTG triplet near the
N-terminus, was suggested to include an aspartic protease [1].

The presence of an aspartic protease has been confirmed by mutational
studies, implicating Asp-45 in catalysis [1]. The protease releases itself
from the polyprotein and is involved in reactions required to process the
ORF IV polyprotein, which includes the viral coat protein gene [1]. 

CAULIMOPTASE is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
cauliflower mosaic virus aspartate protease. The fingerprint was derived
from an initial alignment of 7 sequences: the motifs were drawn from
conserved regions within the gag/pol protease domain, motif 2 containing 
the catalytic aspartate residue. Two iterations on OWL29.2 were required
to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 12 sequences
was identified. A single partial match was also found, PCU139881, a
fragment lacking the region of sequence bearing the first motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 12 sequences.
