INTRLEUKIN15
Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in
the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating
growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including 
stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [1]. It is 
required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype, a process that
is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [2]. The numbers of CD8+ memory T cells
in animals may, therefore, be controlled by a balance between IL-15 and -2.

INTRLEUKIN15 is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 
interleukin-15. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 31
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning the
C-terminal two thirds of the alignment. Two iterations on SPTR55_38f were
required to reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 32
sequences was identified. Two partial matches were also found, Q1AHQ7_MOUSE
and Q1AHQ6_MOUSE, mouse interleukin-15 isoforms that fail to match motifs 1
and 2 respectively.
