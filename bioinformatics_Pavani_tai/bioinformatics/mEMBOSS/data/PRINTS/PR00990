RIBOKINASE
Ribokinases participate in the first step of ribose metabolism, and are 
members of the superfamily of carbohydrate kinases. Ribokinases phosphory-
late ribose to ribose-5-phosphate in the presence of ATP and magnesium [1]:

	   ATP + D-Ribose = ADP + D-Ribose-5-Phosphate

The phosphorylated sugar may then enter the pentose phosphate pathway [2].

There are indications that the phosphorylated sugar may also be used in the
synthesis of amino acids (histidine and tryptophan). Further, links to
mammalian adenosine kinase have been identified, through sequence
similarity, suggesting possible homology [2,3].

RIBOKINASE is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
ribokinases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 5 
sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions spanning virtually
the full alignment length. Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach
convergence, at which point a true set comprising 8 sequences was identified.
Two partial matches were also found, both of which are related fructokinases
that match motifs 2 and 5.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 9 sequences, and 5
partial matches.
