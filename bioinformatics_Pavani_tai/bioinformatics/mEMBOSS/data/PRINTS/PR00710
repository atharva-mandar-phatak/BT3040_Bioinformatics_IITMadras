NATPEPTIDES
Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) are vertebrate hormones that play an
important role in the control of cardiovascular homeostatis, and sodium
and water balance in general [1-3]. There are different NPs that vary in
length but share a common core. All are processed from a single precursor.
A disulphide bond resident in the C-terminal section is required for full
activity of atriopeptins.

The family of NPs includes structurally-related peptides that elicit 
similar pharmacological spectra: amongst these are brain natriuretic
peptide (BNP); C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP); ventricular natriuretic
peptide (VNP) [4]; and green mamba natriuretic peptide (DNP) [5]. 

NATPEPTIDES is a 2-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
natriuretic peptide family. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 21 sequences: the motifs were drawn from the common conserved
C-terminal region, spanning the section encoded by PROSITE pattern
NATRIURETIC_PEPTIDE (PS00263), which includes the two functionally important
cysteines and two conserved glycines, which may be important for the
conformation of the peptides. Two iterations on OWL29.3 were required to
reach convergence, at which point a true set comprising 46 sequences was
identified. 

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 39 sequences.
