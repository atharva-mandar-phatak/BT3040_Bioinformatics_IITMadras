CHROMOGRANIN
Chromogranins and secretogranins are acidic proteins present in the
secretory granules of endocrine and neuro-endocrine cells [1,2]. Granins 
may be precursors of biologically-active peptides, or they may be helper
proteins in the packaging of peptide hormones and neuropeptides - their
precise role is unclear. 

Similarity between these proteins is confined to short N- and C-terminal
regions: chromogranins A and B are characterised by an N-terminal motif
that includes 2 cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond formation;
and chromogranins and secretogranins together share a C-terminal motif.   

CHROMOGRANIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
chromogranins A and B. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
of 8 sequences: motifs 1 and 2 were drawn from the N-terminus, and span
the region encoded by PROSITE pattern GRANINS_2 (PS00423), which includes
the conserved cysteine residues; and motif 3 lies at the C-terminus, and
spans the region encoded by PROSITE pattern GRANINS_1 (PS00422). Two
iterations on OWL29.1 were required to reach convergence, at which point
a true set comprising 14 sequences was identified.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 10 sequences.
