GUANYLIN
Guanylin, a 15-amino-acid peptide, is an endogenous ligand of the intestinal
receptor guanylate cyclase-C, known as STaR [1,2]. Upon receptor binding,
guanylin increases the intracellular concentration of cGMP, it induces
chloride secretion and decreases intestinal fluid absorption, ultimately
causing diarrhoea [3]. The peptide stimulates the enzyme through the same
receptor binding region as the heat-stable enterotoxins [2].

GUANYLIN is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for
guanylins and uroguanylins. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved
regions spanning the full alignment length - motif 5 includes the guanylin
peptide. A single iteration on OWL29.4 was required to reach convergence,
no further sequences being identified beyond the starting set. A single
partial match was found, CPGUAGGEN1, a guinea pig guanylin that fails to
make a significant match with the final motif.

An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 11 sequences, and 1
partial match.
