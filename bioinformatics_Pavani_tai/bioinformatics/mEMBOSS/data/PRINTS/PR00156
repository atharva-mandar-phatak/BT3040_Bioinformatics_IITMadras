COPPERBLUE
Type I blue copper proteins are found in methylothropic bacteria, where
they appear to function as the electron acceptor to methylamine dehydro-
genase [1]. They bind a single copper atom and are characterised by an
intense electronic absorption band near 600nm [2]. Several classes of blue
copper protein have been identified, including amicyanins, azurins,
pseudoazurins, plastocyanins and rusticyanins. Based on their primary
sequences, amicyanins appear to be most closely related to the plant
plastocyanins, and are also highly similar to the pseudoazurins. By
contrast, the rusticyanins fall into a distinct subclass.

The fold of type I blue copper proteins is a beta-sandwich, built from
9 beta-strands. The copper atom is located between 3 loops on one end of
the molecule. Two of these loops contribute the copper ligands. The other
3 ligands are located on the loop between strands 8 and 9.

COPPERBLUE is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the
type I copper blue protein family. The fingerprint was derived from an 
initial alignment of 11 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved 
regions spanning the full alignment length, motif 3 including the Cys and
His residues involved in copper binding (cf. PROSITE pattern COPPER_BLUE
(PS00196)). Three iterations on OWL25.1 were required to reach convergence,
at which point a true set comprising 59 sequences was identified. 

An update on SPTR57.15_40.15f identified a true set of 179 sequences and
85 partial matches.
